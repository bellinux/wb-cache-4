40|$|Generating high barrier <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> for {{anticorrosive}} coating {{systems is}} increasingly performed using powder coatings. Such <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> are usually {{combined with a}} priming zinc or zinc containing layer applied via metallisation, (hat dip) galvanisation or via a powder zinc primer. Since each of these methods implicates certain disadvantages, here, some trial formulations of liquid zinc primers are proposed alternatively, which may be combined with a powder <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> In order to contribute to an advantageaus carbon footprint and a reduced Zn emission, these formulations aimed at improved durability, reduced zinc pigment concentration or a waterbased binder. It is explored to which extent an addition of a degassing agent could prevent pinhole formation in the powder <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> caused by primer solvent residues evaporated during powder <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> curing. Moreover, some test results concerning the proteelive properfies of the zinc primers are reported...|$|R
30|$|A TBC is a {{multilayer}} {{coating system}} {{that consists of}} an insulating ceramic outer layer (<b>top</b> <b>coat)</b> and a metallic inner layer (bond coat) between the ceramic and the substrate. The function of the ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> is to insulate the metallic substrate from high surface temperature, thereby lowering the component’s temperature and reducing the oxidation and hot corrosion of bond coatings while simultaneously reducing cyclic thermal strains (Gurrappa and Sambasiva 2006). Recently, Kitazawa et al. (2010) have reported that a temperature gradient of 150 °C {{can be achieved by}} using a ceramic TBC (Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 <b>top</b> <b>coat)</b> on superalloy components. In most cases, the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> and bond coats are applied by plasma spraying; however, sputtering and electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) are also used. The commonly used method of thermal spraying of TBCs on developed metal surfaces involves a metallic bond coating either by cold spraying (CS) or by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) followed by deposition of a ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> by either air plasma spraying (APS) or EBPVD.|$|R

50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} typically consist of four layers: the metal substrate, metallic bond coat, thermally-grown oxide (TGO), and ceramic topcoat. The ceramic topcoat is typically composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which is desirable for having very low conductivity while remaining stable at nominal operating temperatures typically seen in applications. This ceramic layer creates the largest thermal gradient of the TBC {{and keeps the}} lower layers at a lower temperature than the surface. However, above 1200 °C, YSZ suffers from unfavorable phase transformations, going from t'-tetragonal to tetragonal to cubic to monoclinic. Such phase transformations lead to crack formation within the <b>top</b> <b>coating.</b> Recent advancements in finding an alternative for YSZ ceramic topcoat identified many novel ceramics (rare earth zirconates) having superior performance at temperatures above 1200 °C, however with inferior fracture toughness {{compared to that of}} YSZ. In addition, such zirconates may have a high concentration of oxygen ion vacancies, which may facilitate oxygen transport and exacerbate the formation of the TGO. With a large enough TGO, spalling of the coating may occur, which is a catastrophic mode of failure for TBCs. The use of such coatings would require addition coatings that are more oxidation resistant, such as alumina or mullite.|$|E
40|$|A substrate, {{such as a}} turbine blade, vane, or the like, {{which is}} {{subjected}} to high temperature use is coated with a base coating of an oxide dispersed, metallic alloy (cermet). A <b>top</b> <b>coating</b> of an oxidation, hot corrosion, erosion resistant alloy of nickel, cobalt, or iron is then deposited on the base coating. A heat treatment is used to improve the bonding. The base coating serves as an inhibitor to interdiffusion between the protective <b>top</b> <b>coating</b> and the substrate. Otherwise, the protective <b>top</b> <b>coating</b> would rapidly interact detrimentally with the substrate and degrade by spalling of the protective oxides formed on the outer surface at elevated temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Plasma-sprayed {{thermal barrier}} {{coatings}} (TBC s) were thermal cycle tested in air at 1163 C until spallation of the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> Each thermal cycle {{consisted of a}} 45 minute exposure at the elevated temperature followed by a 15 minute cool to ambient temperature. The TBC s consisted of a ZrO 2 -based <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> containing various amounts of Y 2 O 3, and/or Yb 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, and Nd 2 O 3 applied by air plasma spraying and an MCrAlY bond coat applied by low pressure plasma spraying. The substrate was a single-crystal, Ni-based superalloy. The time to failure of the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> varied from tens to hundreds of thermal cycles based on composition and spray parameters.

A numerical heat flow model has been used to explore the stress state under isothermal and thermal gradient conditions. Sintering proceeds faster at higher temperature, but is retarded by the presence of tensile stresses (from differential thermal expansion between coating and substrate) within the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> Sintering occurs preferentially near the free surface of the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> under gradient conditions, {{not only because of the}} higher temperature, but also because the in-plane stress is more compressive in that region...|$|R

40|$|Advanced and {{baseline}} {{thermal barrier}} coatings (TBCs) were thermal cycle tested in air at 1163 C until delamination or spallation of the ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> The <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> {{of the advanced}} TBC s consisted of ZrO 2 with various amounts of Y 2 O 3, Yb 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, or Nd 2 O 3 dopants.

40|$|Thermal spray {{coatings}} (TSCs) have complex microstructures {{and they}} often operate in demanding environments. Plasma sprayed (PS) thermal barrier coating (TBC) is one such ceramic layer that is applied onto metallic components where a low macroscopic stiffness favors stability by limiting the stresses from differential thermal contraction. In this paper, the Young’s modulus of TBC <b>top</b> <b>coat,</b> measured using different techniques, such as four-point bending, indentation and impulse excitation is reported, along with {{a brief description of}} how the techniques probe different length scales. Zirconia-based TBC <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> were found to have a much lower global stiffness than that of dense zirconia. A typical value for the as-sprayed Young’s modulus was ~ 23 GPa, determined by beam bending. Indentation, probing a local area, gave significantly higher values. The difference between the two stiffness values is thought to explain the wide range of TBC <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> Young’s modulus values reported in the literature. On exposure to high temperature, due to the sintering process, detached <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> exhibit an increase in stiffness. This increase in stiffness caused by the sintering of fine-scale porosity has significant impact on the strain tolerance of the TBC. The paper discusses the different techniques for measuring the Young’s modulus of the TBC <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> and implications of the measured values...|$|R
40|$|This {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to study {{the effect of the}} presence of Na 2 SO 4 deposits and water vapor on the oxidation of an air plasma-sprayed TBC composed of a partially stabilized ZrO 2 <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> with an underlying NiCoCrAlY bond coat. XRD and SEM/EDX were used to analyze the changes in the coatings after oxidation at 1000 degreesC for 72 hours in dry or humidified (containing 50 % H 2 O) O- 2 atmosphere, with or without Na 2 SO 4 deposited on the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> When oxidized in oxygen, bond coat oxide regions, consisting of almost pure aluminum oxide, were formed at the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> / bond coat and bond coat / substrate interfaces and in the bond coat around the splat lines. When water vapor was present, the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> / bond coat interface oxide was marginally thicker and included small regions with more chromium, cobalt and nickel. The addition of the salt deposits resulted in some destabilization in the outermost regions of the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> The salt deposits also caused the formation of thicker oxide comprising two regions, though this formation was observed only at the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> / bond coat interface. The first type was a thin inner (i. e. bordering the bond coat) oxide that was mostly aluminum oxide. The other was a much thicker oxide containing higher levels of chromium, cobalt and nickel along with aluminum.
