60|$|I {{asked whether}} the {{majority}} of these unfortunate young women really tried to support their children. The answer was that most of them <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> indeed, and will use all their money for this purpose, even stinting themselves of absolute necessaries. Few of them go wrong again after their first slip, as they have learned their lesson. Moreover, during their stay in hospital and afterwards, the Salvation Army does its best to impress on them certain moral teachings, and thus to make its work preventive as well as remedial.|$|E

Farewell, farewell, Macumazahn, if you must go. But why--why did you not run away with Mameena, and save me all this fear and trouble?" ...|$|E

60|$|She {{is younger}} than Mr. Don, who, despite her efforts {{for many years}} to cover his deficiencies, is a man of no great account in a {{household}} where the bigger personality of his wife swallows him like an Aaron's rod.

All the lovely things which happened in that house in the days when Dick was alive were between him and her; those two shut the door softly on old Don, always anxious not to hurt his feelings, and then ran into each other's arms.|$|E
60|$|From {{that time}} Jims lived a shamelessly double life. Whenever he was shut {{in the blue}} room he escaped to the Garden of Spices--and he was shut in very often, for, Mr. Burroughs being away, he got into {{a good deal of}} what Aunt Augusta called mischief. Besides, it is a sad truth that Jims didn't <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to be good now. He thought it paid better to be bad and be shut up. To be sure there was always a fly in the ointment. He was haunted by a vague fear that Aunt Augusta might relent and come to the blue room before supper time to let him out.|$|E

60|$|He arose as {{sharply from}} the chair, and, without a word, {{went to the}} sink. It was a greasy, filthy sink. A smell came up from the outlet. He took no notice of it. That a sink should smell was to him {{part of the natural}} order, just as it {{was a part of the}} natural order that the soap should be grimy with dish-water and hard to lather. Nor did he <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to make it lather. Several {{splashes}} of the cold water from the running faucet completed the function. He did not wash his teeth. For that matter he had never seen a toothbrush, nor did he know that there existed beings in the world who were guilty of so great a foolishness as tooth washing.|$|E
60|$|I {{do not say}} the {{experience}} was so explicit as all this; no experience so mystical could be so explicit; and perhaps what was intimated to me in it was only that if I sometime meant to ask some gentle reader's company in a retrospect of my Spanish travels, I had better be honest with him and own at the beginning that passion for Spanish things which was the ruling passion of my boyhood; I had better confess that, however unrequited, it held me in the eager bondage of a lover still, so that I never wished to escape from it, but must try {{to hide the fact}} whenever the real Spain fell below the ideal, however I might reason with my infatuation or try to scoff it away. It had once been so inextinguishable {{a part of me that}} the record of my journey must be more or less autobiographical; and though I should decently endeavor to keep my past out of it, perhaps I should not <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> and should not always succeed.|$|E

Do you know, Robert, this news has been quite a relief to me? I should always have felt that the wealth was a burden; and now that I am punished for my fault, I shall not reproach myself quite so much with it. But I am sorry for your sake, dear. It must be a great blow for you, and I feel how kind it is of you to hide your disappointment for my sake. I will <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> Robert, to make it up to you by loving you more and more; and you shall see what a useful little wife I will make you as soon as I get strong again, which I mean to do very fast now." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{believe they}} are as happy as it is {{possible}} for a couple to be. Polly says it would be quite perfect if she only had me with them. Charley and she tried very hard to persuade me, but I was firm in my resolution. Canterbury is my home, and shall always remain so; but when my spirits get better I shall make my visits longer in London; but not till I feel that my dull presence is no drawback to the brightness of their hearth: and this will not be for a long time yet. I <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to be patient, but I feel at times irritable and impatient at my sorrow, I hope, with time, that this will die away, and that I shall settle down into a tranquil, even-tempered, cheerful old maid. I find it difficult, at present, to enter into all the tittle-tattle and gossip of this town, but I endeavour to do so, for I know that I shall not be the same as those around me if I do not. So I am beginning to join in the working parties and tea-meetings, which form the staple of the amusements of our quiet set, and where we discuss the affairs of Canterbury to our hearts' content. And now I lay down my pen, which has already run on far beyond the limits I had originally assigned for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very happy}} indeed, Mr. Vanderley," [...] she said, with the pretty dimpled smile which had so {{frequently}} shown {{itself in the}} course of our conversation, [...] "that you have given me this position. I am sure that I shall like it, and I shall <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to make my work satisfactory. I shall come up every morning in the nine o'clock train, as you desire; and I shall be obliged to bring my husband with me, but this will not in any way interfere with my work. He is suffering from a malarial disease, and is subject to periods of faintness, so that it would be impossible for me to leave him for the whole morning; but he can sit outside anywhere, under a tree, or perhaps somewhere in the house if it happens to rain. He is perfectly contented if he has a comfortable place to sit in. He is not able to attend to any business, and as I now have to be the bread-winner I am most deeply grateful for this work which you have given me. I am sure that the little trip in and out of town will do him good, and as I shall buy commutation tickets it will not be expensive. He came with me this morning, and if you will excuse me I will bring him in and introduce him." [...] And without waiting for any remark from me she left the room, and shortly returned with the malarial subject. He was an extremely mild-mannered man, of light weight and sedate aspect. The few words in which he indicated his gratification with his wife's engagement suggested to me the need of sulphate of quinia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Withersteen, it's all simple enough," [...] said Judkins, earnestly. [...] "Now please listen--an' beggin' your pardon--jest turn thet deaf Mormon ear aside, an' {{let me talk}} clear an' plain in the other. I {{went around}} to the saloons an' the stores an' the loafin' places yesterday. All your riders are in. There's talk of a {{vigilance}} band organized to hunt down rustlers. They call themselves 'The Riders.' Thet's the report--thet's the reason given for your riders leavin' you. Strange thet only a few riders of other ranchers joined the band! An' Tull's man, Jerry Card--he's the leader. I seen him en' his hoss. He 'ain't been to Glaze. I'm not easy to fool on the looks of a hoss thet's traveled the sage. Tull an' Jerry didn't ride to Glaze!... Well, I met Blake en' Dorn, both good friends of mine, usually, {{as far as their}} Mormon lights will let 'em go. But these fellers couldn't fool me, an' they didn't <b>try</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard.</b> I asked them, straight out like a man, why they left you like thet. I didn't forget to mention how you nursed Blake's poor old mother when she was sick, an' how good you was to Dorn's kids. They looked ashamed, Miss Withersteen. An' they jest froze up--thet dark set look thet makes them strange an' different to me. But I could tell the difference between thet first natural twinge of conscience an' the later look of some secret thing. An' the difference I caught was thet they couldn't help themselves. They hadn't no say in the matter. They looked as if their bein' unfaithful to you was bein' faithful to a higher duty. An' there's the secret. Why it's as plain as--as sight of my gun here." ...|$|E
