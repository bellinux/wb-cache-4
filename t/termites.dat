5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, <b>termites</b> are placed into two groups: the lower <b>termites</b> and higher <b>termites.</b> The lower <b>termites</b> predominately feed on wood. As wood is {{difficult}} to digest, <b>termites</b> prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher <b>termites</b> consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower <b>termites</b> contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher <b>termites</b> only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Among all predators, ants are the {{greatest}} enemy to <b>termites.</b> Some ant genera are specialist predators of <b>termites.</b> For example, Megaponera is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. Paltothyreus tarsatus is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many <b>termites</b> as possible in its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants Eurhopalothrix heliscata uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. Tetramorium uelense is a specialised predator species that feeds on small <b>termites.</b> A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where <b>termites</b> are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. Centromyrmex and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the <b>termites</b> are preyed on by these ants. No evidence {{for any kind of}} relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including Acanthostichus, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Cylindromyrmex, Leptogenys, Odontomachus, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Rhytidoponera, Solenopsis and Wasmannia, also prey on <b>termites.</b> In contrast to all these ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, Dorylus ants rarely consume <b>termites.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ants and <b>termites</b> may {{compete with}} each other for nesting space. In particular, ants that prey on <b>termites</b> usually have a {{negative}} impact on arboreal nesting species.|$|E
50|$|Mastotermes darwiniensis, {{common names}} giant {{northern}} <b>termite</b> and Darwin <b>termite,</b> is a <b>termite</b> species {{found only in}} northern Australia. It is a very peculiar insect, the most primitive <b>termite</b> alive.|$|R
50|$|The Sentricon <b>Termite</b> Colony Elimination System is a {{subterranean}} <b>termite</b> {{pest control}} product developed and manufactured by Dow AgroSciences. It {{was introduced in}} 1995 as a <b>termite</b> baiting system and an alternative to liquid termiticide soil barriers. It eliminates {{all members of the}} <b>termite</b> colony, including those of the Formosan subterranean <b>termite</b> colonies.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{probably}} the most destructive of the dryland <b>termite</b> species in the western United States, while rhinotermitidae subterranean <b>termite</b> damage is more costly. The western subterranean <b>termite</b> (Reticulitermes hesperus) is considered to be the worst <b>termite</b> pest in California, with I. minor in second place.|$|R
5|$|Claims that <b>termites</b> emerged earlier {{have faced}} controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner {{indicated}} that the Mastotermitidae <b>termites</b> may {{go back to the}} Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first <b>termites</b> emerged during the Carboniferous. <b>Termites</b> are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus. The folded wings of the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina, arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1aand 2a, resemble those seen in Mastotermes, the only living insect with the same pattern. Krishna et al., though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as <b>termites</b> are in fact unrelated to <b>termites</b> and should be excluded from the Isoptera. <b>Termites</b> were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} soft cuticles, <b>termites</b> do not inhabit cool or cold habitats. There are three {{ecological}} groups of termites: dampwood, drywood and subterranean. Dampwood <b>termites</b> are {{found only in}} coniferous forests, and drywood <b>termites</b> are found in hardwood forests; subterranean <b>termites</b> live in widely diverse areas. One species in the drywood group is the West Indian drywood termite (Cryptotermes brevis), which is an invasive species in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} when <b>termites</b> {{encounter}} {{each other in}} foraging areas, some of the <b>termites</b> deliberately block passages to prevent other <b>termites</b> from entering. Dead <b>termites</b> from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to {{the isolation of the}} area and thus the need to construct new tunnels. Conflict between two competitors does not always occur. For example, though they might block each other's passages, colonies of Macrotermes bellicosus and Macrotermes subhyalinus are not always aggressive towards each other. Suicide cramming is known in Coptotermes formosanus. Since C.formosanus colonies may get into physical conflict, some <b>termites</b> squeeze tightly into foraging tunnels and die, successfully blocking the tunnel and ending all agonistic activities.|$|E
50|$|Nasutitermes walkeri, {{commonly}} known as the niggerhead <b>termite</b> or tree <b>termite,</b> is a species of arboreal <b>termite</b> found in eastern New South Wales and southeastern Queensland, Australia.|$|R
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVE: Subterranian <b>termite</b> is a structure-infesting <b>termite</b> that {{accounts}} for {{a significant proportion of}} the damage wherever it occurs. One sustainable control strategy that usually helps to reduce the damage of subterranean <b>termite</b> is the use of insecticides which are safe to the environment. Hence, bioefficacy study of diflubenzuron, an environ friendly, chitin synthesis inhibitor was evaluated against subterranean <b>termite.</b> METHODOLOGY: It was achieved by testing by testing the three different concentrations of diflubenzuron against subterranean <b>termite</b> as per IS 4873. RESULTS: Diflubenzuron was found to be effective against subterranean <b>termite.</b> CONCLUSION: From the results of this study, it has been found that diflubenzuron at 1 % concentration rate provided excellent control of <b>termite.</b> This is the first report on the use of diflubenzuron in the glue line to control the <b>termite...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The West Indian drywood <b>termite,</b> (Cryptotermes dudleyi), is {{a species}} of dry wood <b>termite</b> of the genus Cryptotermes. It is native to Indonesia, Java and exotic to Australia, Trinidad and Tobago and Sri Lanka. It is {{predominantly}} a house <b>termite</b> found in natural and man-made wooden structures. Thus, {{this is the most}} commonest and most devastating drywood pest <b>termite</b> found in the world. It is a larger <b>termite</b> species, with 4.55-7.15mm length in soldiers.|$|R
5|$|The {{damage caused}} by <b>termites</b> costs the southwestern United States {{approximately}} $1.5billion each year in wood structure damage, but {{the true cost of}} damage worldwide cannot be determined. Drywood <b>termites</b> are responsible for {{a large proportion of the}} {{damage caused by}} <b>termites.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of <b>termites,</b> various methods {{have been developed to}} track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. <b>Termites</b> collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the <b>termites</b> using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on <b>termites</b> in the field. <b>Termites</b> bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the <b>termites</b> living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the <b>termites.</b> Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most <b>termites</b> construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive <b>termites</b> of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did <b>termites</b> millions of years ago.|$|E
50|$|The Fungus-growing <b>termite,</b> (Odontotermes feae), {{also known}} as South Asian wood-destroying <b>termite,</b> is a small species of earth {{dwelling}} <b>termite</b> of the genus Odontotermes. It is native to India and Sri Lanka.|$|R

50|$|Coptotermes gestroi, the Asian {{subterranean}} <b>termite</b> {{is a small}} {{species of}} <b>termite</b> that lives underground. Both this species and the Formosan subterranean <b>termite,</b> (Coptotermes formosanus) are destructive pests native to Asia, but have spread {{to other parts of}} the world including the United States. In Asia, this species is known as the Philippine milk <b>termite.</b>|$|R
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} from 16S rRNA sequences has supported a hypothesis, originally suggested by Cleveland and colleagues in 1934, that these insects are most {{closely related to}} wood-eating cockroaches (genus Cryptocercus, the woodroach). This earlier conclusion had been based on the similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in the wood-eating cockroaches to those in certain species of <b>termites</b> regarded as living fossils. In the 1960s additional evidence supporting that hypothesis emerged when F.A. McKittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some <b>termites</b> and Cryptocercus nymphs. These similarities have led some authors to propose that <b>termites</b> be reclassified as a single family, the Termitidae, within the order Blattodea, which contains cockroaches. Other researchers advocate the more conservative measure of retaining the <b>termites</b> as the Termitoidae, an epifamily within the cockroach order, which preserves the classification of <b>termites</b> at family level and below.|$|E
5|$|Drywood <b>termites</b> {{thrive in}} warm climates, and human {{activities}} can {{enable them to}} invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers and ships. Colonies of <b>termites</b> have been seen thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions. Some <b>termites</b> are considered invasive species. Cryptotermes brevis, the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Few zoos hold <b>termites,</b> {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying <b>termites.</b> This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male <b>termites</b> left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} {{believed}} throughout Japan that hinoki heartwood has large <b>termite</b> resistance. However, {{it was shown}} here that <b>termite</b> resistance differed among families {{and that there are}} families with less <b>termite</b> resistance. Especially, the <b>termite</b> resistances of individual samples of Kitamorokata 2 and Isa 1 were as low as that of P. densiflora. It was suggested that for a reliable hinoki wood supply, more information about the <b>termite</b> resistance of hinoki families should be obtained.|$|R
50|$|<b>Termite</b> {{membrane}} barriers {{consist of}} elastomeric sealants adhered to a high-strength backing. When {{included in the}} building envelope, membrane barriers may act as waterproofing, air barrier, and vapor barrier, as well. Applications for <b>termite</b> membranes include on insulated concrete forms (ICF), under sill plates and flooring, and as window, door, and base flashings, among others. <b>Termite</b> membrane barriers are pesticide-free and act as a physical barrier to <b>termite</b> intrusion. Most <b>termite</b> membranes must be implemented during the construction process.|$|R
40|$|State {{of the art}} {{thermal imaging}} {{technology}} {{is being used to}} locate <b>termite</b> infestations in buildings and houses.

This technology gives homeowners visible proof of <b>termite</b> infestation and a record of how great the problem is. Owners can often be unaware of the extent of any <b>termite</b> problems in their homes and may be over-charged by operators who do not accurately identify the <b>termite</b> problems and subsequent treatment...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to Africa, <b>termites</b> are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America. In Australia, Indigenous Australians {{are aware that}} <b>termites</b> are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (geophagy) in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Researchers have suggested that <b>termites</b> are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture, as they are high in protein {{and can be used}} to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to causing damage to buildings, <b>termites</b> can also damage food crops. <b>Termites</b> may attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore fast-growing plants. Most attacks occur at harvest time; crops and trees are attacked {{during the dry}} season.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ant {{are known to}} capture <b>termites</b> {{to use as a}} fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, Formica nigra captures <b>termites,</b> and those who try to escape are {{immediately}} seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside the mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some <b>termites</b> and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes <b>termites</b> date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.|$|E

5|$|<b>Termites</b> {{are known}} to carry pollen and {{regularly}} visit flowers, so are regarded as potential pollinators {{for a number of}} flowering plants. One flower in particular, Rhizanthella gardneri, is regularly pollinated by foraging workers, and it is perhaps the only Orchidaceae flower in the world to be pollinated by <b>termites.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Termites</b> have a ten-segmented abdomen {{with two}} plates, the tergites and the sternites. The tenth {{abdominal}} segment has {{a pair of}} short cerci. There are ten tergites, of which nine are wide and one is elongated. The reproductive organs {{are similar to those}} in cockroaches but are more simplified. For example, the intromittent organ is not present in male alates, and the sperm is either immotile or aflagellate. However, Mastotermitidae <b>termites</b> have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other <b>termites,</b> Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor, a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Termites,</b> {{although}} {{sometimes called}} 'white ants', are not ants. They {{belong to the}} sub-order Isoptera within the order Blattodea. <b>Termites</b> are {{more closely related to}} cockroaches and mantids. <b>Termites</b> are eusocial, but differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution. Velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.|$|E
50|$|The {{domestic}} drywood <b>termite,</b> (Cryptotermes domesticus), is {{a species}} of dry wood <b>termite</b> of the genus Cryptotermes.
