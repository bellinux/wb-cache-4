A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E
5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process.

5|$|Since 1996, {{the status}} of the Ethiopian hare has beendata {{deficient}} on theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.

5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time.

40|$|Purpose: Total elbow {{arthroplasty}} (TEA) {{is still}} in its infancy as compared with other forms of arthro-plasty. TEA designs have evolved with experience, but comparatively little long-term outcome data is available. This article provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> linked, unlinked, and convertible total elbow arthroplasty. Material and Method: The designs of total elbow prostheses can be subdivided into three categories: unlinked, linked, and convertible. This article provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> linked, unlinked, and convertible total elbow arthroplasty. Results and Conclusion: By proper patient selection and by utilizing implant design advances, improve-ments in cementation techniques, a meticulous surgical technique, and appropriate postoperative rehabili-tation, total elbow arthroplasty can provide a high level of patient satisfaction and pain relief...|$|R

5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> humans.|$|E

5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Glover's pika {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it occurs in remote areas of China which are unlikely to be affected by human activities. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> its population trend is unclear, as no natural historic or ecological investigation has been done on this species. However, being locally poisoned and trapped is a major threat to the Glover's pika populations. It is also regionally red listed as a species of least concern in China.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Yunnan hare {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it has been reported by residents to be commonly found. Although <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> its population trend is unclear, the Yunnan hare population is likely to be secure as it occurs in remote areas in southwestern China. However, agricultural activities on mountainous regions may pose a threat to the species by isolating its mountain populations. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, nearly meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. It occurs in protected areas and also in the Changshanerhai, Daweishan, Gaoligongshan, Jinpingfenshuiling, Nujiang, Shilin, and Tongbiguan Nature Reserves.|$|E

5|$|Since June 2009, {{when two}} Red Line trains {{collided}} and killed nine people {{due in part}} to malfunctions in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been manually operated. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> manual operation has led to heavily degraded service, with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks, speed restrictions, and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains, increased dwell time, and worse on-time performance.
