500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.5/10, writing [...] "This wasn't {{just a good}} episode – it was great. It {{capitalized}} on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably {{going to want to}} tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> it up".|$|E
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on to say that this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|Talks {{about the}} 2014 NBA draft began awkwardly when Paul Stauskas told Sports Illustrated about his son, Nik: [...] "He knows {{all he has}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> his nose to the {{grindstone}} for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go pro." [...] Several days later Stauskas tried to distance himself from his father's statement, apologizing to his fans. After the season Stauskas, Robinson and McGary said that they were considering entering the draft, but had not made a decision. Each submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, which was required to respond by April 14 (giving the players until April 27 to declare their eligibility). On April 10 it was reported that Stauskas had decided to turn pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein (father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr.) as his agent. In an April 15 joint press conference on the Big Ten Network, Robinson and Stauskas announced that they were declaring their eligibility for the NBA draft. When he learned that he had tested positive for marijuana after the Sweet Sixteen victory over Tennessee and was facing a one-year suspension, McGary also entered the draft.|$|E

500|$|Discussion {{about him}} {{entering}} the 2014 NBA draft {{began when he}} got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated, [...] "He knows all he has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go Pro." [...] However, a few days later, Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his father's statements and apologized to his fans. Following the season, Stauskas, who was regarded as a likely late first round selection, said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family. On April 6, Stauskas said he would make his decision within the next week or so. On April 7, David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards (ahead of Harris, James Young, and Andrew Harrison) and a late lottery selection. Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection. Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. On April 10, reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent. Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network, Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein (along with teammate McGary). On May 5, Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.|$|E

50|$|This {{reviewer}} wishes {{him good}} luck with that and hopes that he never, ever gets the itch to write another book. Define Conservatism is terrible. It's not simply that the book is riddled with typos (though it is) or that it's shallow and awkwardly phrased that annoys so.

This can be done in confined spaces or dangling in mid-air if need be, and is a common way to manage caving ropes without introducing troublesome twist.|$|E

5000|$|Audio, Video, Disco. is {{the second}} studio album by the French {{electronic}} music duo Justice, released on 24 October 2011 by Ed Banger Records, Because Music and Elektra Records.

What we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>keep</b> the beats, but make it more soft. One of the challenges of this record was to make it feel emotionally heavy without being aggressive. Like being soft and violent at the same time. The texture of the new record is really soft." [...] The album also features more collaborations than on the band's debut album †.|$|R

5000|$|Primary mode - {{the gun is}} {{elevated}} 3 degrees {{above the}} line of sight {{to reduce the amount}} of dust generated by the missile launch. This is critical since the tank has to see both the target and the light source on the rear of the missile in order to be able to guide the missile to the target. The missile system uses SACLOS guidance, all the gunner has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> the crosshairs centered on the target and the 1A33 fire control system generates course corrections, which are broadcast to the missile. Accuracy at 4000 m is estimated to be about 80% in this mode.|$|E
5000|$|García {{worked with}} Democratic State Senator Dwight Bullard to {{continue}} subsidizing private tutoring companies in Florida, {{an effort that}} ultimately failed. Speaking in defense of their proposal, García asserted, [...] "What we're trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> it in law that the students {{have the option of}} tutoring services, both public and private. At the end of the day, the ones who benefit from this are minority students." [...] García also joined Democrats in the Senate to defeat the controversial [...] "parent trigger" [...] legislation, which [...] "would have allowed parents with students at F-rated schools to petition their school board to select one of the state's mandated turnaround options--which include converting it to a charter school." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the missile}} is fired, all the gunner has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> the {{target in the}} sight's cross hairs, and the system will {{automatically}} track the missile's rear-facing flares, gather the missile into the gunner's sight, and send commands to steer the missile into the gunner's line of sight. Approximately 50 meters after ejecting from the container, the safety system arms the HEAT warhead's fuze and will detonate when the outer skin of the two-layer nose cone is crushed to contact with the inside skin, completing an electrical circuit. With this type of fuzing system, the missile {{does not have to}} hit the tip of the missile's nose to detonate the HEAT warhead. [...] The HOT 1 and HOT 2 use the warhead fuzing system previously described.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the KingCobra {{was to be}} the new wire-guided BGM-71 TOW {{anti-tank}} missile, which had proven highly effective in combat test firings in Vietnam from Huey gunships. This weapon could be carried in a pack of four missiles, with one pack under each stub wing for a total of eight missiles. On launch, the TOW trailed out wires to communicate command guidance updates. The missile had two infrared flares on its tail to allow the SMS to track it. All the gunner had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>keep</b> the target in his sight, and the missile fire control system adjusted its flight appropriately. Both the gunner and the pilot had Sperry Univac helmet-mounted sights to allow them to acquire targets for the KingCobra's missiles and gun.|$|R
