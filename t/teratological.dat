5|$|It is {{plausible}} that ceratosaurians underwent BDR {{independent of the}} tetanurans, and therefore has no bearing {{on the issue of}} avian digit homology. In particular, as demonstrated by <b>teratological</b> analysis, the abbreviation (mesomelia) and loss of digits (hypophalangia) in the forelimb of Limusaurus is likely the result of a developmental anomaly that appeared exclusively in and persisted throughout the evolutionary lineage of ceratosaurians, and is unconnected to the pattern of digital reduction and frameshift that occurred in tetanurans. This is supported by the hands of the ceratosaurians Ceratosaurus, Berberosaurus, and Eoabelisaurus having plesiomorphic (i.e. more similar to the ancestral condition of theropods than to derived abelisaurs) metacarpal bones comparable to those of the more basal theropod Dilophosaurus. The divergent developmental pathways of ceratosaurians and tetanurans is associated with a difference in forelimb function; tetanurans utilized their hands for grasping, while the hands of ceratosaurians almost certainly played no role in predation.|$|E
25|$|In East Germany, {{the head}} of the central {{pharmacy}} control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid. Meanwhile, in West Germany, it took some time before the increase in dysmelia {{at the end of the}} 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958 Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in Bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children. Based on this, FDP whip Erich Mende requested an official statement from the federal government. For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide. After the Nazi regime with its Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes, western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way. The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia. Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful. The project was led by pathologist Franz Büchner who ran the project to propagate his <b>teratological</b> theory. Büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons. Furthermore, it took a while to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the Federal Ministry of Health (Germany) was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market. In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born.|$|E

6000|$|This law {{seems to}} imply that {{homologous}} parts actually attract one another and then unite. No doubt there are many wonderful cases, in which such parts become intimately fused together. This is perhaps best seen in monsters with two heads, which are united, summit to summit, or face to face, or Janus-like, back to back, or obliquely side to side. In one instance of two heads united almost face to face, but a little obliquely, four ears were developed, and on one side a perfect face, which was manifestly formed by the fusion of two half-faces. Whenever two bodies or two heads are united, each bone, muscle, vessel, and nerve on the line of junction appears {{as if it had}} sought out its fellow, and had become completely fused with it. Lereboullet (26/2. 'Comptes Rendus' 1855 pages 855, 1039.), who carefully studied the development of double monsters in fishes, observed in fifteen instances the steps by which two heads gradually became united into one. In all such cases it is now thought by the greater number of capable judges that the homologous parts do not attract each other, but that in the words of Mr. Lowne (26/3. 'Catalogue of the <b>Teratological</b> Series in the Museum of the R. Coll. of Surgeons' 1872 page 16.): [...] "As union takes place before the differentiation of distinct organs occurs, these are formed in continuity with each other." [...] He adds that organs already differentiated probably in no case become united to homologous ones. M. Dareste does not speak (26/4. 'Archives de Zoolog. Exper.' January 1874 page 78.) quite decisively against the law of soi pour soi, but concludes by saying, [...] "On se rend parfaitement compte de la formation des monstres, si l'on admet que les embryons qui se soudent appartiennent a un meme oeuf; qu'ils s'unissent en meme temps qu'ils se forment, et que la soudure ne se produit que pendant la premiere periode de la vie embryonnaire, celle ou les organes ne sont encore constitues que par des blastemes homogenes." ...|$|E

50|$|Willem Vrolik {{published}} <b>teratological</b> {{works on}} cyclopia, {{the pathogenesis of}} congenital anomalies, and a treatise on conjoined twins. In the 1840s he published Handboek der ziektekundige ontleedkunde (Handbook of pathological anatomy), as well as Tabulae ad illustrandam embryogenesin hominis et mammalium tam naturalem quam abnormem. The latter book contained numerous illustrative plates on the embryogenesis of vertebrates, including congenital anomalies of various species, including man. In 1850, the book won the Prix Montyon from the French Academy of Sciences.

50|$|Studies {{designed}} {{to test the}} teratogenic potential of environmental agents use animal model systems (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey). Early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to environmental agents and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities. While this is still part of the <b>teratological</b> evaluation procedures today, the field of Teratology is moving to a more molecular level, seeking the mechanism(s) of action by which these agents act. Genetically modified mice are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, pregnancy registries are large, prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births. These studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its libraries, UvA has five museums.

50|$|Presently, {{the only}} <b>teratological</b> effect {{observed}} in humans following nuclear attacks on highly populated areas is microcephaly {{which is the}} only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the in utero developing human fetuses present during the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Of all the pregnant women who were close enough to be exposed to the prompt burst of intense neutron and gamma doses in the two cities, the total number of children born with microcephaly was below 50. No statistically demonstrable increase of congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who could conceive and were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities than the Japanese average.|$|E

50|$|Šumma izbu, “If a reject (= {{anomalous}} birth)” is {{an ancient}} Mesopotamian compendium of around 2,000 <b>teratological</b> omens, on 24 tablets probably formed from three separate earlier series on odd human births, šumma sinništu arâtma, “if a woman is pregnant” (tablets 1-4), the šumma izbu proper, on physically malformed births (tablets 6-17), and anomalous animal births: goats (tablet 18), cattle and donkeys (tablet 19), horses (tablets 20-21), pigs (tablet 22), dogs (tablet 23), wild animals (tablet 24), lambs (tablet 5, possibly the oldest in the series) and sheep (distributed across tablets 18-24).

50|$|Early in Holson's career, {{while at}} NCTR, he led studies that {{assessed}} the developmental toxicity of FD&C Red No. 2, an amaranth dye, and the herbicide, 2,4,5‐T (a component of Agent Orange). The FD&C Red No. 2 {{study was a}} multi-laboratory collaborative effort between industry, U.S. FDA, and NCTR, while the 2,4,5-T study was a large-scale multireplicated study in various strains/stocks of mice that included replicated test groups, at least four dose levels per replicate, use of multiple stocks/strains of animals to obtain {{an estimate of the}} range in sensitivities due to genotype, complete maternal pathology, and fetal histopathology and <b>teratological</b> evaluation. In a follow-up statistical analysis of these data, it was calculated that 805 litters per dose group would be necessary to detect a 5% increase in embryo resorption, suggesting that no standard regulatory study is adequately capable of evaluating the dose-response threshold at low response rates. Based on these results, Holson recommended that U.S. FDA include a similar approach to standardize the statistical resolving power of tests relative to known interlaboratory and interspecies endpoint variability and variances.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the field}} of zoology, the Muséum d'Angers has {{collections}} of entomology ( [...] specimens), malacology ( [...] specimens), ornithology ( [...] , including oology and nestology), mammalogy ( [...] specimens), herpetology ( [...] specimens), ichthyology ( [...] specimens) and marine invertebrates ( [...] specimens). Apart from taxidermy specimens, there are osteological specimens, <b>teratological</b> specimens, specimens in liquid, casts, models etc. Of special interest is {{the reconstruction of the}} cabinet of the Angevin entomologist Gustave Abot (1843-1926), specialist on beetles of Maine-et-Loire. The Muséum d'Angers houses the reference collection of spiders of Maine-et-Loire. It also retains the Servain and Surrault collections (freshwater malacology), which together with the Letourneux collection (world malacology) form a remarkable ensemble. With the Boursicot legacy in 1999, the zoology collections gained tens of thousands of specimens, especially insects and shells. In addition, the ornithological collections are particularly rich, with eggs, nests and taxidermy of all of the birds of Maine-et-Loire. There are also specimens belonging to extinct species, including a Carolina parakeet and a migratory pigeon; casts of Æpyornis egg and a moa's leg can be seen. There are also historical specimens, including one of the last sturgeons fished in the Loire in 1811, and cetacean bones of the same period. Among the last remarkable acquisitions, the arrival of an okapi (accompanied by its skeleton) is noteworthy.|$|E

Changes in gene expression and induction of apoptosis in embryos exposed to a dia-betic environment have been investigated and assigned roles in the teratogenic pro-cesses. The diabetic environment appears to simultaneously induce alterations in several interrelated <b>teratological</b> pathways.
