40|$|The thesis writer {{discusses}} the main female implementation of her unconventional ideas on sex and marriage in <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison?s</b> Sula. The thesis writer wonders what makes Sula, the main female character has unconventional ideas on sex and marriage, {{and how the}} ideas are implemented in her attitude in the novel. The thesis writer wants to reveal the reason why Sula has unconventional ideas on sex and marriage, and the ways Sula implemented in her attitude. Utilizing the literary approach, the thesis writer analyzes <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison?s</b> Sula by applying literary tools such as characterization, setting, and conflict. Besides, he needs the definition of friendship as the supporting tool to analyze the relationship between Sula as the main female character with Nel. The analysis shows that {{in the process of}} implementation ideas on sex and marriage, the main female character undergoes conflicts, until she becomes a new young woman with a new character. The implementation of unconventional ideas on sex and marriage experienced by Sula is for the better of everything. Undoubtedly the implementation of unconventional ideas on sex and marriage eventually makes the main female character become stronger, better and wiser after she has conflicting idea with Nel concerning the unconventional ideas of sex and marriage...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the cities of}} Virginia Woolfs Mrs. Dalloway and <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison???s</b> Jazz {{in light of the}} ecocritical implications of new cognitive theories about the interactions between humans and environment. Woolf and Morrison utilize experimental narrative techniques to explore the effects of urban modernity on the movements and perceptions of their characters and the place of rural memory in the perceived city environment. Both these novels are particularly evocative in their portrayals of the challenges of modernity to human consciousness and of increasingly urban and mechanized environments to the human mind...|$|R

The books, both published in 1970, portray the lives of young girls as they learn {{what it is to be}} black under a solid racist regime that dictates white western society as the norm. The norm includes, necessarily, physical traits that are established as the standards for beauty. African-American girls need to deal with these standards in their self-perception and identities. The study intends to demonstrate that families play a significant role in this process of self-perception and may encourage either the acceptance of these standards or their rejection...|$|R

40|$|Recasting {{the role}} of the overshadowed African American in American literature, <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison???s</b> Song of Solomon {{positions}} her Black characters as visible, agential protagonists inhabiting the urban North, untethering their ties to a master-slave narrative indicative of the South. Yet, every White encounter in the text, often seen through the perspective of Black characters and voiced by Black characters, renders the African American subservient and disposable. Such is the literary manifestation of Michel Foucault???s circular elimination, which posits the perpetual incarceration of Black bodies {{as a result of an}} inescapable plantation ethic???an ethic which inexorably reduces the African American to subhuman. Does the African American remain subservient and demonized even in a text where Whiteness is purposefully pushed to the margins and Blackness given center stage? I argue that Black agency is not fully supplanted in Song of Solomon. Rather, it is regained through the African American???s control over language and metaphor, a power exhibited by Morrison???s characters and Morrison, herself, as narrator. Morrison recaptures the medium of language???a medium once used by her White authorial predecessors to subliminally demonize the African American???to reconfigure Black identity in the literary imagination. I will apply Morrison???s model of rereading as unearthing subliminal racism, taken from her treatise Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination, to reveal an inescapable incarceration of Black identity even in a Black-authored text. Concurrently, I will highlight the ways in which Morrison unbinds herself and her black characters through linguistic and metaphorical resistance...|$|R
5000|$|Sal Cinquemani noted her {{popularity}} had eclipsed Michael Jacksons, [...] "as {{she would}} continue to do {{for more than a}} decade." [...] Music scholars John Shepherd and David Horn wrote that as a crossover artist on the pop and R&B charts, she emerged [...] "the most dominant female performer of the 1980s" [...] behind Whitney Houston. Dan Rubey observed that she presented herself as a role model for black women and as a creative intellect whose work advocated the advancement of black people. Joseph Vogel stated that her rising popularity {{towards the end of the}} decade was important for several reasons, [...] "not the least of which was how it coincided with (and spoke to) the rise of black feminism." [...] At a time when radio airplay and MTV primarily catered to white rock musicians, her album and its predecessor garnered widespread critical acclaim alongside other [...] "unprecedented breakthroughs" [...] by black womenâ€”including Alice Walkers The Color Purple (1982), <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrisons</b> Beloved (1987) and Patricia Hill Collinss Black Feminist Thought (1990)â€”musically capturing the spirit of the movement and presenting an alternate model on both womanhood and feminism to that of Madonna. Regarding her diverse appeal among youth, he also stated: [...] "Janet didnt have the vocal prowess of Whitney Houston, or the poetic subtlety of Kate Bush; she didnt have Annie Lennoxs penchant for the avant-garde or Madonnas predilection for shock. But none of these artists achieved the cross-racial impact (particularly on youth culture) of Janet. And none of them had an album like Rhythm Nation 1814." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison???s</b> novel Beloved, {{written in}} 1987, is a {{response}} to previous slave narratives {{as a result of a}} change in historiography stemming from the Black Power movement of the previous two decades. In this neo-slave narrative, Morrison attempts to fill in the gaps that historical writings have left out and give a voice to those left silenced by the horrific traumatic experiences of slavery. I will focus on the function of trauma, narrative, and ghosts in the novel and more specifically on five main aspects of her response to slavery. Using Judith Herman???s definition of trauma from Trauma and Recovery, and Nathan Irving Huggins book The Black Odyssey I will illustrate the horrific conditions of slavery, and the traumatic effects on the individual, family, and on subsequent generations, including PTSD. I will then address the affects one ???Sweet Home Man???, Paul D, has on the trauma residing in the house and then on the memories of Sethe, the protagonist, and Denver, her daughter. The next section will focus on Mourning and Melancholy using Sigmund Freud???s theory on the latency of trauma, followed by how the novel, as well as the bodies of the characters, function as crypts and how the novel itself is a tool being used by Morrison to dig up the dead stories and subsequently, give them a proper reburial through the memorialization of the text, including an examination of the function of the ghosts that consequently arise. In conclusion, I will highlight how the novel resembles a palimpsest and responds to previous narratives, further layering the stories of slavery, and how Morrison expertly provides an invitation for healing within the community in the book and the community of readers as well...|$|R
25|$|The novel Song of Solomon follows Milkmanâ€™s {{life from}} his birth to his leap towards his friend Guitar. <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison</b> conjoins and mixes in her novel present and past from the {{perspectives}} of different personages. The narrator not only observes the situations, taking place in the novel, but also looks into the inner life of the novel personages.

500|$|Clinton drew {{strong support}} from the African American {{community}} and insisted that the improvement of race relations {{would be a major}} theme of his presidency. In 1998, Nobel laureate <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison</b> called Clinton [...] "the first Black president", saying, [...] "Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas". Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that blacks typically endure. Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging to both Clinton and the African-American community at large. Clinton, a Baptist, has been open about his faith.|$|E
500|$|Examples include Nobel laureate <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison,</b> {{who used}} {{the myth of the}} flying Africans in her novel, Song of Solomon, and Alex Haley, who retells the story in his book Roots.

They are retold from the context of the Gullah descendants in the feature film Daughters of the Dust (1993), directed by Julie Dash. Other contemporary artists that allude to, or have integrated the complete tale of the Flying Africans in their work include Joseph Zobel, Maryse Conde, Toni Cade Bambara and Jamaica Kincaid.

500|$|Additionally, {{the novel}} drew from {{prevalent}} assumptions {{during the time}} that dark-skinned people were somehow inherently inferior. One critic of the use of race in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket is <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison.</b> In [...] "Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination," [...] Morrison discusses how the Africanist presence in the novel is used as an [...] "Other" [...] against which the author defines [...] "white," [...] "free," [...] and [...] "individual". In her explorations of the depiction of African characters in white American literature, Morrison writes that [...] "no early American writer is more important to the concept of American Africanism than Poe" [...] because of the focus on the symbolism of black and white in Poe's novel. This possible racial symbolism is explored further in Mat Johnson's satirical fantasy Pym (2011).|$|E
500|$|Achebe {{provided}} a [...] "blueprint" [...] for African writers of succeeding generations. In 1982, {{he was awarded}} an honorary degree from the University of Kent.

[...] Even outside of Africa, his impact resonates strongly in literary circles. Novelist Margaret Atwood called him [...] "a magical writerâ€“ one of the greatest of the twentieth century". Poet Maya Angelou lauded Things Fall Apart as a book wherein [...] "all readers meet their brothers, sisters, parents and friends and themselves along Nigerian roads". Nelson Mandela, recalling his time as a political prisoner, once referred to Achebe as a writer [...] "in whose company the prison walls fell down", and that his work Things Fall Apart inspired him to continue the struggle to end apartheid. Nobel laureate <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison</b> has noted that Achebe's work inspired her to become a writer and [...] "sparked her love affair with African literature".|$|E
500|$|As feminist {{literary}} critic Susan Gubar argues, Mary Shelley's drama {{is part of}} a female literary tradition, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, H.D., <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison,</b> Margaret Atwood, and Doris Lessing, which has responded to the story of Ceres and Proserpine. These writers use the myth as a [...] "way of dealing with their experience of themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood....they use the myth of Demeter and Persephone to re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself." [...] Poets such as Dorothy Wellesley, Rachel Annand Taylor, Babette Deutsch, and Helen Wolfert as well as Mary Shelley portray the procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge [...] "the divisions between self and other" [...] that rest at the centre of patriarchy. Feminist poet Adrienne Rich writes that [...] "the loss of the daughter to the mother, the mother to the daughter, is the essential female tragedy", and it is this tragedy that Mary Shelley discusses in her play.|$|E
500|$|URBs Dan Vidal {{called the}} album [...] "a {{spectrum}} of sound â€” packed and arranged perfectly into a masterfully composed (debut) full-length body of work... genre-defying masterpiece". Comparing it to singer Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), Brentin Mock of The Atlantic called The ArchAndroid [...] "a smothered funk, though perhaps at times too thick, too inaccessible, {{but not so}} much I didn't want to shake my ass" [...] and viewed it as musically progressive, stating [...] "MonÃ¡e has given pop music its first <b>Toni</b> <b>Morrison</b> moment, where fantasy, funk, and the ancestors come together for an experience that evolves one's soul... You really don't know whether you want to diagram it, dance to it, or just be dumbstruck. It owes as much to Parliament-Funkadelic as it does to Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler. She is finally doing what a number of artistsâ€”particularly black artistsâ€”have not been able to do in years, and that's move pop music forward". Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Barnes & Noble Review, deeming it [...] "the most overrated album of the year" [...] while writing that MonÃ¡e's [...] "songwriting is 60th percentile, her singing technical, her sci-fi plot the usual rot".|$|E
