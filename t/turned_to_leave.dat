2500|$|On March 31, Selena woke {{up early}} to meet Saldivar {{at the motel}} where she was staying. She met with Saldivar, who delayed the {{transfer}} of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors {{found no evidence of}} rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> Saldivar reached into her handbag, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 [...]38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. She ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour.|$|E
2500|$|Guiteau put {{his pistol}} {{back in his}} pocket and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> via a cab that he had waiting for him outside the station, but {{collided}} with policeman Patrick Kearney, who was entering the station after hearing the gunfire. Kearney apprehended Guiteau. He was so excited at having arrested the man who had presumably shot Garfield that he neglected to take Guiteau's gun from him until after their arrival at the police station. Kearney demanded, [...] "In God's name, what did you shoot the president for?" [...] Guiteau did not respond. The rapidly gathering crowd screamed, [...] "Lynch him!", but Kearney and several other police officers took the assassin to the police station a few blocks away. As he surrendered to authorities, Guiteau uttered the exulting words, repeated everywhere: [...] "'I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts! I did it and I want to be arrested! Arthur is President now!'" [...] This statement briefly led to unfounded suspicions that either Arthur or his supporters had put Guiteau up to the crime. The Stalwarts were a Republican faction loyal to former President Grant; they strongly opposed Garfield's Half-Breeds. Like many other vice presidents, Chester A. Arthur had been selected as a running mate for political advantage — to placate his faction rather than for his skills or loyalty. Guiteau, in his delusion, had convinced himself that he was striking a blow to unite the two factions of the Republican Party.|$|E
