5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> this perception at the very end.|$|E
5|$|The moons {{discovered}} by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are {{among the largest}} satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors {{at the same point}} in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> his own life.|$|E

She was then bred to the Darley stallion Hard Spun, producing a colt on March 1, 2014. In March 2016 she was confirmed in foal to 2015 Triple Crown Champion, American Pharaoh.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{marriage}} to Claude Duchess of Brittany, Francis I of France secured the Union of Brittany and France. On 13 August 1532, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the arrangement by signing the Edict of Union. Upon the death of Francis III, Duke of Brittany in 1536, the Duchy of Brittany passed to Henry II of France. Henry's status as king of France meant that the duchy became merely a French province. Institutions such as the Breton Estates and Parlement of Brittany continued to resist Paris in matters of taxation until their dissolution {{at the end of}} the 18th century. Breton nationalism saw a revival following the 1839 publication of Barzaz Breiz, a collection of traditional Breton folktales, songs and music. Pitre-Chevalier's 1844 Histoire de la Bretagne, followed in the same footsteps by highlighting a number of historical events as manifestations of Breton nationalism and aspirations of independence. Chevalier did not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> the causes of revolts such as the Revolt of the papier timbré, in order to promote his agenda. The end of the 19th century was marked by the disintegration of archaic Breton social and economic structures with a parallel drive for compulsory primary education. During the course of the latter, primary teachers were specifically instructed with phasing out minority languages. Early Breton nationalist organizations such as Association Brettone (founded in 1829) focused on issues such as the preservation of the Breton language and administrative autonomy. By 1914, the Breton language had embraced by the region's intellectuals through a literary revival failing however to reach the masses.|$|E
5|$|However, {{their efforts}} {{result in the}} {{destruction}} of the ship, and Reala uses the energy of the Lens to send them through time again. They appear in an alternate timeline where the War of Heaven and Earth was won by the underground dwellers, and Barbatos and Elrane are hailed as saviors. Traveling back to the time of the War, when the initial interference was caused, they ally with Harold Belselius to return history to its proper state. While they are successful and Barbatos is felled, Elrane continues <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> history in her favor. Confronting her one last time, she is defeated, then they are confronted by Fortuna. Defeating her, the group realize {{that the only way to}} correct the distorted timeline is to destroy the Lens that forms Fortuna's life source, which will mean Reala will be erased from history. When Reala comes to terms with this and gives her blessing, Kyle destroys Fortuna's Lens, which erases all the changes wrought by her agents and returns the timeline to its original state, sending everyone back to their original times and conditions. In the corrected timeline, Kyle, now raised and trained by both Stahn and Rutee, goes on a journey to the temple where he first met Reala. While her Lens is missing, Kyle's strong will succeeds in bringing Reala back into existence and restoring his memories of her.|$|E

25|$|Competition law, {{known in}} the U.S. as {{antitrust}} law, is an evolving field that traces {{as far back as}} Roman decrees against price fixing and the English restraint of trade doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the Sherman Act and Clayton Act) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> market prices at the expense of consumer welfare.|$|E
25|$|This D {{shape is}} not ideal for a {{pressure}} drum though, as pressure will tend <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> {{it into a}} more circular section. This flexing led to leakage where the water tubes entered the drum; a problem, termed 'wrapperitis', which was shared with the White-Forster. Experience of boiler explosions had shown that sharp internal corners inside boilers were also prone to erosion by grooving. Later boilers used a more rounded section, although still asymmetrical rather than fully cylindrical.|$|E

More specifically, interference with an individual’s liberty is permissible only if, by interfering, we stand a reasonable chance of preventing that agent from performing actions she chose due <b>to</b> <b>distorted</b> reasoning and which would result in that agent’s rationally chosen ends not being as fully realized as they would have been had she so acted.

25|$|Post-Impressionism is {{the term}} coined by the British artist and art critic Roger Fry in 1910 to {{describe}} the development of French art since Manet. Fry used the term when he organized the 1910 exhibition Manet and Post-Impressionism. Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brush strokes, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.|$|E
25|$|Events of the {{insurgency}} of Tacfarinas, which persisted during the years 17 to 24, and of the Roman campaign against him, appear in the well-known Annals of the Roman historian Tacitus (c.55–c.117). Parallels have been drawn to a previous Roman campaign in Numidia against the Berber king Jugurtha (r. 118–105), recorded by the Roman historian Sallust. It has been long alleged that both historians allow ancient Roman political concerns <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> and obscure {{the reality of the}} Berber situation and the Berber leaders.|$|E

25|$|Geological {{evidence}} for ice ages comes in various forms, including rock scouring and scratching, glacial moraines, drumlins, valley cutting, and the deposition of till or tillites and glacial erratics. Successive glaciations tend <b>to</b> <b>distort</b> and erase the geological evidence, {{making it difficult}} to interpret. Furthermore, this evidence was difficult to date exactly; early theories assumed that the glacials were short compared to the long interglacials. The advent of sediment and ice cores revealed the true situation: glacials are long, interglacials short. It took some time for the current theory to be worked out.|$|E
