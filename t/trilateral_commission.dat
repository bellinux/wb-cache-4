5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations {{began in}} 1917 {{with a group}} of New York {{academics}} who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign policy of the United States in the interwar period. Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs. The <b>Trilateral</b> <b>Commission</b> was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The <b>Trilateral</b> <b>Commission</b> is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.|$|E
5|$|American {{televangelist}} Pat Robertson, {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, {{became the most}} prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history.

25|$|The Ministers {{recommended}} {{to their respective}} Chiefs of State and/or Government the convening of a summit-level meeting of the three countries. They also decided to further intensify dialogue at all levels, when needed, to organize meetings of top officials and experts responsible for issues of mutual interest. They agreed to hold regular meetings and dialogues on issues of common interest. They further agreed to establish a <b>Trilateral</b> Joint <b>Commission.</b> The Foreign Ministries will be the pivots of the <b>Trilateral</b> Joint <b>Commission</b> and the meetings will be co-chaired by the three Foreign Ministers.

50|$|In 1958 and 1959 McDougall {{represented}} Canada on the <b>trilateral</b> International Control <b>Commission</b> for Vietnam (the {{other members}} being India and Poland). Her rapport {{with these two}} countries served her well in her subsequent appointments. Between 1961 and 1963 she served as first secretary and later counselor at the Canadian High Commission in India. In 1968 she was appointed ambassador to Poland, becoming the second Canadian woman {{to serve as an}} ambassador. Her tenure in Warsaw coincided with a number of crises in the Middle East, including the Six Day War and crises in the Eastern Block, including the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.|$|R
5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, <b>Trilateral</b> <b>Commission)</b> of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E

500|$|Deus Ex {{takes place}} in an {{unspecified}} near future in an alternate history where popular real world conspiracy theories are true. These include speculations regarding black helicopters, vaccinations, and FEMA, as well as Area 51, the ECHELON network, Men in Black, chupacabras (in the form of [...] "greasels"), and grey aliens. Mysterious groups such as Majestic 12, the Illuminati, the Knights Templar, the Bilderberg Group, and the <b>Trilateral</b> <b>Commission</b> also either play a central part in the plot or are alluded to {{during the course of}} the game.|$|E
500|$|Viewing {{the history}} of the world as {{the history of}} warfare between secret societies, {{conspiracy}} theorists go further than Rothkopf, and other scholars who have studied the global power elite, by claiming that established upper-class families with [...] "old money" [...] who founded and finance the Bilderberg Group, Bohemian Club, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Rhodes Trust, Skull and Bones, <b>Trilateral</b> <b>Commission,</b> and similar think tanks and private clubs, are illuminated conspirators plotting to impose a totalitarian New World Order—the implementation of an authoritarian world government controlled by the United Nations and a global central bank, which maintains political power through the financialization of the economy, regulation and restriction of speech through the concentration of media ownership, mass surveillance, widespread use of state terrorism, and an all-encompassing propaganda that creates a cult of personality around a puppet world leader and ideologizes world government as the culmination of history's progress.|$|E
500|$|In the post-Cold War era, {{several factors}} {{contributed to a}} more {{favorable}} environment for UNPA proposals. A <b>Trilateral</b> <b>Commission</b> report notes that the shift from a world led by the two rival Soviet- and U.S.-led blocs meant a general diffusion of power. Growth of economic interdependence, proliferation of transnational actors, nationalism in weak states, spread of technology, and increasing numbers of issues (such as global environmental problems and {{weapons of mass destruction}} containment) that are both domestic and international generated stronger incentive to develop international cooperation than ever before. Democracy in general had spread; in 2003, Freedom House counted 121 electoral democracies, compared to 66 in 1987 and 30 in 1975 (although by the mid-2000s, the trend appeared to have stagnated). The rapidly integrating European Union, a unique supranational body whose European Parliament was gradually growing in power, provided an example to the world of how a multi-nation parliament can evolve and function. The World Trade Organization and similar organizations generated great concern as they seemed to be gaining more influence and control over trade disputes, yet were not accountable to the people; U.S. President Bill Clinton argued, [...] "We must insist that international trade organizations be open to public scrutiny instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism." [...] A [...] "new diplomacy" [...] seemed to be taking shape in which NGOs and governments cooperated to create new global institutions such as the International Criminal Court.

2500|$|The Illuminati is {{just one}} of many groups that he {{believed}} are working to [...] "turn America into an amoral, humanist country, ripe for merger into a one-world socialist state."

2500|$|Additionally, a study {{authorized}} by the <b>Trilateral</b> <b>Commission</b> in 1975 to examine the [...] "governability" [...] of American democracy found that [...] "the most notable new source of national power in 1970, as compared to 1950, was the national media," [...] suggesting also that there was [...] "considerable {{evidence to suggest that}} the development of television journalism contributed to the undermining of governmental authority." [...] Although this report was commissioned {{on the heels of the}} messy conflict of the war itself, the sentiment that the development of new journalistic media such as television supplanted governmental authority in attaining the support of the American public during the Vietnam War has been accepted and upheld by many scholars through present day.|$|E
