5|$|Musidora {{is based}} on , a poem by the Scottish poet and playwright James Thomson (best known today {{as the author of}} Rule, Britannia!). Summer was {{initially}} published in 1727 and was republished in an altered form in 1730 along with Thomson's Winter (1726), Spring (1728) and Autumn (1730) as <b>The</b> <b>Seasons.</b> Although the individual poems attracted little interest on their release, <b>The</b> <b>Seasons</b> proved critically and commercially successful once completed, and Thomson began to associate with important and influential London political and cultural figures. In June 1744 Thomson published a drastically revised version of <b>The</b> <b>Seasons,</b> which became extremely influential over the following century. Joseph Haydn wrote a major oratorio based on the poem, significant artists including Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner and Richard Westall painted scenes from it, and over 400 editions of <b>The</b> <b>Seasons</b> in a number of languages were published between 1744 and 1870.|$|E

5|$|Pandora Crowned by <b>the</b> <b>Seasons</b> is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing <b>the</b> <b>seasons</b> in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
