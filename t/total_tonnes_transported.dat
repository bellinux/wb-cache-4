30|$|Figure 3 shows {{a plot of}} {{transport}} efficiency elasticity and transport content elasticity against transport distance. Transport efficiency elasticity is smaller at short distances and become asymptotic beyond longer distances. Short distances influence transport efficiency less than long distances. Oppositely, transport content elasticity is bigger at short distances and become asymptotic beyond longer distances. Transport distances of 83 % of total vehicle kilometers, 72 % of <b>total</b> <b>tonne</b> kilometers, 97 % of <b>total</b> <b>tonnes</b> and 98 % of total operations, {{are in the range}} of 9 – 112 kilometers. In this range the implication is that even a small increase in transport distance of road freight transport can bring about an important increase in transport content.|$|R

40|$|The {{need to make}} {{transport}} {{more efficient}} {{in order to make}} it less dependent on fossil fuels, more sustainable and reduce GHG emissions is included in the guidelines of the European Union. One measure to achieve this objective has been for manufacturers to improve engine performance so as to reduce GHG emissions according to regulations EURO I to VI of commercial vehicles for the transport of goods by road. This has resulted in significant savings in the fuel bill for the transport sector; however, the choice of route remains an important element to improve efficiency. In order to make this decision it is important to take into account: Travel time / distance travelled / number of tolls en route. Layout of slopes / consumption / average speeds. Technical characteristics of vehicles / power / number of axles / <b>tonnes</b> <b>transported.</b> In line with these objectives, the 2011 INNPACTO program by the Ministry of Science and Innovation approved a project called "Simulation platform for the development of innovative solutions in freight transport through high capacity roads (INNOTRANSMER, 2011) ", with the aim of developing an electronic platform which enabled freight companies to assess the most efficient routes with different vehicles and tracks, in order to determine the transport configuration with the lowest consumption/cost per <b>tonne</b> <b>transported</b> in trucks, thus creating a new instrument to assess transport efficiency and GHG emissions for a certain trip...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of automotive transportation system with swap bodies {{in the business of}} agricultural primary production and the possibilities of its use. The Automotive transportation system can be the carrier system for several kinds of extensions because of its design. In this case, the investigated transport system in selected company uses the back of the bulk materials, tanks and bulk truck. It was the truck LIAZ 151 with hull CSAO for bulk materials, faecal tank ACF 041 and high-volume hull type for transport bulky feed. Operating and investment costs of the whole transport system, performance of each swap bodies and technical parameters were evaluated. The primary agricultural enterprise ZD Trhový Štěpánov, a. s. was also characterized. For this thesis were detected information by observing and processing time of each frame bodies. More information has been gathered from internal materials, such as a serious journal, time sheets, annual report and other enterprise data sources. In terms of economic costs, these costs have been identified - costs per km = 27, 91 CZK/km, costs per <b>tonne</b> <b>transported</b> = 52, 93 CZK/t and costs per tonne-km = 7, 46 CZK/tkm. Total operating costs amount is 702 243. 62 CZK. Another result of the investigation was determined consumption and annual use of individual bodies. For the bucket SCAO was found that the consumption is 0, 69 litres per <b>tonne</b> <b>transported</b> and annual use of individual bodies is 98 days. For feacal tank ACF 041 the consumption is 29. 1 liters per hectare applied of manure and Antal use of individual bodls is 98 days.

Desktop research, of markets and transport statistics, was combined with interviews held with shippers, consignees and logistics service suppliers, and revealed a number of barriers to rail transport.

The global airfreight market was buoyant; airfreight from/to the London area airports was consistently increasing and had reached an all-time high of 1.8  m <b>tonnes</b> <b>transported,</b> in 2010. However, airfreight volumes between the EU and London area airports were in decline.

30|$|This study {{highlights}} {{differences on}} transport content related to transport distances and gives managers {{an incentive to}} raise operating performance by reducing energy consumption, vehicle kilometers and yielding environmental benefits. Nevertheless, the results are clearly influenced by the definition of content and efficiency indicators. For transport content the kilometers appear in the numerator, while for transport efficiency the kilometers appear in the numerator and denominator. Therefore, transport content will be more influenced by distance given these definitions. Similarly, the results {{draw attention to the}} peripheral situation of Spain, and the international transport with less than 3 % of <b>total</b> <b>tonnes</b> produces 18 % of running kilometers and 28 % of tonne kilometers. Consequently, demand and supply determine distances and, in many cases, there are no possibilities to minimize transport distances.|$|R
