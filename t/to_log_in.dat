25|$|On Unix-like {{operating}} systems, {{the output}} of the command is slightly different from $USER because whoami outputs the username that the user is working under, whereas $USER outputs the username that was used <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>in.</b> For example, if the user logged in as John and su into root, whoami displays root and echo $USER displays John. This is because the su command does not invoke a login shell by default.|$|E

25|$|A {{common mistake}} of early FTP administrators was to permit a {{directory}} named /incoming that allows full {{read and write}} access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> {{and go to a}} location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.|$|E

For the next two months, the boys play the game for 21 hours a day, killing low-level boars in the game's forests to gain experience points. In the process, the boys become lazy, long-haired, obese and acne-ridden. The boys' characters grow so quickly that the Blizzard executives, who have also been monitoring the griefer, take notice.|$|E

500|$|Later that year, {{the private}} Yahoo! Mail account of Sarah Palin, Republican vice presidential {{candidate}} in the 2008 United States presidential election, was hacked by a 4chan user. This followed criticism of Palin and other politicians supposedly using private email accounts for governmental work. The hacker posted the account's password on /b/, and screenshots from within the account to Wikileaks. A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email {{to a friend of}} Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he forgot to blank out the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users attempted <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, in that most reports on the hack focused on 4chan, rather than Palin's violation of campaign law. One user commented, [...] "seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically." [...] The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the incident shortly after its occurrence. On September 20 it was revealed they were questioning David Kernell, the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell.|$|E

2500|$|Many social {{networking}} services, such as Facebook, provide the user {{with a choice}} of who can view their profile. This is supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information. Parents who want to access their child's MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents. By making their profile private, teens can select who may see their page, allowing only people added as [...] "friends" [...] to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parents. Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parents. To edit information on a certain {{social networking}} service account, the social networking sites require you <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> or provide a password. This is designed to prevent unauthorized users from adding, changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.|$|E

This feature was dubbed as [...] "Tour Reporter Pro", and it saw Diana Gualda cover her own benefit show. As the time came for Snow Patrol to play at the Isle of Wight Festival, a new feature of the tour reporter, dubbed [...] "Tour Reporter Lite" [...] was introduced.

2500|$|Some {{operating}} systems {{that were available}} {{at the same time}} as Windows 9x are either multi-user or have multiple user accounts with different access privileges, which allows important system files (such as the kernel image) to be immutable under most user accounts. In contrast, while Windows 95 and later {{operating systems}} offer the option of having profiles for multiple users, they have no concept of access privileges, making them roughly equivalent to a single-user, single-account operating system; this means that all processes can modify all files on the system that aren't open, in addition to being able to modify the boot sector and perform other low-level hard drive modifications. This enables viruses and other clandestinely installed software to integrate themselves with the operating system in a way that is difficult for ordinary users to detect or undo. The profile support in the Windows 9x family is meant for convenience only; unless some registry keys are modified, the system can be accessed by pressing [...] "Cancel" [...] at login, even if all profiles have a password. [...] Windows 95's default login dialog box also allows new user profiles to be created without having <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> first.|$|E
