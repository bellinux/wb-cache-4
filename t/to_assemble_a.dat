5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion.

5|$|Abu'l-Aswar {{is first}} {{recorded}} by the history of Matthew of Edessa in 1040, when the Armenian nobleman Abirat, who had become embroiled in the dispute between Gagik I's sons Ashot IV and Hovhannes-Smbat III, came to Dvin. Fearful of the latter's displeasure, Abirat with 12,000 horsemen sought Abu'l-Aswar's protection. Abu'l-Aswar initially welcomed Abirat {{and gave him a}} high position, but soon came to mistrust him, and had him killed, whereupon Abirat's lieutenant Sare departed for Ani with Abirat's supporters. Despite their kinship, {{at about the same time}} Abu'l-Aswar attacked David of Tashir. The Shaddadid army, numbering an impossible 150,000 according to Matthew of Edessa, captured much of Tashir, but David was able <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>a</b> broad alliance against Abu'l-Aswar.

5|$|Another Marcus {{contribution}} to the arts was his own work {{in the area of}} photography. Over the course of his adult life, Marcus took thousands of photographs, both of famous and anonymous subjects, which he turned over to granddaughter Allison V. Smith, a professional photographer, upon moving out of his Nonesuch Road home into a smaller residence in the late 1990s. Two years after his death, Smith began making digital scans of the photos and posting them to the sharing site Flickr; despite the fact that their authorship was not identified, within a year the photographs had drawn 10,000 views.

5|$|By 1809, the Napoleonic Wars {{were six}} years old and the British Royal Navy was {{dominant}} at sea. Blockaded in their home ports by British squadrons, French warships, merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and, as a result, the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France. These colonies were also closely blockaded themselves and, as a result, their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed, resulting in economic collapse, severe food shortages and social unrest. Messages warning of the deteriorating situation in the colonies had been sent {{during the summer of}} 1808, particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. In response supplies had been sent from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn. The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island, and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London, who had ordered Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>a</b> force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>a</b> small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E
5|$|Böcker later {{explained}} {{that the decision to}} focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>a</b> list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>a</b> squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed {{defenders}} Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about trimming the squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an improbable challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored the all-important second goal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the battle, the Spanish troops and local militia increased their pressure on Castellfollit's garrison. On 5 April, the Catalan miquelets, supported by five companies of dragoons and several peasants, defeated a party of French troops from Berga and Castellfollit, killing 60 soldiers and taking 200 prisoners. Noailles, then ill of rheumatism, ordered Lieutenant-general Saint-Sylvestre <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>a</b> supply convoy to relieve Castellfollit, which he put under an escort of 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. A corps of miquelets, Spanish dragoons and peasants led by Blai de Trinxeria attacked and defeated the convoy on 15 April. After that, the French garrisons of Castellfollit and Hostalric fell under an effective blockade. On 19 May, Saint-Sylvestre assembled an army of 8,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry and relieved Hostalric, but Castellfollit remained blockaded. Noailles and his second in command were not in good terms: if Saint-Sylvestre advocated for demolishing and abandoning both Hostalric and Castellfollit, Noailles was not willing to give ground.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{is brought}} to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to {{investigate}} a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues about the Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors. The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned. Shepard is given command of a new starship, the Normandy SR-2, piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI, and begins <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>a</b> team to stop the Collectors. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack.
