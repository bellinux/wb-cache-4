25|$|The custom in Québec {{was similar}} to the one in France until 1981. Women would {{traditionally}} go by their husbands' surname in daily life, but their maiden name remained <b>their</b> <b>legal</b> <b>name.</b> Since the passage of a 1981 provincial law intended to promote gender equality as outlined in the Québec Charter of Rights, no change may be made to a person's name without the authorization of the registrar of civil status or the authorization of the court. Newlyweds who wish to change their names upon marriage must therefore go through the same procedure as those changing their names for other reasons. The registrar of civil status may authorize a name change if: 1) the name the person generally uses does not correspond to the name on their birth certificate, 2) the name is of foreign origin or too difficult to pronounce or write in its original form, or 3) the name invites ridicule or has become infamous. This law does not make it legal for a woman to immediately change her name upon marriage, as marriage is not listed among the reasons for a name change.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{people have}} a non-Chinese name (typically English) in {{addition}} to their Chinese names. For example, the Taiwanese politician Soong Chu-yu is also known as [...] "James Soong". In Hong Kong, it is common to list the names all together, beginning with the English given name, moving on to the Chinese surname, and then ending with the Chinese given namefor example, Alex Fong Chung-Sun. Among American-born and other overseas Chinese it is common practice to be referred to primarily by one's non-Chinese name, with the Chinese one relegated to alternate or middle name status. Recent immigrants, however, often use their Chinese name as <b>their</b> <b>legal</b> <b>name</b> and adopt a non-Chinese name for casual use only.|$|E
5000|$|Skaters are not {{required}} to use derby names, and a few do skate under <b>their</b> <b>legal</b> <b>names.</b> This may be due to dissatisfaction with the name which they used in the past, or, like leading London Rollergirls skater Stephanie Mainey, in an effort to legitimise the sport. [...] Other skaters counter that derby names {{are an important part of}} the culture of the sport, and reflect the use of nicknames in many other sports.|$|R
50|$|A new {{bloodline}} {{has been}} recently traced {{to when the}} Dempseys came to America.

50|$|Taiwan {{has used}} Wade-Giles for decades as {{the de facto}} standard, co-existing with several {{official}} but obscure Romanizations in succession, namely, Gwoyeu Romatzyh (1928), Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (1986), and Tongyong Pinyin (2000).

5000|$|Early {{deployments}} of X.500 within {{corporations and}} institutions with entries representing {{the employees of}} those organizations often used a DIT structure which mirrored the organizational structure, with organizational unit entries corresponding to departments or divisions of the organization. The relative distinguished names of theentries for employees were often formed from the common names of the individual employees. An example DN of an early X.500/LDAP deployment might be [...] "cn=Joe Bloggs, ou=Marketing, ou=Operations, o=Example Corporation, st=CA, c=US".The disadvantage {{of this approach is}} that it when the organizational structure is changed, or if employees change <b>their</b> <b>legal</b> <b>name,</b> it can require the moving or renaming of entries in the directory, which adds both complexity and overhead and can also upset applications not designed to deal gracefully with such moves.|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{nationals}} {{often use}} aliases for non-official purposes. For example, women often {{continue to use}} their maiden names following marriage, {{even though they are}} required to adopt the same family name as their husband for <b>their</b> <b>legal</b> <b>name.</b> However, Japanese nationals are not permitted to use an alias for legal purposes: their name on any official document (e.g. domestic use Japanese identification) must match the name appearing in their family register and resident register. Japanese passports may contain alternate names in parentheses next to the family name or the given name if the Japanese can show a legal connection and use of these names overseas. Multiple alternate names are separated by slashes. Non-standard non-Hepburn romanization may also be used for the main names if one can show a legal connection using these spellings.|$|E
50|$|On January 13, 1919, Charles C.F. Wieber {{was made}} {{chairman}} of the board of directors and Frederick R. White was named president. E. J.

Raymond Owen left for a life of retirement and leisure, while Lang continued to assist the board as an honorary trustee through the mid 1920s. Although the legal name of the firm continued to be Baker, Rauch & Lang Co., following Lang's departure their products were marketed as either Raulang or Baker-Raulang products although they wouldn’t change <b>their</b> <b>legal</b> <b>name</b> until 1937. The board continued to use Lang's close personal relationship with the Astor family and market the luxury vehicles at shows hosted at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City.|$|E
50|$|Sites such as Chatroulette, Omegle, and Tinder (which pair up random users for a conversation) {{capitalized}} on {{a fascination with}} anonymity.
