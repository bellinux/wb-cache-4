40|$|To enhance {{terahertz}} emission from an optically excited semiconductor surface, {{we propose}} <b>to</b> <b>sandwich</b> <b>a</b> thin (as {{compared to the}} terahertz wavelength) semiconductor layer between a dielectric hyperhemispherical lens and metal substrate. The layer is excited through the lens. The substrate provides constructive interference of terahertz waves emitted to the lens directly from the layer and reflected by the substrate.

Subsequently, the rest of the structure which comprises GaAs/NiFe/Au is inverted in such a way that the GaAs layer lies on the top of the NiFe layer. The mean roughness of the inverted GaAs surface is 1. 2 nm and it is crack free. In the first process, structures with an area of tens of microns are inverted on the same chip. In the second process, small disks with an area of a few microns are inverted on a different host chip. (C) 2003 American Vacuum Society...|$|R

25|$|By the 1920s, most banks avoided using safes {{and instead}} turned to gigantic, heavy vaults with walls and doors several feet thick. These {{were meant to}} {{withstand}} not only robbers but also angry mobs and natural disasters. Despite the new security measures, these vaults were still vulnerable to yet another new invention, the cutting torch. Burning oxygen and acetylene gas at about , the torch could easily cut through steel. It was in use as early as 1907, but became widespread with World War I. Robbers used cutting torches in over 200 bank robberies in 1924 alone. Manufacturers learned <b>to</b> <b>sandwich</b> <b>a</b> copper alloy into vault doors.

40|$|InAs/GaSb {{strained}} layer superlattices {{have been}} grown by atmospheric pressure MOVPE {{and the growth}} conditions optimised by observing, in real time, the in-situ UV absorption of the alkyls in the growth chamber.

Atomic force microscopy has also been used to give information about the final surface morphology and RMS roughness of the superlattices. By combining all three techniques, optimum conditions have been found for the growth of short period InAs/GaSb superlattices. These have been used <b>to</b> <b>sandwich</b> <b>a</b> long period superlattice designed for transport measurements. The use of the short period superlattices eliminated additional conducting layers at each end of the semimetallic superlattice and produced structures where the hole and electron densities are equal.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We report herein the {{development}} of a simple, sensitive colorimetric magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) −enzyme-based DNA sandwich assay that is suitable for simultaneous, label-free quantitation of two DNA targets down to 50 fM level. It can also effectively discriminate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with human cancers (KRAS codon 12 / 13 SNPs). This assay uses a pair of specific DNA probes, one being covalently conjugated to an MNP for target capture and the other being linked to an enzyme for signal amplification, <b>to</b> <b>sandwich</b> <b>a</b> DNA target, allowing for convenient magnetic separation and subsequent efficient enzymatic signal amplification for high sensitivity. Careful optimization of the MNP surfaces and assay conditions greatly reduced the background, allowing for sensitive, specific detection of as little as 5 amol (50 fM in 100 μL) of target DNA. Moreover, this sensor is robust, it can effectively discriminate cancer-specific SNPs against the wild-type noncancer target, and it works efficiently in 10 % human serum. Furthermore, this sensor can simultaneously quantitate two different DNA targets by using two pairs of unique capture- and signal-DNA probe...|$|R
