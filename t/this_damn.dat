500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of <b>this</b> <b>damn</b> near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Lindsay was {{confident}} that the Oxford crew would be more motivated than their opponents: [...] "our advantage over Cambridge {{is that we are}} hungry for the victory. [...] Everyone in the Oxford boat is driven to go and win <b>this</b> <b>damn</b> thing". [...] He was making his third and final appearance in the race having lost in both the 1997 and 1998 race. [...] His grandfather represented Cambridge in the 1930s, and his uncle, Alexander Lindsay, rowed for the losing Oxford crew in the 1959 race before triumphing the following year. [...] Cambridge boat club president and Canadian international rower Brad Crombie was also making his third Boat Race appearance, attempting to complete a hat-trick of victories. [...] Sean Bowden was the head coach of Oxford. His Cambridge counterpart, Robin Williams, suggested [...] "it still feels like all or nothing to us. [...] The fear of defeat, the aim of trying to push the limits is motivation itself". [...] Just as he had done in the 1993 race, umpire Mark Evans introduced modifications to the starting procedure, suggesting that he would be content to hold the crews for up to ten seconds between issuing the [...] "set" [...] and [...] "go" [...] commands. [...] Cambridge's Williams remarked: [...] "I'm happy as long as both crews abide by it", Bowden was nonplussed [...] "Go is when you start races. [...] I'm happy." ...|$|E

2500|$|At each concert, Brooks {{and crew}} {{return to the}} stage and perform [...] "The Fever". Brooks dances on a {{conveyor}} belt as the drummer's sphere rises above the stage. Following the performance, the band leaves the stage once again. Brooks then returns, often unaccompanied, for what he dubs the [...] "housekeeping segment", in which he scans the crowd for fans with signs requesting songs, performing them acoustically. In some instances (such as the Atlanta concerts in September 2014), he may also perform acoustic covers of songs like [...] "Amarillo By Morning", [...] "Night Moves", and [...] "Piano Man". Regardless, the encore set commonly concludes with the band returning to perform [...] "Much Too Young (To Feel <b>This</b> <b>Damn</b> Old)".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{offers from}} various record labels, LeDoux {{refused to sign}} a {{recording}} contract, instead choosing to retain his independence and control over his work while enjoying his regional following. [...] In 1989, however, he shot to national prominence when he was mentioned in the debut song of Garth Brooks' Top 10 country hit [...] "Much Too Young (To Feel <b>This</b> <b>Damn</b> Old)." [...] Capitalizing on the sudden attention, LeDoux {{signed a contract with}} Capitol Records subsidiary Liberty Records and released his first national album, Western Underground, in 1991. His follow-up album, Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy, was certified gold and reached the Top 10. The title track, a duet with Brooks, became LeDoux's first and only Top 10 country single, reaching No. 7 in 1992. In concert, he ended the song by saying, [...] "Thanks, Garth!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Commander David Carlson, {{commanding}} officer of , the warship stationed nearest to Vincennes {{at the time of}} the incident, is reported [...] to have said that the destruction of the aircraft [...] "marked the horrifying climax to Captain Rogers's aggressiveness, first seen four weeks ago". His comment referred to incidents on 2 June, when Rogers had sailed Vincennes too close to an Iranian frigate undertaking a lawful search of a bulk carrier, launched a helicopter within [...] of an Iranian small craft despite rules of engagement requiring a four-mile (6.4km) separation, and opened fire on small Iranian military boats. Of those incidents, Carlson commented, [...] "Why do you want an Aegis cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn't a smart thing to do." [...] He also said that Iranian forces he had encountered in the area a month prior to the incident were [...] "pointedly non-threatening" [...] and professional. At the time of Rogers's announcement to higher command that he was going to shoot down the plane, Carlson is reported [...] to have been thunderstruck: [...] "I said to folks around me, 'Why, what the hell is he doing?' I went through the drill again. F-14. He's climbing. By now <b>this</b> <b>damn</b> thing is at 7,000 feet." [...] Carlson thought Vincennes might have more information, and was unaware that Rogers had been wrongly informed that the plane was diving. Carlson is also reported to have written in the U.S. Naval Proceedings that he had [...] "wondered aloud in disbelief" [...] on hearing of Vincenness intentions, speculating that the ship, known as [...] "Robo Cruiser" [...] for its aggressiveness, [...] "felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis in the Persian Gulf, and that they hankered for the opportunity to show their stuff." ...|$|E
