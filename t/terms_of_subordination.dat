40|$|Systems {{living in}} complex non equilibrated environments often exhibit subdiffusion {{characterized}} by a sublinear power-law scaling of the mean square displacement. One {{of the most common}} models to describe such subdiffusive dynamics is the continuous time random walk (CTRW). Stochastic trajectories of a CTRW can be described mathematically in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> a <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> a normal diffusive process by an inverse Levy-stable process. Here, we propose a simpler Langevin formulation <b>of</b> CTRWs without <b>subordination.</b> By introducing a new type of non-Gaussian noise, we are able to express the CTRW dynamics in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> a single Langevin equation in physical time with additive noise. We derive the full multi-point statistics of this noise and compare it with the noise driving scaled Brownian motion (SBM), an alternative stochastic model describing subdiffusive behaviour. Interestingly, these two noises are identical up {{to the level of the}} 2 nd order correlation functions, but different in the higher order statistics. We extend our formalism to general waiting time distributions and force fields, and compare our results with those of SBM.

40|$|Legal-based Ontologies Between serious {{needs and}} {{challenging}} realities Lahousseine Id-youss, Frieda Steurs & Abied Alsulaiman Ku Leuven Abstract: Analysing the conceptual {{knowledge of a}} subject-field into a system, where the conceptual relations between different concepts in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>subordination</b> and coordination become clearly visible, is of utmost importance in terminology work (De Bessé, 1997; Cabré, 1999). As a matter of fact, the construction of such concept systems constitutes the final goal of thematic terminology research as opposed to ad hoc research where the focus is usually on isolated individual concepts (Thelen, 2012). Establishing law-based concept systems {{seems to have a}} unique position in comparison with other kinds of ontologies, and this can be attributed partly to the special character of legal corpora and partly to the nature of legal concepts (Sarcevic, 1997; Cao, 2007). While most ontologies are applicable at world level, their legal counterparts have a national (or regional) character. Legal concepts emerge and evolve within national or geographic borders independently of their counterparts {{in the rest of the}} world, and this reality has serious consequences for communication across legal systems. Communication across legal systems comes in the form of comparative law, which is concerned with examining basic terms and legal structures in an international context (Galdia, 2003), as well as in the form of legal translation where functional equivalence across legal systems is sought. Legal translation itself is sometimes viewed as an act of comparative law (De Groot, 1992, cited in Sarcevic, 1997), because the two fields basically deal with the same kind of semasiological and onomasiological problems. Semasiologically speaking, legal concepts exhibit a great deal of conceptual asymmetries, in the sense that concepts belonging to different legal systems have different internal realities (Id-youss, 2016). In the same vein, legal notions can sometimes be peculiar to a legal system, a phenomenon known as “system-bound concepts” (Sarcevic, 1997). These two factors, among other ones, make legal communication an arduous task. From an onomasiological perspective, the systemic diversity that has just been referred to gives rise to issues of lexical gaps. Obviously, the problem of ‘lexical gap’ should not be seen here as a simple linguistic matter which may entail that the concept exists but its designation in another language is absent due to standardization issues. In this article we will attempt to further illustrate the peculiar nature of legal ontologies based on the outcome of a Ph. D., carried out in the fields of marital and divorce laws in Morocco (Id-youss, 2016). The methods pursued in conceptually analysing the two subject-fields will be outlined, and the resulting marriage and divorce concept systems will be presented.

40|$|Abstract. Coordination is a {{syntactic}} construction with a varying semantics. I {{argue that}} besides additive, disjunctive and more specialized kinds of coordination, {{there is another}} main type, namely {{one that can be}} characterized as specification. Grammatical configurations involving specifying coordination can be found at diverse levels of sentence structure. This provides an new perspective on a range of syntactic phenomena, such as apposition, parenthesis, left- and right-dislocation, and extraposition. Certainly, all these constructions are different, and they have been studied before in isolation – but they also have properties in common. I propose a basic typology in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> four independent factors: restrictiveness, anchoring, backgrounding, and place of attachment. A common problem for the analysis of non-restrictive material {{is that it is a}} priori unclear how to incorporate such phrases and clauses in the host structure, since the syntactic relationship between the two cannot be expressed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> regular <b>subordination,</b> which is an automatic result of syntactic merger according to the standard view. Furthermore, several types of phrases or clauses can show up either in a dislocated position or as an intervening parenthesis, which is also unexpected from a traditional perspective. These problems can be solved by means of the particular mode of construal discussed in this chapter, specifying coordination, which is then divided into two kinds: i) restrictive specifying coordination, which can be used to explain extraposition, ii) non-restrictive (parenthetical) specifying coordination, which triggers a secondary message (a proposition if the parenthesis is anchored). Thus, it is shown that superficially very different syntactic constructions make use of the same abstract mechanisms. 1...|$|R
