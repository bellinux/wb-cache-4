In this study, the vibration method using the least square estimation has been implemented to monitor changing tensions of two multi-strand cables of a {{cable-stayed bridge}} under construction.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress {{distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll tensioning was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region, <b>the</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region to inside. In the exterior loop of <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region, <b>the</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region to outside. This distribution of tangential tensioning stress is not very ideal relatively. <b>The</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stresses of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. <b>The</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential tensioning stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because <b>the</b> hammer <b>tensioning</b> creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. <b>The</b> force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during <b>the</b> multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. A cyclic symmetry {{stress distribution}} and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by <b>the</b> multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of <b>the</b> automatic <b>tensioning</b> operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

40|$|Cable {{tension is}} one of the {{important}} indexes of cable integrity as well as bridge stability and can be measured by various tension measurement methods. In this study, three widely used methods (i. e., the lift-off test, electromagnetic sensor method, and vibration method) have been implemented for two multistrand cables of a cable-stayed bridge under construction. The test bridge is Hwamyung Bridge in Korea, which has a prestressed concrete box girder. The field tests are executed during <b>the</b> second <b>tensioning</b> stage just after the installation of the key segment. <b>The</b> <b>tensions</b> are estimated before and after <b>tensioning</b> <b>the</b> cable and 5 days later (i. e., after finishing <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> of all <b>the</b> cables). <b>The</b> <b>tensions</b> measured by <b>the</b> three methods are compared with <b>the</b> design <b>tension</b> of <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> stage, and all three methods show very good performance in accuracy with minimal difference. Their cost and difficulty are compared based on test experiences. Additionally, an improved vibration method is proposed by ignoring apparent negative bending stiffness identified from measurement errors and validated in this test by improving the accuracy. close 0...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} confer optimal {{strength}} and stiffness to the graft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, {{the maintenance of}} equal strand tension prior to fixation, is desired; positioning of <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> device can significantly affect strand tension This study aimed to determine <b>the</b> effect of <b>tensioning</b> device mal-positioning on individual strand tension in simulated cadaveric ACL reconstructions. Methods Twenty cadaveric specimens, comprising bovine tibia and tendon harvested from sheep, were used to simulate ACL reconstruction with a looped four-strand tendon graft. A proprietary tensioning device was used to <b>tension</b> <b>the</b> graft during tibial component fixation with graft tension recorded using load cells. The effects of <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> device at extreme angles, and in various locking states, was evaluated. Results Strand tension varied significantly when <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> device was held at extreme angles (p Conclusion An even distribution of tension among individual graft strands is obtained by maintaining <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> device in an unlocked state, aligned with the longitudinal axis of the tibial tunnel. If the maintenance of equal strand tension during tibial fixation of grafts is important, close attention must be paid to positioning of <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> device in order to optimize <b>the</b> resultant graft <b>tension</b> and, by implication, the strength and stiffness of the graft and ultimately, surgical outcome. </p...|$|R
