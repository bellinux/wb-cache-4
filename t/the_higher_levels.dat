5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

The four gatis are: deva (demi-gods), manuṣya (humans), nāraki (hell beings) and tiryañca (animals, plants and micro-organisms). The four gatis have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered Jain universe: demi-gods occupy <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.|$|E

5|$|Overall the {{operation}} appeared to meet few of its initial aims. The political approach did {{lead to an}} increased discussion amongst {{the lower levels of}} Swedish officialdom as to the possibility of an invasion in Norway. However, it failed to convince <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of government (with the exception of Nordenskiöld, who did not communicate his beliefs to anyone). Even the purchase of Norwegian securities went unnoticed. The overriding belief within the Swedish government was that any invasion of Norway would be diversionary, and that the European mainland would always be the main target of the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because {{of the way}} the system of locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
5|$|Roland {{was born}} on 26 January 1899 and {{initially}} followed {{a career in the}} army. He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the company may have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|E

50|$|Multi-level caches can be {{designed}} in various ways {{depending on whether the}} content of one cache is present in other level of caches.

If <b>the</b> lower level cache contains blocks that are not present in <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> cache, then <b>the</b> lower level cache is said to be exclusive of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> cache. If <b>the</b> contents of the lower level cache are neither strictly inclusive nor exclusive of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> cache, then it is called non-inclusive non-exclusive (NINE) cache.|$|R

50|$|The {{closure of}} the Three Bridges-Ashurst Junction line after the last train on Sunday 1 January 1967 spelt the end for <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station and St Margaret's Loop which would receive no further traffic. The goods yard had been {{virtually}} closed for some time except for coal and all freight facilities were formally withdrawn as from 10 April. Although very nearly redundant, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> goods sidings could still be accessed via <b>the</b> low to <b>high</b> <b>level</b> connecting spur; both spurs serving <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station were however closed in 1967. The last train to use the station was in February 1968, a tracklifting train hauled by a Class 33 diesel locomotive. As the footbridge at the low-level platforms had been demolished in Summer 1965, passengers used <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station as a short-cut between platforms, thereby avoiding the need to go around a local housing estate. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>level's</b> demolition in 1970 led to protests from passengers {{at the loss of}} the short-cut, as a result of which British Rail erected a footbridge which today marks the site of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station.|$|R
