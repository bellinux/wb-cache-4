40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S) diffusion into activated sludge (AS) on odor and {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentrations in offgas were studied over an 8 -week period. Most VOCs detected in the offgas of both aeration tanks were aromatic hydrocarbons. The VOC concentrations generally decreased when H 2 S was introduced to <b>the</b> <b>AS</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the control, indicating a negative effect of H 2 S on VOC removal. Two volatile organic sulfur compounds present in the test AS offgas showed an increase followed by a decrease during H 2 S peak loads. Six VOCs and odor concentration increased during the introduction of an H 2 S peak; however no correlation was observed between H 2 S and odor concentration. The increase in odor concentration resulted from {{the increase in the}} concentration of six aromatic VOCs, which had their removal slowed down during a 100 -ppmv H 2 S peak. Activated sludge diffusion provides effective H 2 S removal with minimal affect on odor emissions...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{eukaryotic}} {{gene expression}} demonstrate {{the importance of}} nuclear steroid receptor coactivators in mediating efficient gene transcription. However, {{little is known about}} the physiological role of these coactivators in vivo. In Japanese quail, the steroid receptor coactivator- 1 (SRC- 1) is broadly expressed in steroid-sensitive brain areas that control the expression of male copulatory behavior, and we investigated the role of this coactivator by antisense technology. Daily intracerebroventricular injections of locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense (AS) oligonucleotides targeting SRC- 1 significantly reduced the expression of androgen- and estrogen-dependent male-typical sexual behaviors compared with control animals that received the vehicle alone or scrambled oligonucleotides. Sexual behavior was restored and even enhanced within 48 h after interruption of LNA injections. Western blot analysis confirmed the decrease of SRC- 1 expression in AS animals and suggested an overexpression 48 h after the end of injections. The effects of SRC- 1 knock-down on behavior correlated with a reduction in volume of the preoptic medial nucleus (POM) when its borders were defined by Nissl staining or by aromatase immunohistochemistry. The amount of aromatase-immunoreactive material in POM was also reduced in <b>the</b> <b>AS</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the control group. Previous work on SRC- 1 knock-out mice raised questions about the importance of this specific coactivator in the regulation of reproductive behavior and development of sexually dimorphic structures in the CNS. Together, the present findings indicate that SRC- 1 modulates steroid-dependent gene transcription and behavior and highlight the rapid time course of steroid-induced brain plasticity in adult quail.
