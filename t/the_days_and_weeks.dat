5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> {{following}} the disaster, police fed false stories {{to the press}} suggesting that hooliganism and drinking by Liverpool supporters were {{the root causes of}} the disaster. Blaming of Liverpool fans persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990, which found that the main cause of the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police (SYP). Following the Taylor report, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution of individuals or institutions. The disaster also led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds, notably the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> that followed, {{relatives}} {{and friends of the}} victims took the bodies for private burial and collected the abandoned belongings from the Greathead. The sea search for the Darlwyne wreck continued through the autumn and winter and into 1967, led by HMS Iveston. This navy minesweeper, equipped with the latest sonar equipment, carried out exhaustive searches in the area around Dodman Point, thought to be the vessel's most likely resting place. Although more than 600 dives were carried out, no sign of Darlwyne was discovered. In December 1966 the navy storeship HMS Maxim investigated the seabed around Looe, after reports that a trawler had lost its nets after they caught on an unidentified object.|$|E
25|$|Between 1972 and 1991, 29 {{volcanic}} eruptions were recorded, mostly on Java. The two most violent {{volcanic eruptions}} {{in modern times}} occurred in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 people. Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years. Also the eruption created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed Southeast Asia, plunging it into darkness for a week, and made a whole world without a summer in 1815. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa {{was one of the}} deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. Nearly 40,000 deaths are attributed to the eruption itself and the tsunamis it created. Significant additional effects were also felt around the world in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> after the volcano's destruction.|$|E

500|$|Following the 1939 Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland, {{resulting in the}} partition of Polish territory between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (USSR), Jewish communities in eastern Poland welcomed with some relief the Soviet occupation, which they saw as a [...] "lesser of two evils" [...] than openly antisemitic Nazi Germany. The image of Jews among the Belorussian and Ukrainian minorities waving red flags to welcome Soviet troops had great symbolic meaning in Polish memory of the period. Young Jews joined or organized communist militias, others organized a new, communist, temporary self-government. Such militias often disarmed and arrested Polish soldiers, policemen and other authority figures; often, Poles and the Polish states were mocked. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> following the events of September 1939, the Soviets engaged in a harsh policy of Sovietization. Polish schools and other institutions were closed, Poles were dismissed from jobs of authority, often arrested and deported, and replaced with non-Polish personnel.|$|E
500|$|American {{casualties}} in the battle were very light, and are therefore not listed in the table below. [...] Two Virginia officers, Capt. William Washington and Lt.

[...] (Monroe, the future United States president, suffered a wound to the neck that very nearly killed him. [...] His life was saved by a doctor who volunteered his services to the army as it marched through New Jersey that morning.) Two privates {{are known to have}} died in the battle, and one account includes mention of two men dying from exposure on the march.

40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} (PA) improves {{health outcomes}} accumulating {{evidence suggests that}} sedentary time (ST), especially parent-reported screen-time, is associated with negative health outcomes in children. The aim {{of the present study}} is to describe levels and patterns of PA <b>and</b> ST across <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> activity pattern differences between the sexes, across all weekdays and time spent in and outside the preschool in four-year old children. Methods In total 899 four-year old Swedish children who had both complete questionnaire data on screen-time behaviors and objective activity variables and at least 4 days, including one weekend day, with more than 10  h of GT 3 X+ Actigraph accelerometer wear time data were included in the study. Patterns of PA <b>and</b> ST across <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> differences between sexes, weekdays vs. weekend <b>days</b> <b>and</b> time in preschool vs. time spent outside preschool were assessed. Results Children engaged in 150  min (SD 73) and 102  min (SD 60) of screen-time on weekend <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weekdays, with 97 % and 86 % of children exceeding the 1 h guideline for screen-time on weekend <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weekdays, respectively. Accelerometer data showed that boys are more active and less sedentary compared with girls and both sexes were more active and less sedentary on weekdays compared with weekend days, while parent-reported data showed that boys engage in more screen-time compared with girls. Children accumulated 24. 8  min (SD. 19) MVPA during preschool time and 26. 6  min (SD. 16) outside preschool hours on weekdays, compared with 22. 4  min (SD. 18) MVPA during preschool time and 25. 3  min (SD. 22) outside preschool hours on weekend days. Conclusions Four-year old Swedish children display different activity patterns across <b>the</b> <b>day</b> on weekdays compared to weekend days, with preschool hours during weekdays being the most active segments and preschool hours during weekend <b>days</b> being <b>the</b> least active segments of <b>the</b> <b>day...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> {{leading up}} to Bear's collapse, the bank's CDS spread widened dramatically, {{indicating}} a surge of buyers taking out protection on the bank. [...] It has been suggested [...] that this widening {{was responsible for the}} perception that Bear Stearns was vulnerable, and therefore restricted its access to wholesale capital, which eventually led to its forced sale to JP Morgan in March. [...] An alternative view is that this surge in CDS protection buyers was a symptom rather than a cause of Bear's collapse; i.e., investors saw that Bear was in trouble, and sought to hedge any naked exposure to the bank, or speculate on its collapse.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the bombing}} of Pearl Harbor, the Civilian Conservation Corps camp {{contained}} within Griffith Park was converted to a holding center for Japanese Americans arrested as [...] "enemy aliens" [...] before they were transferred to more permanent internment camps. The Griffith Park Detention Camp opened almost immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack, taking in 35 Japanese immigrants suspected of fifth column activity because they lived and worked near military installations.

2500|$|Leon Czolgosz, a Polish American born in Alpena, Michigan, changed American {{history in}} 1901 by assassinating U.S. President William McKinley.

Police who arrested him reported that Czolgosz himself identified as a Pole. The Polish American community in Buffalo was deeply ashamed and angry with the negative publicity that Czolgosz created, both for their community and the Pan-American Exposition, and canceled a Polish American parade following the attack.
