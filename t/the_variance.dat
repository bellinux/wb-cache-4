25|$|Firstly, if the omniscient mean {{is unknown}} (and is {{computed}} as the sample mean), then the sample variance is a biased estimator: it underestimates <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> {{by a factor}} of (n−1) / n; correcting by this factor (dividing by n−1 instead of n) is called Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. For example, when n=1 <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> of a single observation about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> then this bias does not arise and <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.|$|E

40|$|Valid {{use of the}} {{traditional}} independent samples ANOVA procedure requires that <b>the</b> population <b>variances</b> are equal. Previous research has investigated whether variance homogeneity tests, such as Levene’s test, are satisfactory as gatekeepers for identifying when to use or {{not to use the}} ANOVA procedure. This research focuses on a novel homogeneity of variance test that incorporates an equivalence testing approach. Instead of testing the null hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> are equal against an alternate hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> are not equal, the equivalence-based test evaluates the null hypothesis that the difference in <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> falls outside or on the border of a predetermined interval against an alternate hypothesis that the difference in <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> falls within <b>the</b> predetermined interval. Thus, with the equivalence based procedure, the alternate hypothesis is aligned with <b>the</b> research hypothesis (<b>variance</b> equality). A simulation study demonstrated that the equivalence-based test of population variance homogeneity is a better gatekeeper for the ANOVA than traditional homogeneity of variance tests. SSHR...|$|R
