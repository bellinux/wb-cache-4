5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E

5|$|Inexpensive {{powdered}} S.luteus fruit {{bodies are}} sometimes {{added to the}} more expensive B.edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice {{that is difficult to}} detect with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol.

5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion.

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Croatian {{historian}} Davor Marijan {{concluded that}} the battle was too complex for the HV and especially for the HVO.

Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica Simić, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, three {{different}} depth map estimation techniques are presented. The first method uses SUSAN operator <b>to</b> <b>detects</b> <b>the</b> features, {{followed by an}} exponentially decaying function is employed to transfer the distance of <b>the</b> <b>detected</b> features by giving more weight to the nearer vicinity pixels of feature points, which helps to measure the clarity and depth of pixels. A robust, dual-tree complex wavelets and distance transformation based framework is developed for depth map estimation in second focus measure technique. The shift-invariance and better directionality of dual-tree complex wavelets helps <b>to</b> <b>detects</b> <b>the</b> features efficiently, which helps to estimate {{the depth of the}} scene more precisely. In third depth map estimation technique, focus measure is ensure by measuring local orientation energy using a quadrature pair of steerable filters of <b>the</b> <b>detected</b> features. <b>The</b> experiments and results validates the effectiveness of proposed feature based depth map estimation approach...|$|R
5|$|The ampullae of Lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs. They {{number in}} the {{hundreds}} to thousands. Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic fields that all living things produce. This helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} most {{commonly}} transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites {{travel to the}} liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P.falciparum because P.vivax, P.ovale, and P.malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P.knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity.|$|E
