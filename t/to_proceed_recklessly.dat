As the course {{has a real}} danger of rolling over due to the steep hills, each contestant, after their run, must coach the contestant going after him. Jakob, going first with Andrew as his guide, proceeds calmly, and gets Arun {{to do the same}}. When Arun tries to do the same to Mike, an experienced off-roader, Mike <b>proceeds</b> <b>recklessly</b> and fails. Similarly, Angelina, intimidated by Mike, also <b>proceeds</b> <b>recklessly</b> on her run.|$|R

To {{make it up}} to Fogell, they pretend to arrest him to boost his social standing, then <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> drive <b>recklessly</b> and destroy their car with a Molotov cocktail while Fogell shoots it with the cop's firearm. At Evan's house, Seth reveals to Evan that he knew all along that Fogell was Evan's roommate in college after looking at papers Evan had lying around with that information. Evan reveals he didn't want to room with Fogell and only did it because he didn't want to live with strangers. He then confesses his true brotherly love feelings to Seth who in return shows the same feelings. Seth and Evan patch things up and declare their friendship for each other. The next morning, they go to the mall to buy stuff for college, where they meet Jules and Becca, and they all reconcile. Seth takes Jules to buy concealer for her bruise, while Evan and Becca leave their friends to go buy a new comforter to replace the one that Becca vomited on. Evan and Seth go their separate ways.|$|R
5000|$|Never had King Christian {{seemed so}} {{powerful}} as {{upon his return}} to Denmark on 5 September 1521, and, with the confidence of strength, he at once <b>proceeded</b> <b>recklessly</b> <b>to</b> inaugurate the most sweeping reforms. Soon after his return he issued his great Landelove, or Code of Laws. For the most part this is founded on Dutch models, and testifies in a high degree to the king's progressive aims. Provision was made for better education of the lower clergy, and the political influence of the higher clergy is restricted. There were stern prohibitions against wreckers and [...] "the evil and unchristian practice of selling peasants {{as if they were}} brute beasts"; the old trade guilds were retained, but the rules of admittance thereto made easier, and trade combinations of the richer burghers, {{to the detriment of the}} smaller tradesmen, were sternly forbidden.|$|R

5000|$|The Figure-Eight Challenge: For {{the final}} {{challenge}} of this episode, drivers must reverse {{a school bus}} (technically a [...] "skoolie") through a figure-eight course without hitting anything, with usage of the side mirrors being paramount. Klyne, who is first, <b>proceeds</b> <b>recklessly</b> through the challenge, causing substantial damage to the course and not even seeming to attempt to take the challenge seriously. While Andrew is furious with Klyne, he's far more angry with Maureen, who continued to cheer him on and claimed {{him to be a}} good driver {{even in the face of}} the damage he was causing. Prior to attempting the challenge, Kevin reveals to Andrew that he usually doesn't bother checking his wing mirrors, something which quickly becomes obvious as he relies on the conflicting directions of the other candidates and causes a similarly large amount of damage to the course. Margherita at least takes the challenge seriously and tries to use her mirrors, but fares little better than the two previous drivers. Things start looking up with Azim, who takes some time to get around the course, but causes nearly no damage. Diane suffers more anxiety problems and has to be coached by Andrew in the early sections, but she eventually completes the course without much trouble. Flora has trouble comprehending how to use her mirrors, and duly fails the challenge. Finally, Dallas completes the challenge with few difficulties, and shows none of the stress related problems she has been suffering with until now.|$|R
