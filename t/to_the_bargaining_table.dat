Between 1906 and 1911, the Iron Workers blew up 110 iron works, though {{only a few thousand}} dollars in damages was done.

The fund's trustees put pressure on Wheeling-Pitt's owners, Dewey Investors, to settle the strike. As Wheeling-Pitt's stock price fell by 50 percent and the pension fund's financial pressures increased, the owners agreed to end the strike. The union at Wheeling-Pitt emerged with a stronger contract, one which included a defined benefit pension plan.|$|E
25|$|In early 1978, Medina was {{appointed}} the UFW's organizing director. In {{his first three}} months in office, the union won 13 elections and added more than 3,000 new members. He also changed the way the UFW approached strikes. In the past, the union would strike but end the walkout once the union had won the organizing election (held under the procedures of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act). Employers would then file numerous appeals to the election, and over the many months (and sometimes years) it took for the appeals to be heard the union's support would vanish. Medina's new strategy {{was to keep the}} workers on strike even after the organizing election was won; this pressured employers to waive their legal right to appeal, recognize the union, and enter collective bargaining neogtiations immediately. If negotiations stalled, Medina's back-up strategy was ask union members to perform their jobs sloppily and then leave work. The employer would institute a lockout, a strike would begin, and the employer would return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> to get the harvest in.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The current {{environment}} presents dramatic {{challenges for}} the American labor movement. Structural change in the economy has meant job loss in traditionally unionized sectors such as heavy manufacturing, and job gains in the less unionized service industries. Deregulation and increased international trade have created competitive pressures on unionized industries, resulting in significant concessions {{and a reduction in}} bargaining power. Simultaneously, unions have contended for twelve years with unfriendly government regulators who have displayed little commitment to timely and vigorous enforcement of protective labor legislation. In particular, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) of the Reagan and Bush administrations has reinterpreted the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), weakening protections for union activity and relaxing restrictions on management practices. The combinations of competitive pressures and a more congenial legal setting has fostered more vigorous management opposition <b>to</b> unions at <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table,</b> during organizing campaigns, and in the courts...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] As UFCW {{international}} and local leaders know from first hand experience, there have been {{dramatic changes in the}} retail grocery industry over the past 15 years. Of most direct relevance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> environment, <b>the</b> absolute size of key corporations has increased and economic power in the industry has become more concentrated. Influenced by the spread of Wal-Mart 2 ̆ 7 s grocery operations, established companies like Kroger, Safeway, Supervalu, and Loblaw have pursued aggressive merger and market expansion strategies. Further complicating the situation has been the success of other alternative format grocers (such as Costco, Trader Joe 2 ̆ 7 s, Whole Foods, and BJ 2 ̆ 7 s), and the entry and expanding influence of global corporations. Clearly, the competitive nature of the market has been irrevocably altered. Another aspect of the change in <b>the</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> environment has been the decline in the relative strength that <b>the</b> UFCW brings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> While <b>the</b> UFCW 2 ̆ 7 s total membership numbers have marginally slipped over the past decade, the power of the key industry employers, as noted above, has vastly increased.

25|$|After {{playing the}} first two games of the season in 1987, players went on strike for free agency. In {{response}} to the strike, team owners brought in replacement players and continued the regular season after one week. Several well-known players, including Joe Montana, Lawrence Taylor and Tony Dorsett crossed the picket lines to rejoin their teams alongside these new replacements. On October 15, players voted to end the strike, to instead pursue a legal challenge to the free agency restrictions in court. In January 1988 Judge David Doty sided with the players in ruling that the clubs' continuance of the first refusal and compensation restrictions on free agents was not protected by the labor exemption to the antitrust laws. But in July 1988 Doty refused to grant an injunction which would have freed the players from the restrictions, ruling that the federal Norris-LaGuardia Act prevented courts from issuing injunctions in labor disputes. He urged both sides of the conflict to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> while in preparation for an anti-trust trial.|$|E
25|$|Becker {{also had}} to work to resolve an ongoing and lengthy strike in the rubber industry. The United Rubber Workers had struck the Japanese-owned Bridgestone/Firestone tire {{manufacturer}} in July 1994. The company subsequently hired more than 6,000 workers to permanently replace the strikers. The 74,000-member Rubber Workers Union voted {{to return to work}} without a contract. Although the Rubber Workers had rejected merger with the Steelworkers and other unions in the past, now the union's leadership sought merger. The merger was agreed to just as the workers returned to work, and approved by Rubber Workers' members in July 1995. The rubber workers won immediate access to the Steelworkers' $166 million strike fund, research staff, and highly influential pension fund. Becker pushed for a comprehensive campaign strategy to be used against Bridgestone/Firestone. The Steelworkers worked with Japanese labor unions to press the company to negotiate. An innovative public campaign was used to embarrass the company at major events (including the use of a blimp at the Indianapolis 500). These tactics convinced Bridgestone/Firestone management to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table,</b> and the union eventually signed contract that weakened or eliminated a number of management's demands.|$|E
25|$|SDI {{was criticized}} for {{potentially}} disrupting the strategic doctrine of mutual assured destruction. MAD postulated that intentional nuclear attack was inhibited by the certainty of ensuing mutual destruction. Even if a nuclear first strike destroyed many of the opponent's weapons, sufficient nuclear missiles would survive to render a devastating counter-strike against the attacker. The criticism was that SDI could have potentially allowed an attacker to survive the lighter counter-strike, thus encouraging a first strike by the side having SDI. Another destabilizing scenario was countries being tempted to strike first before SDI was deployed, thereby avoiding a disadvantaged nuclear posture. Proponents of SDI argued that SDI development might instead cause the side {{that did not have}} the resources to develop SDI to, rather than launching a suicidal nuclear first strike attack before the SDI system was deployed, instead come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> with the country that did have those resources and, hopefully, agree to a real, sincere disarmament pact that would drastically decrease all forces, both nuclear and conventional. Furthermore, the MAD argument was criticized on the grounds that MAD only covered intentional, full-scale nuclear attacks by a rational, non-suicidal opponent with similar values. It did not take into account limited launches, accidental launches, rogue launches, or launches by non-state entities or covert proxies.|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{innovations}} of the 1970 s regulatory environmental {{revolution was}} the provision for citizen enforcement of regulatory standards. This innovation upset the previous bipolar regulatory model, which was a two-way negotiation between the regulated industries and the (often captive) regulatory agencies. By removing agency enforcement discretion {{as a means of}} underenforcing statutory norms, the citizens suit brought a new constituency <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regulatory <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> citizen suit had the intended effect of implementing a regime of full enforcement of the new environmental norms. But the revolutionary effect of the newly minted citizen suit was not limited to full enforcement of environmental norms. By allowing environmental interests <b>to</b> bypass <b>the</b> agency regulatory process and proceed directly to court to enforce statutory standards, the citizen suit allowed citizens to play a primary {{role in the development of}} environmental jurisprudence, bypassing the administrative rulemaking process and resulting judicial deference to agency interpretations. In a radical shift from the classic administrative law model, where the responsible agency answered questions of first impression and review of its answers was highly deferential, the citizen suit provided nongovernmental organizations to opportunity to develop their own interpretations of the environmental norms and test these interpretations in enforcement actions in the courts as a matter of first impression. Citizen enforcers thus necessarily took on the role of citizen regulators as well, developing interpretations of statutory standards and enforcing these citizen-generated interpretations directly against violators before judges untainted by regulatory accommodations negotiated in a prior rulemaking process. This article examines the role of citizen enforcement litigation in the development of the Clean Water Act law and implementation of the Clean Water Act regulatory scheme. The essay will focus on four examples where citizen enforcement litigation under the Clean Water Act had the effect of initiating the regulatory process, drawing responses from both EPA and the Congress. These case studies will include enforcement litigation brought against underenforced Clean Water Act regulation of pesticide application, water transfers, land application of CAFO wastes, and sport shooting ranges...|$|R
40|$|Although the United States {{has not yet}} passed {{national}} legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, {{there have been other}} important legal developments.

Although the lack of {{national legislation}} is unfortunate, the American system of separation of powers allows other legal action to be taken despite the paralysis in Congress. In comparison <b>to</b> Europe, <b>the</b> United States has been a notorious laggard in the area of climate change. The US never ratified the Kyoto Protocol. For most of the first decade of this century, the White House was occupied by George W Bush, a fervent opponent of action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Even when the White House changed hands, the situation remained frustrating because of the inability of <b>the</b> new administration <b>to</b> pass climate change legislation through Congress. Nevertheless, {{it would be a mistake}} to assume that U. S law has ignored the issue of climate change. The American constitutional system diffuses power between Congress, the executive branch, the federal courts, and state government. When one or more of those institutions fails to act, others may step in <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> breach. That is exactly what has happened with climate change. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vigorous efforts of federal courts and of many state governments, important and constructive steps have been taken to address climate change. The first part of this article discusses the activities of the federal courts concerning climate change and shows how they have pressed the federal executive branch <b>to</b> take action. <b>The</b> second part of the article discusses the role that state governments have played in creating climate policy. That section also introduces some of the constitutional issues regarding federalism that may restrict state regulation. Finally, the article discusses the evolving U.
