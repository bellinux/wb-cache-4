Another road was built in 1834 in the watershed, followed by another road several years later that ran between the West Branch Susquehanna River and Cross Fork. Butler Road {{was built on the}} western side of the watershed in 1850. The first post office in the watershed was established at Westport in 1847.

5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on <b>the</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>shore</b> each year is 1 in 200.|$|E
5|$|Isabel passed 215miles (350km) {{southwest}} of the state, though its large wind core produced tropical storm force winds {{across much of the}} state. The winds downed hundreds of trees and power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands without power. A falling tree killed one person. Hurricane Isabel produced rough waves and a moderate storm surge along the coastline. One person was killed from the rough waves, and at least 50 locations along <b>the</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Shore</b> reported beach erosion from the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from Mexico, Raynolds resumed mapping the U.S.–Canada border {{which he had}} been surveying before the war, then embarked on a project to develop water resources for the nation's growing capital of Washington, D.C. Raynolds traveled the Great Lakes for several years surveying and mapping shorelines while identifying potential lighthouse locations. After promotion to first lieutenant and then captain, in 1857 he was assigned to design and supervise the construction of lighthouses along <b>the</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Shore</b> and the Delmarva Peninsula regions. in the late 1850s Raynolds supervised construction of the Fenwick Island Light in Delaware and the Cape May Light in New Jersey. In 1859, he made alterations to the Jupiter Inlet Light in Jupiter, Florida.|$|E
5|$|News {{stations}} were stationed with crews along <b>the</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>shore</b> {{several days in}} advance of Isabel to provide breaking news and live conditions. Many residents prepared their houses by boarding windows and purchasing emergency supplies. The Sussex County chapter of the American Red Cross advised local high schools to be on stand-by as potential shelters in the event evacuation occurred. Emergency coordinators in several counties were on alert, though none issued evacuations. In preparation for anticipated power outages, the Jersey Central Power and Light company arranged to receive more electrical crews from its parent company, FirstEnergy.

5|$|The new bridge {{remained}} in place along Route31A, however, no new {{portions of the}} freeway were constructed in terms of creating the Route31A Freeway, as proposed in1938. In1950, then-governor of New Jersey, Alfred E. Driscoll, cited {{the need for the}} expressway as an important truck and passenger car highway from Trenton to <b>the</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Shore.</b> Route31A itself was decommissioned in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, and replaced by the designation of Route64. The route was truncated from both ends toward Princeton and Hightstown, leaving just the bridge in West Windsor. Route31A {{remained in}} the state highway statutes for several decades after decommissioning, with a bill in1991 being proposed. The bill passed, and Route31A was stripped from the statutes on January18,1992.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the North Branch Metedeconk River, I-195 continues into Howell Township, Monmouth County and turns northeast, reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 9. At this point, the road turns east again and soon heads back into dense woods, passing over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line. After {{crossing the}} Manasquan River, the expressway interchanges with CR 547, which {{provides access to}} CR 524 and CR 549. Shortly after CR 547, I-195 enters Wall Township and passes through Allaire State Park. The eastern end of I-195 is located at Exit 35, its junction with Route 34 that {{has access to the}} southbound Garden State Parkway from the eastbound direction. At the exit for Route 34, I-195 ends and Route 138 begins, but the highway and exit numbering continue onto Route 138, marking the interchange with the Garden State Parkway as Exit 36. Past this interchange, Route 138 continues east to Belmar on <b>the</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>Shore</b> as an arterial boulevard, making connections with Route 18 and Route 35.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} {{slightly above}} normal tides and rough surf along <b>the</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>shore,</b> killing one surfer off of Wildwood Crest. The combination of gusty winds {{and the heavy}} surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline, primarily to beaches facing southeastward. In the Delaware Bay and River area, no significant erosion was reported, though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed {{the deck of a}} house in Baypoint. In Cape May County waves eroded the beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m) in Ocean City and Avalon, with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and geotubes in Whale Beach being exposed. Waves from Isabel in Atlantic County resulted in light damage, minor coastal flooding, and slight beach erosion. The beaches of southern Ocean County experienced a loss of 3 to 4feet (0.9 to 1.2m) of sand, while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion. Most coastal areas of Monmouth County reported eroded beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m), with Union Beach losing about 5,000sq. feet (465sq. m) of sand.|$|E
