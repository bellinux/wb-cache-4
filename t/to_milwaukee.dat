5|$|The street {{kept its}} '½' until 1906, when petitioners asked the Minneapolis City Council {{to change the}} street's name to Woodland Avenue because they said the '½' made them feel like they lived in an alley.

5|$|From 1943 to 1989, no {{managerial}} term lasted {{as long as}} five complete seasons. The Braves were {{managed by}} Billy Southworth from 1946 to 1949, and again from 1950 to 1951. Southworth led the team into the 1948 World Series, which ended the Braves' 34-year postseason drought; the World Series ended in a losing result for the Braves. In 1953, the team moved from Boston <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee,</b> where it {{was known as the}} Milwaukee Braves. Its first manager in Milwaukee was Charlie Grimm, who managed the team from mid-season of 1952 to mid-season of 1956.

5|$|The Milwaukee Brewers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team {{based in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They {{play in the}} National League Central division. The {{first game of the}} new {{baseball}} season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Brewers played their inaugural season in 1969 as the Seattle Pilots, playing home games at Sick's Stadium. The team moved <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> in 1970, and played their home games at Milwaukee County Stadium until 2000. The team's current home, Miller Park, has been the Brewers' home field {{since the start of the}} 2001 season. The Pilots/Brewers played their first 29seasons in the American League, and switched leagues at the start of the 1998 season.|$|E
5|$|The Pilots' first Opening Day {{starting}} pitcher was Marty Pattin, {{who received the}} win in a 43 victory against the California Angels. After the team's move <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> in 1970, Lew Krausse Jr. was charged with the loss in a game at Milwaukee County Stadium vs. the Angels. Ben Sheets holds the club record for most Opening Day starts with six, from 2002 through 2005 and again in both 2007 and 2008. Sheets has a 30 record as a starter on Opening Day, the franchise's best record. Marty Pattin and Mike Caldwell also have perfect records; both won each of their two starts. The Brewers' 17 Opening Day losses by starters are distributed among 16 different pitchers, each having lost one game, excluding Yovani Gallardo, who has lost two.|$|E
5|$|The early {{settlers}} of Minnesota were anxiously seeking railroad transportation, but insufficient {{capital was}} available after the Panic of 1857. Rails were finally built in Minnesota in 1862, when the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad built its first ten miles (16km) of track from the Phalen Creek area in St. Paul {{to a stop}} just short of St. Anthony Falls. The railroad continued building track from Minneapolis to Elk River in 1864 and to St. Cloud in 1866, and from Minneapolis west to Howard Lake in 1867 and Willmar in 1869. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Central, an early predecessor of the Milwaukee Road, built a line from Minneapolis to Fort Snelling in 1865. The railroad gradually extended to Faribault, Owatonna, and Austin. It crossed the Iowa border and met up with the McGregor & Western line. This connection gave Minneapolis rail service <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> via Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, with through service beginning on October 14, 1867.|$|E

50|$|As {{an analog}} station, the station's {{transmitter}} was located atop the Hilton Milwaukee City Center in downtown Milwaukee (which was previously used by WVTV, channel 18, and WDJT-TV, channel 58, before both stations moved their transmitter facilities <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee's</b> northeast side). The station's signal was directed north from that site to prevent {{interference with the}} former main digital signal of WLS-TV in Chicago (which broadcasts on virtual channel 7 and used that allocation until 2012 to carry the station inner-city after a move of the main signal to digital channel 44), and was localized <b>to</b> within <b>Milwaukee</b> County.|$|R
50|$|The Continuation School was {{established}} in 1912 near Mason Street and the Milwaukee River. Its name was changed <b>to</b> the <b>Milwaukee</b> Vocational School in 1916 as trade skills were emphasized. Enrollment grew quickly and by 1923 a new six-story building was completed at 6th & State Street. In 1968, it combined with the Milwaukee Institute of Technology <b>to</b> become <b>Milwaukee</b> Technical College. The following year, it merged with the other vocational schools {{in the metropolitan area}} <b>to</b> form <b>Milwaukee</b> Area Technical College, which {{became a member of the}} statewide Vocational, Technical and Adult Education System (now the Wisconsin Technical College System).|$|R
5|$|Until {{the early}} 2000s and despite heavy traffic, Illinois 22 {{generally}} remained a two lane road. The only sections that were four lanes were the intersections of Illinois 83, Buffalo Grove Road, Milwaukee Avenue, Interstate 94, Illinois 43, and U.S. 41. The lengthy two lane gaps in between those intersections, {{as well as}} the rest of Illinois 22 were heavily discussed for expansion starting in the early 1990s. These discussions included plans that called for additional lanes on its entire length from U.S. 14 to U.S. 41, including widening a section from U.S. 12 <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Avenue to six lanes. Also mentioned was a bypass around the narrow, downtown area of Lake Zurich.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, US16 started its run through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon. The SS Milwaukee Clipper {{operated}} as a car ferry across Lake Michigan, connecting Muskegon <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee,</b> Wisconsin, where US16 continued to the west. From the docks, US16 and M-46 traveled concurrently south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US16 turned south along Business US31 (Bus. US31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores. There, the business loop ended at US31, and US16 joined the I-196 freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US16's decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural Muskegon County parallel to the former US16 routing through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of M-104, and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of Coopersville and Marne.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1969 as the Pilots in Seattle, Washington, {{the team}} moved <b>to</b> <b>Milwaukee,</b> Wisconsin the {{following}} season, which brought top-flight baseball back to Wisconsin {{for the first}} time since the Braves departed after the 1965 season. The Brewers have been members of the National League since 1998; prior to that, the team played as a member of the American League Central Division. As such, they are the only team to appear in the Major League Baseball postseason representing both major leagues. Buck Rodgers and Harvey Kuenn led the team to one American League playoff appearance each, and Dale Sveum led the team to the 2008 National League wild card after replacing the fired Ned Yost with 12 games remaining in the season. Kuenn leads the franchise in playoff wins (6) and is the only manager inducted into the Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame, while Garner is the franchise's all-time managerial wins leader (563). The team's current manager is Craig Counsell, a former infielder who played part of his career with the Brewers, and who was hired after Ron Roenicke was fired on May 3, 2015.|$|E
