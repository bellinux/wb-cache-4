50|$|During {{post-editing}} {{the tool}} collects timing information for each segment, which is updated {{every time the}} segment is opened and closed. Moreover, for each segment, information is collected about the generated suggestions {{and the one that}} has actually been post-edited. This information is accessible at any time through a link in the Editing Page, named Editing Log. The Editing Log page (Figure 1) shows a summary of the overall editing performed so far on the project, such as the average <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> and post-editing effort and the percentage of top suggestions coming from MT or the TM. Moreover, for each segment, sorted from the slowest to the fastest in terms of <b>translation</b> <b>speed,</b> detailed statistics about the performed edit operations are reported. This information, with even more details, can be also downloaded as a CSV file to perform a more detailed post-editing analysis. While the information shown in the Edit Log page is very useful to monitor progress of a translation project in real time, the CSV file is a fundamental source of information for detailed productivity analyses once the project is ended.|$|E

This study focuses on the response of axially moving beam-like elements at <b>translation</b> <b>speeds</b> that exceed the classical "critical speed stability limit". A non-linear model for an axially moving beam is derived that accounts for the initial beam curvature induced by supporting pulleys or wheels. Presently, the model is used to determine steady responses at critical and supercritical <b>translation</b> <b>speeds.</b> The properties of the equilibrium problem are examined using an approximate linear solution and an exact, non-linear solution. The deficiency of the linear solution is illustrated by its inability to capture essential features of the equilibrium problem particularly near and above the critical speed. In this high-speed region, the translating beam undergoes large overall buckling deformations leading to multiple and bifurcated equilibrium states. The stability of the equilibria is assessed in Part II...|$|R

Imaging of terrestrial dust devils has quantified their rotational and vertical wind <b>speeds,</b> <b>translation</b> <b>speeds,</b> dimensions, dust load, {{and frequency of}} occurrence. Imaging of martian dust devils has provided <b>translation</b> <b>speeds</b> and constraints on dimensions, but only limited constraints on vertical motion within a vortex. The longer mission durations on Mars afforded by long operating robotic landers and rovers have provided statistical quantification of vortex occurrence (time-of-sol, and recently seasonal) that has until recently not been a primary outcome of more temporally limited terrestrial dust devil measurement campaigns. Terrestrial measurement campaigns have included a more extensive range of measured vortex parameters (pressure, wind, morphology, etc.) than have martian opportunities, with electric field and direct measure of dust abundance not yet obtained on Mars. No martian robotic mission has yet provided contemporaneous high frequency wind and pressure measurements. Comparison of measured terrestrial and martian dust devil characteristics suggests that martian dust devils are larger and possess faster maximum rotational wind speeds, that the absolute magnitude of the pressure deficit within a terrestrial dust devil is {{an order of magnitude}} greater than a martian dust devil, and that the time-of-day variation in vortex frequency is similar.

50|$|Although classed as a benthic copepod, this {{particular}} species of Tigriopus is surprisingly motile, {{and has been}} noted to spend prolonged amounts {{of time in the}} water column of experimental mesocosms. While copepodites (adults) have six pairs of cephalic appendages used for swimming and food collection and up to five pairs of specialized ‘‘swimming legs’’ allocated for jumping, nauplii have only three pairs of appendages to be used for motion and feeding. Therefore, the kinematics of nauplii is different from that of adults. They have a swimming-by-jumping propulsion mode, with alternating power and recovery strokes of three pairs of cephalic appendages. This is fundamentally different from the way other microplankton move, and the propulsion efficiency of the nauplii is low. Very early T. brevicornis naupliar stages tend to crawl on the substrate they are feeding on, and this may hinder their motility even further. An interesting trait of some nauplii is to beat their appendages while being stationary, which results {{in the creation of a}} strong feeding current that is about 10 times faster than the average <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> of the nauplius. More efficient feeding is a result of this clever adaptation.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} wind loading on {{buildings}} due to straight line boundary layer type winds {{have been studied}} extensively in the past. Building code estimates are mainly based on these works. Little research has been, however, done to study the effect of tornado winds on built structures. This research work essentially deals with {{the study of the}} effects of tornado type wind loading on low-rise buildings. Extensive testing was performed on a scaled down low-rise gable roof building model (1 : 100) to understand the loading pattern. The vortex generated using the ISU tornado simulator agreed well with the Doppler radar data from the Spencer, South Dakota tornado of May 30, 1998 and the Mulhall, Oklahoma tornado of May 3, 1999. The building model was tested using tornado vortices with five different core radii. The tornado could be translated using a crane mechanism; this enables realistic recreation of the actual effects on the low-rise building due to a moving vortex (which is the case in real world). The building model was also tested for four different vortex <b>translation</b> <b>speeds.</b> The lowest speed cases invariably produced larger loads. The effect of building orientation was also investigated by testing the model at seven different angles of attack. The results showed higher wind loads for the smallest vortex core with lower <b>translation</b> <b>speeds.</b> The building orientation of 60 deg had a higher loading pattern. In general the force and moment coefficients were higher than current building code provisions. Further wind tunnel tests were also carried out to study the effects of different roof types and building heights...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} several decades {{operational}} forecasts of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks have improved steadily, but intensity forecast skills have experienced rather modest improvements. Here we use 40 years of TC track data to show that storm intensity correlates with <b>translation</b> <b>speed,</b> with hurricanes of category 5 moving on average 1 m s− 1  faster than tropical storms. This correlation provides evidence that the <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> of a storm can exert a significant control on the intensity of storms by modulating the strength of the negative effect of the storm-induced sea surface temperature (SST) reduction on the storm intensification (i. e., the SST feedback) : Faster-moving storms tend to generate weaker sea surface cooling and have shorter exposure to the cooling, both of which tend to weaken the negative SST feedback. Consistently, there exists a minimum <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> for intensification and its value grows with TC intensity, resulting in a minimum <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> for the existence of a TC in each intensity category. Furthermore, a composite analysis of satellite-based SST measurements reveals that in the tropical region the average strength of the storm-induced sea surface cooling {{can be explained by the}} superposition of an effect due to the storm intensity and an effect associated with the <b>translation</b> <b>speed,</b> and implies that the variability of upper ocean stratification may not be an important factor in this region. Our results suggest that progress in the prediction of TC tracks, particularly in the <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> of storms, should lead to improved storm intensity prediction...|$|E

The {{combination of}} several factors resulted in this extreme weather event: the steep terrain in Taiwan, the prevailing south-westerly {{flow in the}} monsoon trough, Typhoon Goni over the northern South China Sea, and the slow <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> of Morakot itself over Taiwan.

Our findings were consistent with those of Cione and Uhlhorn (2003). During the passage of a typhoon, the inner-core sea surface temperature is mainly determined by vertical turbulent mixing, irrespective of the position relative to the typhoon center.

In order to avoid transient effects associated with jet startup, the sample was slowly translated under a steady jet. The translating gas jet produces a long clean path that provides very good statistics for exploring the effect of jet parameters. The dependence of the spatial distribution of removal efficiency on the jet pressure ratio, the jet height, and the <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> is examined. Clean paths greater than 16 jet diameters wide are produced with a jet pressure ratio of 7 translating at 9. 0  mm/s at a dimensionless height of 10. The path width is independent of the jet height at high pressure ratios and inversely dependent on the jet <b>translation</b> <b>speed.</b> A harmonic oscillator model for particle detachment accounts for the effect of <b>translation</b> <b>speed.</b> Results suggest that the particles act as nearly-quantized shear stress sensors that provide a direct, though as yet uncalibrated, measure of the surface shear stress.

A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model in a horizontal direction (2 DH) coupled with a storm-surge model has been employed for the study. Numerical experiments with three different cyclone translation speeds show that when the surge height is directly forced by the cyclonic wind speed especially within the RWM (Radius of Maximum Wind), faster <b>translation</b> <b>speed</b> produces reduced surge height as the cyclone gets less time to force the water. On the other hand, at locations outside the RMW, surge waves travel as a propagating long wave where higher surges are produced by faster moving cyclones.

Analysis of seven hypothetical parallel cyclone paths show that local bathymetry and complex coastline configurations strongly influence the surge height and surge arrival time along the Bangladesh coast.

X-ray powder diffraction showed an increased preferred orientation along the (200) plane at higher translation rates, although with no actual change in the particle sizes.
