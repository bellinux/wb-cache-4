5|$|After {{the slow}} {{start to the}} season, Cancellara began to achieve success in June. He rode the Tour de Suisse and won the opening <b>time</b> <b>trial,</b> along with the final stage that was also a <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b> With the opening stage victory in the Tour de Suisse, Cancellara led the race for a few stages before losing it to {{teammate}} Fränk Schleck after stage four. Cancellara continued his success in the <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> with {{a victory in the}} Swiss national <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{winning a}} few stages and small races in his {{starting}} years, Cancellara earned {{his first major}} victory at the 2004 Tour de France where he won the opening prologue <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> and wore race leader yellow jersey for one day. The following season saw fewer victories, but his 2006 season saw {{a victory in the}} men's <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> at the UCI Road World Championships, along with victory at the Paris–Roubaix.

5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b> Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b> Despite the pressure she won the <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara {{entered the}} Tour de France in July, {{but was unable}} to come away with a victory in either the team <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> or the lone {{individual}} <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b> Up next for Cancellara was the Vuelta a España, where he helped his team achieve victory in the stage one's team <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b> Cancellara's final events for the 2011 season were the road race and the <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> at the Road World Championships. Cancellara came with the hopes of winning a third consecutive <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> world crown; however, he would finish in third place after the winner Martin and runner-up Wiggins. Four days later, Cancellara lined up to race the road race. The race came down to a sprint finish that was won by Mark Cavendish; Cancellara barely missed a medal after finishing in fourth place.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 event had a {{very similar}} format to the {{previous}} year's race.

5|$|Cancellara {{entered the}} Vuelta a España and helped assist RadioShack-Leopard to a second-place {{finish in the}} race's opening team <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b> He won the stage eleven {{individual}} <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> {{by a margin of}} 37 seconds over reigning world champion Tony Martin. Cancellara then rode in support of team leader and eventual Vuelta winner Chris Horner until the seventeenth stage, after which he left the race in order to focus on the World Championships. Cancellara was seen as a contender for the gold medal in both the men's <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> and road race events at the UCI Road World Championships. Cancellara finished the <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> in third position, 48 seconds behind the winner Tony Martin, earning a bronze medal. Four days after completing the <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> event, Cancellara entered the Elite Men's road race. For most of the race, Cancellara stayed near the front of race, before being dropped however on the final climb of the day and fighting his way to tenth place. In late December, RadioShack-Leopard's general manager Luca Guercilena announced that Fabian Cancellara would attempt to break the hour record during the 2014 season.|$|E

5|$|Cancellara's 2015 {{campaign}} started strong with {{a victory}} on Stage 2 of the Tour of Oman. He outsprinted a leading ten-man group to take the honours. In the Italian race Tirreno–Adriatico, {{he had a good}} prologue, taking second place behind Adriano Malori by a single second. He {{went on to win the}} final 10km <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> of the race. In Milan–San Remo, Cancellara was in the leading group, sprinting to seventh place. The following week, Cancellara crashed badly in E3 Harelbeke, suffering two minor fractures in the transverse processes of his lower vertebrae. His injuries prevented him from defending his Tour of Flanders title, thereby ending his spring classics campaign. He came back at the Tour des Fjords in late May without registering a significant result. On home soil at the Tour de Suisse, he was second in the opening prologue and third in the final individual <b>time</b> <b>trial,</b> both times behind new <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> star Tom Dumoulin.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara's next {{victories}} season {{came at the}} Vuelta a España. He won {{the opening}} <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> and then held {{the lead of the}} race until the race's fourth stage.

5|$|Cancellara's next victory {{came at the}} Tour de Suisse {{where he}} won the prologue, which was an {{individual}} <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> around the city of Lugano. Cancellara came close to another stage win in the stage nine individual <b>time</b> <b>trial,</b> but fell short by seventeen seconds. Next, Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de France. He then held the lead until the second stage came to an end, after stage winner Sylvain Chavanel took it away. However, Cancellara regained the lead the after {{the next day and}} held it until stage seven when Chavanel again took the lead. Later in the Tour, Cancellara won the stage nineteen individual <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> that stretched from Bordeaux to Pauillac by seventeen seconds over German rider Tony Martin.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} {{criticism}} that the <b>time</b> <b>trials</b> were too important. If the <b>time</b> <b>trials</b> would have not counted towards the general classification, the result would have been as follows:The total length of the <b>time</b> <b>trials</b> reduced from 223 km in 1985 to 180 km in 1986. Tour director Levitan felt after the 1985 Tour de France that the race had been too easy, and made the course in 1986 extra difficult, including more mountain climbs than before.|$|R
50|$|After an {{experimental}} two-week schedule {{was used for}} the Indy 500 from 1998-2000, the Speedway reverted to the more traditional three-week schedule for practice, <b>time</b> <b>trials,</b> and the race. Rookie orientation was held April 13-14. <b>Time</b> <b>trials</b> were set at three days.|$|R
50|$|The UCI {{assigned}} premiums {{in all of}} {{the twelve}} events, with a total prize money of €179,805. In the individual <b>time</b> <b>trials</b> and road races the top 3 finishers win prize money and in the team <b>time</b> <b>trials</b> the top 5 teams.|$|R
5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual <b>time</b> <b>trial,</b> the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual <b>time</b> <b>trial.</b> Contador's superior <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E
5|$|Each road stage (that is, all {{the stages}} except the team <b>time</b> <b>trial</b> and the {{individual}} <b>time</b> <b>trial)</b> included an intermediate sprint. This was {{a point where the}} leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification. Many of the stages also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification, with the most difficult climbs earning the most points.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 Giro d'Italia, four {{different}} jerseys were awarded.
