5|$|<b>The</b> <b>atomic</b> radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
