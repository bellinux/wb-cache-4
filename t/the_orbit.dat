5|$|If k is close, but not equal, to one, {{the second}} orbit resembles the first, but {{revolves}} gradually about {{the center of}} force; {{this is known as}} orbital precession (Figure3).

5|$|In 1821, Alexis Bouvard {{published}} astronomical {{tables of}} <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of Neptune's neighbour Uranus. Subsequent observations revealed substantial {{deviations from the}} tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> through gravitational interaction. In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.|$|E

50|$|An orbit {{can also}} decay by tidal effects when <b>the</b> <b>orbiting</b> body {{is large enough}} to raise a {{significant}} tidal bulge on the body it is orbiting and is either in a retrograde orbit or is below <b>the</b> synchronous <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> resulting tidal interaction saps momentum from <b>the</b> <b>orbiting</b> body and transfers it to the primary's rotation, lowering <b>the</b> <b>orbit's</b> altitude until frictional effects come into play.|$|R
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of <b>the</b> <b>orbit,</b> which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E

5|$|The large orbit {{was shaped}} like an {{imperfect}} ellipse (with the longest axis {{from front to}} back), and faced {{to the side and}} slightly forward. The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the occipital condyle was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the lower front margin of <b>the</b> <b>orbit,</b> and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above <b>the</b> <b>orbit.</b> The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of <b>the</b> <b>orbit,</b> extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of <b>the</b> <b>orbit,</b> which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) {{were able to use}} one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} an {{orbiting}} body {{at any given}} time is defined by <b>the</b> <b>orbiting</b> body's position and velocity with respect to the central body, which can be represented by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (position of <b>the</b> <b>orbiting</b> body represented by x, y, and z) and the similar Cartesian components of <b>the</b> <b>orbiting</b> body's velocity. This set of six variables, together with time, are called the orbital state vectors. Given the masses of the two bodies they determine <b>the</b> full <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> two most general cases with these 6 degrees of freedom are the elliptic and <b>the</b> hyperbolic <b>orbit.</b> Special cases with fewer degrees of freedom are the circular and parabolic orbit.|$|R

5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of Mercury {{have been}} hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner {{thought he had}} seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> of Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
