5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is <b>that</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>the</b> SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest <b>that</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>the</b> Constitution recognizes an unlimited right {{to do what you want}} with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet that seems to be the manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E
25|$|The {{currents}} were {{predicted in}} 1908 by Norwegian explorer and physicist Kristian Birkeland, who undertook expeditions {{north of the}} Arctic Circle to study the aurora. He rediscovered, using simple magnetic field measurement instruments, that when the aurora appeared the needles of magnetometers changed direction, confirming the findings of Anders Celsius and assistant Olof Hjorter {{more than a century}} before. This could only imply that currents were flowing in the atmosphere above. He theorized <b>that</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>the</b> Sun emitted a cathode ray, and corpuscles from what is now known as a solar wind entered the Earth’s magnetic field and created currents, thereby creating the aurora. This view was scorned by other researchers, but in 1967 a satellite, launched into the auroral region, showed that the currents posited by Birkeland existed. In honour of him and his theory these currents are named Birkeland currents. A good description of the discoveries by Birkeland is given in the book by Jago.|$|E

Their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of the phenomena the team experience, and different team members experience different phenomena: most are able to hear sounds, Jill can also see images, but another member of the team experiences no sensory input. Jill hypothesises that the [...] "tape" [...] does not produce actual sound or light, but instead interfaces with the human nervous system during [...] to create the sensory impression of sound and vision, and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others. She surmises that the recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion, like a kind of telepathy.|$|E

2500|$|Author Simon Leng {{describes}} the melody of [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] as [...] "complex and highly original". The melody of the verses incorporates a pedal {{point on the}} key of G major and moves to G sharp minor, a progression Leng claims [...] "should not work in harmonic terms", using as an analogy a count of [...] "one, two, six", but notes <b>that</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>the</b> melody manages to work. Music professor Wilfrid Mellers explains {{the effectiveness of this}} key shift as dramatising the [...] "beware" [...] in the lyrics. Similarly, Mellers claims that harmonic movement from the key of C sharp minor to D major to C major [...] "creates the 'aimless' wandering of 'each unconscious sufferer'" [...] described in the lyrics. The nearly chromatic melody of the verses contrasts with a more standard rock melody in the middle eight. The musicians on the recording include Harrison, Eric Clapton and Dave Mason on guitar, Carl Radle on bass guitar, Bobby Whitlock on piano, Gary Wright on organ and Ringo Starr on drums.|$|E

[...] He compared the allegations to those of taxpayers in Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 486-489 (1923), [...] "or allegations that government decisions are offensive to reason or morals." [...] Justice White also expressed his position that “failure of this country’s railroads even in their present anemic condition will guarantee that recyclable materials will stay where they are – far {{beyond the reach of}} recycling plants that as a consequence may not be built at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Global citizenship, in some contexts, may {{refer to}} a brand of ethics or {{political}} philosophy {{in which it is}} proposed that the core social, political, economic and environmental realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens. [...] It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that [...] "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, cosmopolites)" [...] {{in response to a question}} about his place of origin. A Sanskrit term, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, has the meaning of [...] "the world is one family". [...] The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the Mahopanishad VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth <b>that</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>the</b> whole world has to live together like a family.|$|E
