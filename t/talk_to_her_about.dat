500|$|It aired as {{the second}} episode of the season on May 31, 1990. The episode was written by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. The narrative features Jerry Seinfeld agreeing to attend a birthday party with his ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. During the party, Jerry tries to flirt with another woman, but fails to learn anything about her except her place of work. Jerry is reluctant to ask Elaine for the woman's number {{because he does not}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> other women. Jerry's father, Morty, suggests that he [...] "stake out" [...] the woman's workplace and pretend to meet her accidentally, which Jerry does. [...] "The Stake Out" [...] is the first episode to feature Jerry's parents. The episode was nominated for a Writers Guild Award in 1991.|$|E

500|$|Tyutcheva {{took her}} book to {{other members of}} the family. Nicholas's sister Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. She wrote in her diary on 15 March 1910 that she could not {{understand}} the family's regard for Rasputin as [...] "almost a saint" [...] when she viewed him as only a [...] "khlyst". Tyutcheva told Grand Duchess Xenia that the starets visited when Olga and Tatiana were getting ready for bed and sat there talking with them and [...] "caressing" [...] them. The girls hid his presence from their governess and were afraid to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, was at first a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910. The empress refused to believe her, Vishnyakova told investigators, and said everything Rasputin did was holy. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but [...] "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." [...] Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.|$|E
2500|$|One such theory {{concerns}} Alf Boxall, who {{was reportedly}} involved in intelligence work during {{and immediately after}} World War II. In a 1978 television interview Stuart Littlemore asks: [...] "Mr Boxall, you had been working, hadn't you, in an intelligence unit, before you met this young woman [...] Did you <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> that at all?" [...] In reply, Boxall says [...] "no," [...] and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies [...] "not unless somebody else told her." [...] When Littlemore suggests in the interview {{that there may have}} been an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: [...] "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?" [...] Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.|$|E
2500|$|Grumpy tells Emma {{about the}} {{incident}} with Sleepy; she and Killian [...] "Hook" [...] Jones (Colin O'Donoghue) follow a trail of ice that Elsa left {{which leads to a}} warehouse. In order to protect herself, Elsa creates a snow monster which chases them (and others) out of the area. Emma, Hook, Robin Hood, and David Nolan (Josh Dallas) try to defeat the monster in the woods, only to all got knocked unconscious. Marian also shoots an arrow at the monster, which only serves to incur its wrath. The monster then heads towards Marian, and when Regina shows up, she merely smiles when Marian asks her to help, and disappears. However, at the last second, Regina defeats the snow monster by burning it. Marian thanks Regina, with Regina welcoming her to Storybrooke. Afterwards, Regina disappears, still heartbroken, before Emma could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the recent developments. Emma uses the recent events as a way of avoiding Hook, whom she started a relationship with. Emma later tells Regina that despite her heartbreak, she will continue to make sure that everyone has a happy ending. Regina comes to a realization: everyone in Henry's book of fairytales has a happy ending except the villain(s); she then tells Sidney to find [...] "the writer" [...] of the book so she can make her, the villain, have the happy ending.|$|E

2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood {{at the top of the}} Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E
