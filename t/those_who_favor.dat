25|$|<b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> the non-sexual {{interpretation}} {{argue against}} a denotation {{of sexual behavior}} in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13–14 times) of those references is it clearly used as a euphemism for realizing sexual intimacy. Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.|$|E
25|$|Practices {{contrary}} to this interpretation, such as celebration of Muhammad's birthday and {{visits to the}} tombs of renowned Muslims, are discouraged. The spreading of Muslim teachings not in conformity with the officially accepted interpretation of Islam is prohibited. Writers and other individuals who publicly criticize this interpretation, including both those who advocate a stricter interpretation and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> a more moderate interpretation than the government's, have reportedly been imprisoned and faced other reprisals.|$|E

25|$|Historically, abortions {{have been}} done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other {{traditional}} methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> the legality of abortion often hold that a woman {{has a right to}} make decisions about her own body.|$|E
25|$|According to the OECD, Finland's {{job market}} is the least {{flexible}} of the Nordic countries. Finland increased job market regulation in the 1970s to provide stability to manufacturers. In contrast, during the 1990s, Denmark liberalised its job market, Sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas Finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. Many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down common terms of employment including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually {{as part of a}} Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices. Centralized agreements may hinder structural change as there are fewer incentives to acquire better skills, although Finland already enjoys one of the highest skill-levels in the world.|$|E
25|$|Discussions of the Southern Maya area as {{important}} if not {{essential to the}} rise of Classic Maya civilization and must be related to discussions of the putative primacy of developments in the Northern Petén, and vice versa. Fundamentally, the debate is between those who put more weight on the temporal priority of complex cultural and social achievements in the South and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> northern Guatemala for these developments. Large Preclassic cities with structures boasting the most massive scale in the ancient Maya world include El Mirador, Nakbe, Tintal, Wakna, and others from the Mirador Basin, north of the greatest Maya city in Classic times, Tikal. Without doubt, these cities represent an extraordinary development in Maya civilization; however, their dating remains essentially Late Preclassic, and scant evidence is found of two of the hallmark traits of Classic Maya civilization: upright carved shaft stones called stelae, which marked the birth of the cult of kingship, and hieroglyphic writing. While stelae and hieroglyphic writing from the Preclassic abound in the Southern area, proponents of the Lowlands, i.e., the Mirador Basin, as the origin locus for Maya civilization assert that the first Maya societies to reach the level of the state, accordingly, base their claim fundamentally on size and scale of construction, as well as on myriad evidence of distinct connections between these northern cities including even the sacbeob, the “white ways” or “high roads” that networked among them.|$|E

Municipal elections were fought over the issue, people were beaten and put into jail, and court cases were legion. A public speaker was threatened by a mob because he used a cuss word.

5000|$|Like his two {{immediate}} predecessors, {{the major}} issue confronting the Marks administration was the state's debt crisis, which had {{resulted from the}} gradual accumulation of bonded debt to pay for internal improvements and railroad construction over the previous four decades. The Panic of 1873 had greatly reduced property tax revenue, and the state had defaulted on its bond payments in 1875. [...] Furthermore, a Yellow Fever epidemic had decimated Memphis, putting more strains on the economy. [...] By the time Marks took office, his party had split into two factions - [...] <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favored</b> full repayment of the debt to protect the state's credit, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favored</b> only partial repayment.|$|R
500|$|Others {{have argued}} that the work was {{originally}} longer, with some hypothesizing that it comprised eight books. These individuals base their assertion on an AD 983 letter sent by Gerbertus Aureliacensis (later Pope SylvesterII) to the Archbishop of Rheims, in which the former reports that he had recently located [...] "eight volumes about astrology by Boethius" [...] (viii volumina Boetii de astrologia) at the abbey at Bobbio. Given that Boethius was often confused with Manilius (due to the fact that one of the former's names was [...] "Manlius"), <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> the idea that the poem was once longer argue that the manuscript at Bobbio was a misattributed but nonetheless eight-book version of the Astronomica. Goold repudiates this hypothesis, noting that the catalogue at Bobbio lists the work Gerbertus was likely referring to as comprising [...] "three books by Boethius about arithmetic, and the rest [...] about astronomy" [...] (libros Boetii iii de aritmetica [...] et alterum de astronomia). This, Goold contends, is evidence suggesting that Gerbertus found a single manuscript containing both Boethius's De arithmetica and Manilius's Astronomicanot an eight-book version of the latter.|$|E

In 1915, Kuno Meyer {{a professor at the}} University of Berlin who was considering a temporary Harvard appointment, protested the publication of an undergraduate's satirical poem in a college magazine. Lowell replied that freedom of speech played a different role in American universities than in their German counterparts. [...] "We have endeavored to maintain the right of all members of the university to express themselves freely, without censorship or supervision by the authorities of the university, and have applied this rule impartially to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> Germany and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> the Allies—to the former {{in the face of a}} pretty violent agitation for muzzling professors by alumni of the university and outsiders." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{connection}} between Colossians and Philemon, an undisputed letter, is significant. A certain Archippus {{is referred to}} in both ( [...] , [...] ), and the greetings of both letters bear similar names ( [...] , [...] ). However, the {{connection between}} the two epistles can be used by those {{on both sides of the}} Pauline vs. deutero-Pauline debate. To <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> Pauline authorship of Colossians, this is evidence of same authorship; to those who do not, this, combined with the other evidence noted, is indicative of a skillful forger.|$|E

But [...] "ven <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> the arbitration of securities claims do not contend, however, that arbitration has changed so significantly as {{to eliminate the}} essential characteristics noted by the Wilko Court," [...] he wrote. [...] "Indeed, proponents of arbitration would not see these characteristics as 'problems,' because, in their view, the characteristics permit the unique 'streamlined' nature of the arbitral process." [...] Arbitrators were still not required to keep records or follow legal precedent, and were discouraged from explaining their decisions. Nor had the scope of judicial review of arbitral awards been expanded since Wilko, he observed.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{much debate}} among historians about what drove the Viking expansion. One widely held {{idea is that}} it was a quest for {{retaliation}} against continental Europeans for their previous invasions of Viking homelands, such as Charlemagne's campaign to force Scandinavian pagans to convert to Christianity by killing any who refused to become baptized. The historian Rudolf Simek has observed, [...] "It is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne." [...] <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> this explanation point out that the penetration of Christianity into Scandinavia caused serious conflict and divided Norway for almost a century. However, the first target of Viking raids was not the Frankish Kingdom, but Christian monasteries in England, which seems inconsistent with vengeance as a motive but would be consistent with religious warfare.|$|E
2500|$|Until recently, {{the tale}} was {{forbidden}} reading in many Tibetan monasteries. In some monasteries, however, rituals invoking Gesar {{as a major}} spiritual force are performed. Given the central role the epic played over the centuries in Tibetan folk culture, Tibetan Buddhism has incorporated elements from it and interpreted them in religious terms. The Gelug school disapproved of the epic, while the Kagyu and Nyingma schools generally favoured it, seeing it {{as an expression of}} the activity of Padmasambhava and as a vehicle for Buddhist teachings, especially of the Dzogchen school. Consequentially, the question of whether babdrung (visionary Gesar bards) should be regarded as religious practitioners (...) will be answered differently by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> and those who oppose the epic; the babdrung [...] themselves, however, generally emphasize the connection of the epic with the Dharma (...) and see themselves as a kind of religious practitioner.|$|E
2500|$|Other authors make a {{distinction}} between the centre-right and the far-right. Parties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights and a limited welfare state (for example, government provision of education and medical care). They support conservatism and economic liberalism and oppose socialism and communism. By contrast, the phrase [...] "far-right" [...] by is used to describe <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> an absolutist government, which uses {{the power of the state}} to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and often to criminalize other ethnic groups or religions. Typical examples of leaders to whom the far-right label is often applied are Francisco Franco in Spain, Benito Mussolini in Italy, Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany and Augusto Pinochet in Chile. The United States Department of Homeland Security defines right-wing extremism as hate groups who target racial, ethnic or religious minorities and may be dedicated to a single issue. The phrase is also used to describe support for ethnic nationalism.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 April 1733, Henry Price of Boston was {{appointed}} Provincial Grand Master [...] "of New England" [...] by the Viscount Montagu, Grand Master of the Moderns' Grand Lodge in London. Clearly, this appointment {{would not have}} included Pennsylvania, except for Price's repeated, but disputed, claims that the Grand Master had [...] "ordered him to extend Freemasonry over all North America." [...] Price held this office until December 1736, when he was succeeded by Robert Tomlinson, also of Boston, who held the office {{until his death in}} 1740. Tomlinson was succeeded by Thomas Oxnard, who was deputized Provincial Grand Master [...] "for North America" [...] on 23 Sept. 1743. He remained in office until his death in 1754. Whether Price's office gave him jurisdiction over Pennsylvania Masonry has always been disputed, but the question, according to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>favor</b> the supremacy of Massachusetts, became a moot point for a brief period with Oxnard's appointment over all of North America. Historians who argue in favor of Massachuestts' primacy over Pennsylvania also point to an appointment of Benjamin Franklin as Provincial Grand Master for Pennsylvania on 10 July 1749. They argue that Provincial Grand Masters had no authority to appoint other Provincial Grand Masters and Franklin's appointment was void since only grand lodges had authority to do so. However, Daniel Coxe's deputation from the Grand Lodge of England did in fact provide the Freemasons in Pennsylvania to elect a Provincial Grand Master every two years in perpetuity. Because of this we can assume that all successive Provincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania were elected under the authority of this deputation.|$|E
