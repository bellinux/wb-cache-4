5|$|By the mid-1850s the {{miasma theory}} of disease was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and <b>their</b> <b>interactions</b> with {{other forms of}} life. By the 1880s, bacteriology was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and <b>their</b> <b>interactions.</b> Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E

Herbert discusses the most common interpretations of quantum mechanics and their consequences in turn, highlighting the conceptual advantages and drawbacks of each.|$|E

Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section.

The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters.

Reception to {{the characters in the}} series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of the characters and <b>their</b> <b>interactions</b> with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator pointed out that the women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making <b>their</b> <b>interactions</b> more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and <b>their</b> <b>interactions.</b> He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E

5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, <b>their</b> <b>interactions</b> with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt <b>their</b> <b>interactions</b> accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

5|$|Giles Darby, David Bermingham, and Gary Mulgrew {{worked for}} Greenwich NatWest. The three British men {{had worked with}} Fastow on a special purpose entity he had started called Swap Sub. When Fastow was being {{investigated}} by the SEC, the three men met with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) in November 2001 to discuss <b>their</b> <b>interactions</b> with Fastow. In June 2002, the U.S. issued warrants for their arrest on seven counts of wire fraud, and they were then extradited.

Coulbeck's death was eventually ruled to have been a suicide. The U.S. case alleged that Coulbeck and others conspired with Fastow. In a plea bargain in November 2007, the trio plead guilty to one count of wire fraud while the other six counts were dismissed. Darby, Bermingham, and Mulgrew were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. In August 2010, Bermingham and Mulgrew retracted their confessions.|$|E
