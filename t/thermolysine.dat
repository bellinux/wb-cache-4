40|$|In {{order to}} obtain a better {{understanding}} of the interaction between enzymes and substrates, quantum chemical methods (pseudopotentials) were used to calculate molecular structures, energies, electron densities and electrostatic potentials, and the results were represented by means of computer graphical methods. By the combination of quantum chemical and computer graphical methods the active site of the enzyme <b>thermolysine</b> has been modelled and studied.

40|$|AbstractA {{metalloprotease}} gene of Brevibacillus brevis (npr) {{was expressed}} in Escherichia coli in a soluble form as native Npr precursor. A significant {{fraction of the}} precursor was spontaneously processed, producing the N-terminal propeptide and the mature enzyme. A strong inhibition of the mature Npr by its own propeptide in the crude lysate was observed {{even in the absence}} of the covalent linkage between them. Pure precursor, propeptide and the mature Npr were isolated and kinetic parameters of the mature enzyme inhibition by the propeptide were determined. The inhibition is of the tight-binding competitive type with Ki 0. 17 nM. Inhibition of metalloproteases from Brevibacillus megaterium and <b>thermolysine</b> by the heterologous propeptide of the Npr from B. brevis was much weaker or none...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{amino acid}} sequence of the basic nuclear protein of bull spermatozoa has been established. The sequence was partially deduced by characterization of peptides isolated from <b>thermolysine</b> and chymotryptic digests of the reduced and S-aminoethylated protein. The complete sequence of the first 37 residues was determined by Edman Begg degradation (Sequenator) of the protein. The {{amino acid sequence}} of the last 8 residues was determined by manual Edman degradation of an octapeptide obtained on cleavage of the reduced and S-methylated protein with N-bromosuccinimide. The basic nuclear protein of bull spermatozoa contains 47 amino acid residues with alanine at the amino terminus and glutamine at the carboxyl terminus. The protein contains 24 arginine residues and 6 half-cystine residues. 19 of the arginine residues {{are in the middle}} of the molecule, arranged in three clusters of, respectively, 7, 6 and 6 residues. Of the 6 half-cystine residues 2 are present in the amino-terminal region and 2 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule. The half-cystine residues are responsible for the cross-linking of the deoxyribonucleoprotein molecules which gives the mature sperm nucleus an unusual resistance towards chemical and mechanical damage. The complete amino acid sequence is: H 2 N-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Arg-(Cys) 2 -Leu-Thr His Ser-Gly-Ser-Arg-Cys-(Arg) 7 -Cys-(Arg) 5 -Phe-Gly-(Arg) 5 -Val-Cys-Tyr-Thr- Val-Ile-Arg-Cys-Thr-Arg-Gln...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{structural}} {{similarity between}} {{low molecular weight}} protamine (LMWP), prepared by enzymatic digestion of protamine, and HIV-TAT protein transduction peptide suggested the feasibility of LMWP as an efficient carrier for delivering therapeutic genes while alleviating the cytotoxicity of currently employed gene carriers. Methods LMWP was prepared by enzymatic digestion of protamine with <b>thermolysine.</b> The prepared LMWP peptide and TAT peptide, {{as well as their}} complexes with plasmid DNA (pDNA), were examined for cellular uptake behaviors by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The complexation of pDNA and LMWP was monitored by gel retardation test as well as size and zeta potential measurements, and was then further assessed by DNase I protection assay. The transfection efficiency of pDNA/LMWP was examined by varying the pDNA content and charge ratio in the complex, and then compared with that of pDNA/PEI. Cytotoxicity induced by pDNA/LMWP and pDNA/PEI was also examined. Results Prepared LMWP showed similar transcellular localization behavior and kinetics to those of TAT, and efficiently transferred the pDNA into nucleus and cytoplasm in a short time period. The size and zeta potential of the pDNA/LMWP complex were 120 nm and 30 mV, respectively, which were adequately suitable for cellular uptake. After forming the complex, LMWP appeared to effectively protect pDNA against DNase I attack. The pDNA/LMWP complex showed significantly enhanced gene transfer than both naked pDNA and the pDNA/PEI complex, while exhibiting a markedly reduced cytotoxicity than that of the pDNA/PEI complex. Conclusions The present study suggested that LMWP could be a useful and safe tool for enhancing delivery of bioactive molecules and therapeutic DNA products into cells when applied in gene therapy.

40|$|Background: Different {{methods have}} been used in order to isolate dental pulp stem cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} study the effect of {{different}} types of pulp treatment during isolation, under 3 % O 2 conditions, in the time needed and the efficacy for obtaining dental pulp stem cells. Material and Methods: One hundred and twenty dental pulps were used to isolate dental pulp stem cells treating the pulp tissue during isolation using 9 different methods, using digestive, disgregation, or mechanical agents, or combining them. The cells were positive for CD 133, Oct 4, Nestin, Stro- 1, CD 34 markers, and negative for the hematopoietic cell marker CD- 45, thus confirming the presence of mesenchymal stem cells. The efficacy of dental pulp stem cells obtention and the minimum time needed to obtain such cells comparing the 9 different methods was analyzed. Results: Dental pulp stem cells were obtained from 97 of the 120 pulps used in the study, i. e. 80. 8 % of the cases. They were obtained with all the methods used except with mechanical fragmentation of the pulp, where no enzymatic digestion was performed. The minimum time needed to isolate dental pulp stem cells was 8 hours, digesting with 2 mg/ml EDTA for 10 minutes, 4 mg/ml of type I collagenase, 4 mg/ml of type II dispase for 40 minutes, 13 ng/ ml of <b>thermolysine</b> for 40 minutes and sonicating the culture for one minute. Conclusions: Dental pulp stem cells were obtained in 97 cases from a series of 120 pulps. The time for obtaining dental pulp stem cells was reduced maximally, without compromising the obtention of the cells, by combining digestive, disgregation, and mechanical agent...|$|E
