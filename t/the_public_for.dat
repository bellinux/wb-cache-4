40|$|The Slovenian {{government}} aims {{to regulate}} prices for medicinal products {{to manage and}} reduce <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products. This paper aims to investigate the association between the regulated wholesale prices of medicinal products and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products, and to estimate regression model <b>for</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products in the non hospital consumption. In the empirical research are included 758 regulated prices for medicinal products prescribed by the outpatients’ department on a prescription (Rp) during the years 2003 – 2010, which are financed from <b>public</b> expenditures. <b>The</b> correlation and regression analyses are used {{in order to establish}} the association between the regulated wholesale prices for medicinal products and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products. The correlation analysis confirmed a strong positive correlation of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products with the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, a weak correlation with the wholesale prices for medicinal products and with the classification lists of medicinal products. The multiple regression analysis confirmed a positive significant impact of the wholesale price of medicinal products and the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, on <b>the</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products. The research has confirmed the association of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products with the regulated wholesale prices for medicinal products. It has underlined the importance of the rational prescription and use of medicinal products. The explanatory variables included in the regression model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products explained up to 94 % of variability in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal products...|$|R

5|$|Altrincham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} North West England with an ice rink, and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham Ice Rink was built in Broadheath. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham Ice Rink closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until {{construction}} of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham Ice Dome was completed. Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the Ice Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's MEN Arena. In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix English National Ice Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into use. When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>for</b> ice skating.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>for</b> the next year and a half.|$|E

Cricket matches between the club and local teams from Ickenham and Uxbridge were played within the grounds. The house was bought by three local residents in the 1980s and restored, whereupon it was leased to Bristol-Myers Squibb for 25 years.
