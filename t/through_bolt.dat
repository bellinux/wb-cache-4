50|$|Cross-bolting has two advantages: it couples the {{two sides}} of the {{crankcase}} together, making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting. Secondly it helps to hold the bearing cap down against the downward force from the piston.

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most bearing caps are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single <b>through</b> <b>bolt</b> passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the bearing cap from each side.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of externally bonded sprayed {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (Sprayed GFRP) in shear strengthening of RC beams under quasi-static loading is investigated. Different techniques were utilized {{to enhance the}} bond between concrete and Sprayed GFRP, involving the use of <b>through</b> <b>bolts</b> and nuts paired with concrete surface preparation through sandblasting and {{through the use of a}} pneumatic chisel prior to Sprayed GFRP application. It was found that roughening the concrete surface using a pneumatic chisel and using <b>through</b> <b>bolts</b> and nuts were the most effective techniques. Also, Sprayed GFRP applied on 3 sides (U-shaped) was found to be more effective than 2 -sided Sprayed GFRP in shear strengthening. Sprayed GFRP increased the shear load-carrying capacity and energy absorption capacities of RC beams. It was found that the load-carrying capacity of strengthened RC beams was related to an effective strain of applied Sprayed GFRP. This strain was related to Sprayed GFRP configuration and the technique used to enhance the concrete-FRP bond. Finally, an equation was proposed to calculate the contribution of Sprayed GFRP in the shear strength of an RC beam...|$|R

With double channel beams and HSS columns interconnected by bearing-type high-strength bolts, all specimens showed an story drift capacity significantly larger than 0. 04 radian. Typical response is characterized by a linear response, a slip range, followed by a significant hardening region due to bolt bearing. Three failure modes were identified. Confining in the connection region, inelastic action <b>through</b> <b>bolt</b> slippage and bearing is ductile and desirable. Such inelastic action always occurs first, but either column or beam may also experience buckling. Beam buckling is most undesirable due to significant post-buckling strength degradation.

40|$|This thesis investigates, {{with the}} use of finite element method, the stress {{formation}} in a big-end bolt during the power stroke in an IC piston engine. The method used is quasi-static analysis of {{the lower part of the}} connection rod (big-end) assembly for different time intervals during the stroke. Two big end configurations is analyzed with the aim of finding regions in the bolt with stress concentrating feature that could induce fatigue. The simulation is, performed with Abaqus FEA software. The results is, compared with previous performed studies, industrial reports and hand calculations. Supported by literature, the results shows that the combination of reduced area due to thread curvature, and forces <b>through</b> <b>bolt</b> from power stroke creates high stresses. The weakest part of the bolt is the first thread, as this carries most of the load. Future work will include improving the FE model and performing FE analysis on other configurations.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the preload loss and bacterial penetration through the implant-abutment interface of conical and external hexagon connection systems subjected to thermal cycling and mechanical fatigue (TM). Four different implant-abutment connection systems were evaluated (n= 6) : external hexagon with universal post, Morse taper with universal post, Morse taper with universal post <b>through</b> <b>bolt,</b> and locking taper with standard abutment.

The assemblies were immersed in Tryptic Soy + Yeast Extract broth containing Streptococcus sanguinis and incubated at 37 °C and 10 % CO 2 for 72 h. Detorque values were recorded. The bacterial penetration was assessed and the abutments were observed by scanning electron microscopy. The preload data were analyzed statistically by two-way ANOVA and Tukey&# 8217;s test at 5 % significance level. All screw abutment systems showed significantly higher (p< 0. 05) detorque values when subjected to TM and all conical systems presented bacterial penetration.

The objective of this thesis is to devise a method to determine the residual strength of used creosote treated timber railroad bridge piles of various dimensions that have been subjected to varying degrees of environmental and mechanical deterioration. A total of 37 timber piles from three different locations were used for experimentation. Upon receipt, the piles were assigned an identification number and then stripped of any extraneous material such as wood blocks, drift pins, metal strapping, erection spikes, and metal bolts. The piles were then inspected for any form of pretest damage including, but not limited to, longitudinal cracking, fire damage, rot, decay, adequacy of creosote penetration, and general fitness of the wood. The piles were tested in uniaxial compression parallel to the grain in a custom built frame with a capacity of 1. 8 million pounds. Data taken from the testing included the applied load and three separate measurements of axial deformation. Testing for each specimen was terminated when any of the following occurred: longitudinal splitting {{along the length of the}} specimen, longitudinal splitting along the length of the specimen <b>through</b> <b>bolt</b> holes, localized barreling of the cross-section, lateral buckling, mushrooming of the butt or tip end, and/or manual termination due to failure to sustain load. A correlation was discovered between a two part pile strength parameter, [], and the ultimate test load, P[max]. The pile strength parameter consists of the axial stiffness as determined from a plot of load vs. deflection for each pile and a slenderness parameter obtainable from simple measurements as the square of the pile tip diameter divided by length. A least squares linear regression analysis was performed on a plot of the ultimate load from each test, P[max], vs. the pile strength parameter, [], for each test. Uniaxial compression tests of small clearwood samples of different species were similarly tested to determine potential limits of the pile strength parameter approach. This method of determining residual pile capacity is simple in concept and can be used in the field to determine remaining axial strength of in-service piles...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{transient}} {{behavior of}} structures with bolted joints when subjected {{to medium and}} high shock or impact loads can be challenging due to their nonlinear response, which is induced by the complex interactions between the bolts and the structure. While few researchers have considered shock transmission <b>through</b> <b>bolted</b> joints at low impact loading, there are little literature on shock transmission <b>through</b> <b>bolted</b> joints under high loading conditions. Low impact loading condition generally excites the lower order frequencies but under high impact loading higher order frequencies are excited. Typical factors that affect the response of a bolted joint include, preload (bolt tightening), intensity of the impact, and damping within the joint. The complexity in designing bolted joints under these conditions lies in the limitations of available methods to characterize their behavior. The main objective of this work is to develop computational tools for predicting the shock transmission <b>through</b> <b>bolted</b> joints under medium and high impacts. Examples of these impacts are blast loading and projectile impact. The effect of tightening torque of the bolts on the response is also studied. The strain rate effect of the bolts due to high impact loading is also studied. The study is done in two steps. The first step is a high impact study on a square flange system using a Two-stage gas gun. A steel plate is impacted using Lexan polycarbonate projectile at around 6 km/s. The impact surface is penetrated by the projectile on impact. The response acceleration is measured post joint. The second step would be to study medium impacts on a bolted connection using a circular fixture with a bolted lid to replicate a vessel. This structure is subjected to impact loading in a drop tower. The experiment is conducted at different pre-load torque for the bolts. The bolts are subjected to plastic deformation. The responses are measured using an accelerometer and a force sensor. For these two cases, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is performed. The bolts are modeled as solid elements. In both of these cases, strain rate effect is considered for both the structure and bolts. For high impact study using Two-stage gas gun, the impact region is modeled using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) technique and Lagrangian method is used for rest of the material. The simulation and experimental results from both cases are compared {{using a combination of}} Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) ...|$|R
