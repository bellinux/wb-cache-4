50|$|For example, the {{equation}} x + y = 2x - 1 is solved for the unknown x by the solution x = y + 1, because substituting y + 1 for x in {{the equation}} results in (y + 1) + y = 2(y + 1) - 1, a true statement. It is also possible to take the variable y to be the unknown, and then the equation is solved by y = x - 1. Or x and y can both be treated as unknowns, and then <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>solutions</b> to the equation. (x, y) = (a + 1, a) is a symbolic solution. Instantiating a symbolic solution with specific numbers always gives a numerical solution; for example, a = 0 gives (x, y) = (1, 0) (that is, x = 1 and y = 0) and a = 1 gives (x, y) = (2, 1). Note that the distinction between known variables and unknown variables {{is made in the}} statement of the problem, rather than the equation. However, in some areas of mathematics the convention is to reserve some variables as known and others as unknown. When writing polynomials, the coefficients are usually taken to be known and the indeterminates to be unknown, but depending on the problem, all variables may assume either role.|$|E
