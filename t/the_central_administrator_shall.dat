40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} study the patterns of perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> involved in the 1978 Tucson Unified School District teacher strike. The theoretical framework developed for this study, {{which was based on}} perceptual psychology, included the following areas: (1) perception; (2) empathy; (3) adequacy/self-concept; (4) relationships; (5) stress; and (6) perceptual framework. An interview schedule was developed based on the theoretical framework. The schedule utilized a Likert-type attitudinal scale as well as an open-ended comment format. Quantitative data were collected based on the principals' responses to the scale items. Qualitative data were based on comments on each of the scale items. Twenty-one <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> who were in those positions {{at the time of the}} strike were interviewed in-depth regarding their perceptions on the following aspects of the strike: (1) issues and causes; (2) relationships; (3) stress; (4) post-strike views.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was designed}} to gain insight in <b>the</b> area of <b>central</b> office instructional leadership support from {{the perception of the}} high school principal. With increasing standards and high student performance expectations coupled with strict federal and state accountability measures, it is impossible for the high school principal to bear the sole responsibility of meeting the needs of their students, staff, and community without further support. Central office is a critical factor in school improvement. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} provide insight and a deep understanding how successful high school principals feel supported as the instructional leader specifically in the area of planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The research was guided by a single overarching question: What are high school principal perceptions of support given to them by district <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> in <b>the</b> areas of planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum? Qualitative research was selected for this study to allow for deep and thorough investigation of a small group of high school principals' beliefs regarding <b>the</b> <b>central</b> office <b>administrator</b> instructional leadership support. Interviews were conducted with six successful high school principals from three large school districts. The findings that emerged from the interviews were categorized into eight themes including: the school district focus; instructional leader toolbox; effective use of data; deployment of curriculum and instruction; quality professional development; collaboration; connections; and communication. A synthesis of participants' responses and prior research lead to three overall conclusions: setting high learning expectations; focusing on curriculum and instruction; and establishing district-campus partnerships.

The emerging research warns that improvements in student achievement will fail to reach the majority of the schools and can rarely be sustained without substantial involvement from <b>the</b> <b>central</b> office. Utilizing a synthesis of the current research, a theoretical framework and related survey instrument addressing current leadership roles and responsibilities of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> office <b>administrator</b> in <b>the</b> improvement of student achievement were developed. Principals in a large, urban district completed the 55 -item survey instrument. To further explore perceptions, a focus group was conducted.    In order to determine internal consistency reliability, Cronbach's Alpha or Reliability Coefficient was computed for each of the domains on the survey. The results of Cronbach's Alpha Test for Reliability ranged from. 706 to. 855, which fell within the adequate to good range. The total numbers, percentages, and frequency distributions for responses on the survey instrument were calculated for each of the statements, as well as the thematic domains. In addition, Fisher's exact tests were conducted to determine if there were relationships in responses for principals in schools that made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and principals in schools that did not make AYP.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversitySchool {{district}} central offices {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} important actors {{in the implementation of}} new education policy initiatives. This qualitative case study focuses on the ways in which <b>the</b> <b>central</b> office in a mid-sized school district supported school principals in implementing newly adopted teacher and principal evaluation criteria. The study examined how <b>the</b> school district's <b>central</b> office supported principals in their planning, preparation, and implementation of the new teacher and principal evaluation system (TPEP) in Washington State. Two research questions guided the completion of this research study: (a) What types of activities took place between <b>the</b> <b>central</b> office and <b>the</b> principals; and (b) Did the principals perceive these activities as helpful to their pursuit of effective implementation of the TPEP initiative in their school buildings? The findings highlight <b>the</b> importance of <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> as boundary spanners in supporting the principals' development as leaders who have the capacity to enact the new evaluation criteria. Two themes emerged from interviews, observations and the review of documents. First, the use of existing district structures and relationships to support implementation at the school level was vital to the successful adoption of the evaluation criteria. This included working together as partners during the implementation and using common language from previous work within the district to achieve broadly shared understanding of the evaluation requirements. The second theme highlighted <b>the</b> importance of <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> providing everyday support to school principals. Everyday support included providing meaningful professional development; engaging in regular meetings; working and learning with the school administrators; and engaging in constant, consistent communication about the implementation of the policy. Collectively, the findings highlight how important it is that <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> consistently review their leadership practices with principals to ensure that they are providing meaningful structures and support. Further research on the ways in which <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> support principals is needed. In particular, research that focuses on how <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> measure their own practices relative to principal needs is urgently needed. Such consideration is particularly important as new policy initiatives demand that <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> create and establish effective support for school principals.
