5|$|After {{reviewing}} Hamdan's habeas petition, Judge James Robertson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia {{ruled in}} the detainee's favor. He found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> not hold a military commission {{unless it was}} first shown that the detainee was not a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, McKinley and Hay {{engaged in}} {{negotiations}} with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn. Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E

50|$|Finally, if Japan {{entered the}} war, {{military}} {{strategy in the}} Far East would be defensive. Although the ABC-1 agreement was not a military alliance, it nevertheless signified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> was preparing to enter the war {{on the side of}} <b>the</b> Allied powers, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> would make every effort to maintain the security of the British Commonwealth, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> military was modifying existing war plans (e.g. the RAINBOW plans) to incorporate military integration and cooperation with other nations.|$|R

25|$|The Carranza {{government}} was recognized de jure by the United States on 31 August 1917 {{as a direct}} consequence of the Zimmermann telegram, since recognition was necessary to ensure Mexican neutrality in World War I. After the military invasion of Veracruz in 1914, Mexico would not participate in any military excursions with the United States in World War I, thus ensuring Mexican neutrality was the best outcome <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> hope for, even if Mexican neutrality would allow German companies to keep their operations in Mexico open.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, when Aspin became {{chairman}} of the Armed Services Committee, he was recognized as a leading defense authority. His chairmanship caused controversy among some House Democrats, particularly because he supported the Reagan administration's policies on the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Although temporarily removed from his committee chair by his Democratic colleagues in January 1987, Aspin weathered the crisis and regained the chairmanship three weeks later. He again broke with many Democrats in January 1991 when he issued a paper supporting the Bush administration's intention {{to use military force}} to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. The accuracy of his prediction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> win a quick military victory with light casualties added to his reputation as a military expert.|$|E
25|$|The unpopular war in Iraq was a {{key issue}} during the {{campaign}} before the economic crisis. John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it (Obama's early and strong {{opposition to the war}} helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign). Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II, his statement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly. Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.|$|E

25|$|Filibustering {{continued}} to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of Franklin Pierce, a filibustering effort by John A. Quitman to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off, however, and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130million. When the public learned of the Ostend Manifesto in 1854, which argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 the Sandinista {{government}} filed a suit in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{against the}} United States (Nicaragua v. United States), {{which resulted in}} a 1986 judgment against the United States. The ICJ held that the U.S. had violated international law by supporting the contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua's harbors. Regarding the alleged human rights violations by the contras, however, the ICJ took the view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> only be held accountable for them if it would have been proven that the U.S. had effective control of the contra operations resulting in these alleged violations. Nevertheless, the ICJ found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law by producing the manual Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare (Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas) and disseminating it to the contras. The manual, amongst other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians and recommended to hire professional killers for specific selective tasks.|$|E

The Court found the Congress had no constitutional authority to subject servicemen's dependents to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and overturned the convictions.

500|$|When the Kennedy {{administration}} entered {{office in}} 1961, the U.S. Department of Defense {{was instructed to}} find an inexpensive fighter aircraft <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> offer to its allies through the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. A number of designs were studied, including stripped-down versions of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Vought F-8 Crusader, and the newly designed Northrop N-156F. On 23 April 1962, the United States Air Force (USAF) informed the United States Secretary of Defense that the N-156F had been selected, under the designation F-5 and given the name [...] "Freedom Fighter."

500|$|Receiving counsel from Alexander Hamilton, who cautioned the {{president}} that [...] "we forget how little we can annoy", Washington became convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> not further antagonize Great Britain; he feared the possibility of British-imposed commercial isolation, which would precipitate an economic catastrophe that would [...] "overturn the constitution and put into an overwhelming majority the anti-national forces". At the same time, radical government elements led by Thomas Jefferson had all but declared their support for U.S. aid to the beleaguered French First Republic (then {{at war with the}} United Kingdom). The Anglophile Hamilton, Jefferson mused, was [...] "panic-struck if we refuse our breach to every kick which Great Britain may choose to give it".|$|E
500|$|During {{the time}} the United States was the most {{dominant}} in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc. Food Power was not really thought about. [...] However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food {{has come to the}} surface. In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged. The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food. [...] While others nations, predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil-exporting nations, are beginning to have food shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States, giving it more and more power. This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food. [...] It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries. Even some of the poorest OPEC countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat. Therefore, there is a possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> restrict its food exports for political purposes. [...] The United States could use this Food power as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries. [...] Food power will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate.|$|E

500|$|R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (2000), {{was a case}} {{concerning}} the forcible removal of the indigenous people of the Chagos Archipelago from Diego Garcia and the prohibition of their return by the Government of the United Kingdom so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> construct a large military base there. This was effected by section 4 of the Immigration Ordinance 1971 of the British Indian Ocean Territory enacted pursuant to section 11(1) of the British Indian Ocean Territory Order, which states: [...] "The Commissioner [...] may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, and such laws shall be published in such manner as the Commissioner may direct." [...] The High Court held that the 1971 Ordinance was ultra vires the Order, since removing a people from their homeland could not be regarded as within {{the power to make}} laws for the territory's [...] "peace, order and good government". Subsequently, the exclusion of the Chagossians from the land was reimposed by an Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, which was made in the exercise of the royal prerogative. The legality of this Order was upheld by the House of Lords in R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) (2008), which overruled the earlier decision. The House of Lords took the view that the phrase [...] "peace, order and good government" [...] did not entitle the courts to substitute their own view on what the phrase required for that of the Government. Laws made pursuant to it were therefore not justiciable.|$|E
