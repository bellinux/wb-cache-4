5000|$|Closed-end funds {{generally}} issue {{shares to}} the public only once, when they are created through an initial public offering. <b>Their</b> <b>shares</b> are then listed for trading on a stock exchange. Investors who want to sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> must sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to another investor in the market; they cannot sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> back to the fund. The price that investors receive for <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> may be significantly different from NAV; it may be at a [...] "premium" [...] to NAV (i.e., higher than NAV) or, more commonly, at a [...] "discount" [...] to NAV (i.e., lower than NAV).|$|R

5000|$|In {{investment}} banking, {{the term}} [...] "securities lending" [...] {{is also used}} to describe a service offered to large investors who can allow the investment bank to lend out <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to other people. This is often done to investors of all sizes who have pledged <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to borrow money to buy more shares, but large investors like pension funds often choose to do this to <b>their</b> unpledged <b>shares</b> because they will receive interest income. In these types of agreements, the investor still receives any dividends as normal, the only thing they cannot generally do is to vote <b>their</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R

5|$|A reboot of the series, with Bond winning his 00 {{status in}} the pre-credits sequence. Bond is {{instructed}} to investigate the funding of terrorism. He tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, {{and then on to}} financer Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre's investments involve short-selling stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist attacks to sink <b>their</b> <b>share</b> prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype Skyfleet airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale to recoup his fortune. Bond is instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd.|$|E

5|$|Greek epigrams {{contribute}} <b>their</b> <b>share</b> in Pliny's {{descriptions of}} pictures and statues. One {{of the minor}} authorities for books XXXIV–XXXV is Heliodorus of Athens, {{the author of a}} work on the monuments of Athens. In the indices to XXXIII–XXXVI, an important place is assigned to Pasiteles of Naples, the author of a work in five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating the substance of the earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by Kalkmann, who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of Apollodorus of Athens, as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:173, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).|$|E

5|$|QPR's {{victory was}} the first {{occasion}} a team from the Third Division had won a major trophy in England. Both teams received £18,000 as <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of the gate receipts.

However, the Fairs Cup committee required that only teams from the highest tier of a nation's league system could enter. In the end, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Liverpool qualified for the following season's competition.|$|E

5|$|While rejecting Danish authority, Olaf made it {{his mission}} to convert Norway and the Norse colonies in the west as quickly and as {{completely}} as possible. Proceeding with threats, torture and executions, Olaf broke down pagan resistance {{and within a few}} years Norway was, at least nominally, a Christian country. But King Olaf had acquired several enemies during his meteoric rise to power. The most prominent were Eirik Jarl, son of Haakon Jarl, and Svein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, both of whom felt that Olaf had deprived them of <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of Norway.|$|E
5|$|While the {{air cargo}} {{industry}} in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% {{in the fiscal}} year 2003–04, Biman's cargo operations remained stagnant when private operators such as Bismillah Airlines, Best Aviation and Air Bangladesh produced a 108% growth from the previous year. The private operators increased <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of the cargo market by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4.6% and 6.0% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29%.|$|E
5|$|While {{the team}} was a success, Willis and Motley contended with <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field {{incidents}} also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to {{a game against the}} Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where {{the team was}} staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|At Union Station, {{the cars}} are loaded onto a train car {{with the help of}} Wrench. Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants {{to spend the rest of}} his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{received}} 15,000 {{tickets for}} the final from the Football Association. Birmingham distributed <b>their</b> <b>share</b> by ballot among those supporters who had followed the team in the earlier rounds of the competition; 22,000 had attended the semi-final, so many thousands were left disappointed. Of the remaining tickets, 4,640 were allocated to the FA, 40,640 to County Associations, 20,090 to Football League clubs, 2,550 to FA members and 2,080 to the FA Council and stadium authorities. An enquiry into the black market held following the previous year's Cup Final meant ticket touts kept a lower profile than usual.
