25|$|In science, one of {{the most}} famous members of the Cypriniformes is the {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio). The zebrafish is {{one of the}} most important vertebrate model organisms in biological and biochemical sciences, being used in many kinds of experiment. As, during early development, the zebrafish has a nearly <b>transparent</b> <b>body,</b> it is ideal for studying developmental biology. It is also used for the elucidation of biochemical signaling pathways. They are also good pets, but can be shy in bright light and crowded tanks.|$|E
25|$|In Chamber of Secrets, Nick is {{a victim}} of the Basilisk that Ginny Weasley unleashes under the {{influence}} of Tom Riddle. The stare of the Basilisk is lethal to anyone who looks it directly in the eye. All of its living victims meet its gaze indirectly, either from a reflection or by seeing it through something else, and are only petrified rather than killed. Nick is the only one to look directly at the Basilisk, but he too is petrified since he is a ghost and cannot die again. Nick also protected Hufflepuff student Justin Finch-Fletchley from death after Justin saw the basilisk's eyes through Nick's <b>transparent</b> <b>body,</b> thus only petrifying him as well.|$|E

500|$|Some tissues such as muscles {{can be made}} transparent, {{provided}} {{either they}} are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. Familiar examples of <b>transparent</b> <b>body</b> parts are the lens and cornea of the vertebrate eye. The lens is made of the protein crystallin; the cornea is made of the protein collagen. Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the retinas or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light {{to be able to}} function. The camera-type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque. Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the nematocysts (stinging cells) of the transparent siphonophore Agalma okenii resemble small copepods. Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of larvae, including coelenterates, siphonophores, salps (floating tunicates), gastropod molluscs, polychaete worms, many shrimplike crustaceans, and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live. Adult comb jellies and jellyfish are mainly transparent, like their watery background. The small Amazon river fish Microphilypnus amazonicus and the shrimps it associates with, Pseudopalaemon gouldingi, are so transparent as to be [...] "almost invisible"; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled (disruptively patterned) according to the local background in the environment.|$|E
60|$|And whereas {{it may be}} objected, {{that the}} {{propagation}} of light is no argument that there are those atomical pores in glass, since there are Hypotheses plausible enough to solve those Phænomena, by supposing the pulse onely to be communicated through the <b>transparent</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
60|$|Third: Clear water {{takes no}} shadow, {{and that for}} two reasons; A perfect surface of {{speculum}} metal takes no shadow, (this the reader may instantly demonstrate for himself,) and a perfectly <b>transparent</b> <b>body</b> as air takes no shadow; hence water, whether transparent or reflective, takes no shadow.|$|E
60|$|Those Surfaces of <b>transparent</b> <b>Bodies,</b> {{which if}} the Ray be in a Fit of Refraction do refract it most strongly, if the Ray be in a Fit of Reflexion do reflect it most easily.|$|R
60|$|Those Superficies of <b>transparent</b> <b>Bodies</b> {{reflect the}} {{greatest}} quantity of Light, {{which have the}} greatest refracting Power; that is, which intercede Mediums that differ most in their refractive Densities. And in the Confines of equally refracting Mediums there is no Reflexion.|$|R
60|$|The {{reason why}} the Surfaces of all thick <b>transparent</b> <b>Bodies</b> reflect part of the Light {{incident}} on them, and refract the rest, is, that some Rays at their Incidence are in Fits of easy Reflexion, and others in Fits of easy Transmission.|$|R
60|$|Obs. 22. A thin <b>transparent</b> <b>Body,</b> {{which is}} denser than its ambient Medium, {{exhibits}} more brisk and vivid Colours {{than that which}} is so much rarer; as I have particularly observed in the Air and Glass. For blowing Glass very thin at a Lamp Furnace, those Plates encompassed with Air did exhibit Colours much more vivid than those of Air made thin between two Glasses.|$|E
60|$|And {{therefore}} secondly, the laminated body must be transparent, {{and this}} I argue from this, that I {{have not been}} able to produce any colour at all with an opacous body, though never so thin. And this I have often try'd, by pressing small Globule of Mercury between two smooth Plates of Glass, whereby I have reduc'd that body to a much greater thinness then was requisite to exhibit the colours with a <b>transparent</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Transparency: a {{state or}} quality of body which permits all rays of light to pass through," [...] he defined for me. [...] "That is what I am seeking. Lloyd blunders up against the shadow with his perfect opaqueness. But I escape it. A <b>transparent</b> <b>body</b> casts no shadow; neither does it reflect light-waves--that is, the {{perfectly}} transparent does not. So, avoiding high lights, not only will such a body cast no shadow, but, since it reflects no light, {{it will also be}} invisible." ...|$|E
50|$|They have {{translucent}} or <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{and lack}} any scales. The head is strongly depressed and has numerous teeth. The adults {{are believed to}} be neotenic, retaining some larval features. For example, the skeleton is not fully ossified, consisting largely of cartilage. They are small fish, typically around 8 cm, with the largest species reaching only 16 cm.|$|R
60|$|And hence Light is in Fits of easy Reflexion {{and easy}} Transmission, before its Incidence on <b>transparent</b> <b>Bodies.</b> And {{probably}} it {{is put into}} such fits at its first emission from luminous Bodies, and continues in them during all its progress. For these Fits are of a lasting nature, as will appear by the next part of this Book.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} species are used as {{aquarium}} fish, noted for their <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies.</b> The Indian glassy fish, Parambassis ranga, is a colorful fish, but showier specimens that had been injected with artificial coloring were sold as novelty pets in the 1990s. Since then these [...] "painted fish" [...] have become much less popular, with more fishkeepers seeking naturally pigmented specimens.|$|R
60|$|By Density and Rarity, I {{understand}} a property of a <b>transparent</b> <b>body,</b> that does either {{more or less}} refract a Ray of light (coming obliquely upon its superficies out of a third medium) toward its perpendicular: As I call Glass a more dense body then Water, and Water a more rare body then Glass, because of the refractions (more or less deflecting towards the perpendicular) that are made in them, of a Ray of light out of the Air that has the same inclination upon either of their superficies.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hughs {{laid the}} baby down, and, {{going to the}} {{cupboard}} where all the household gods were kept, brought out two old, dirty saucers. Martin raised the plants, and as he held them, from one close, yellow petal there rose up a tiny caterpillar. It reared a green, <b>transparent</b> <b>body,</b> feeling {{its way to a}} new resting-place. The little writhing shape seemed, like the wonder and the mystery of life, to mock the young doctor, who watched it with eyebrows raised, having no hand at liberty to remove it from the plant.|$|E
60|$|The other Instance we have, is in Animal bodies, as in Pearls, Mother of Pearl-shels, Oyster-shels, {{and almost}} all other kinds of stony shels whatsoever. This have I also {{sometimes}} with pleasure observ'd even in Muscles and Tendons. Further, if you take any glutinous substance and run it exceedingly thin upon {{the surface of a}} smooth glass or a polisht metaline body, you shall find the like effects produced: and in general, wheresoever you meet with a <b>transparent</b> <b>body</b> thin enough, that is terminated by reflecting bodies of differing refractions from it, there will be a production of these pleasing and lovely colours.|$|E
6000|$|Since {{therefore}} we find by other proofs, {{that many of}} those bodies which we think the most solid ones, and appear so to our sight, have notwithstanding abundance of those grosser kind of pores, which will admit several kinds of liquors into them, why should we not believe that Glass, and all other <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies</b> abound with them, since we have many other arguments, besides the propagation of light, which seem to argue for it? ...|$|R

5000|$|Alhazen's work {{included}} the conjecture that [...] "Light travels through <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies</b> in straight lines only", {{which he was}} able to corroborate only after years of effort. He stated, [...] "This is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes. ... the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air." [...] He also demonstrated the conjecture by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam.|$|R
60|$|Now, if A2 be {{supposed}} {{to represent the}} Thickness of any thin <b>transparent</b> <b>Body,</b> at which the outmost Violet is most copiously reflected in the first Ring, or Series of Colours, then by the 13th Observation, HK will represent its Thickness, at which the utmost Red is most copiously reflected in the same Series. Also by the 5th and 16th Observations, A6 and HN will denote the Thicknesses at which those extreme Colours are most copiously reflected in the second Series, and A10 and HQ the Thicknesses at which they are most copiously reflected in the third Series, and so on. And the Thickness at which any of the intermediate Colours are reflected most copiously, will, according to the 14th Observation, be defined by {{the distance of the}} Line AH from the intermediate parts of the Lines 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c. against which the Names of those Colours are written below.|$|E
60|$|This I should further {{proceed to}} hope, had any one been so {{inquisitive}} {{as to have}} found out the way of making any <b>transparent</b> <b>body,</b> either more dense or more rare, for then {{it might be possible}} to compose a Globule that should be more dense in the middle of it, then in any other part, and to compose the whole bulk, so as that there should be a continual gradual transition from one degree of density to another; such as should be found requisite for the desired inflection of the transmigrating Rays; but of this enough at present, because I may say more of it when I set down my own Trials concerning the melioration of Dioptricks, where I shall enumerate with how many several substances I have made both Microscopes, and Telescopes, and by what and how many, ways: Let such as have leisure and opportunity farther consider it.|$|E
60|$|Refrangibility of the Rays of Light, {{is their}} Disposition to be refracted or turned {{out of their}} Way in passing out of one <b>transparent</b> <b>Body</b> or Medium into another. And a greater or less Refrangibility of Rays, is their Disposition to be turned more or less out of their Way in like Incidences on the same Medium. Mathematicians usually {{consider}} the Rays of Light to be Lines reaching from the luminous Body to the Body illuminated, and the refraction of those Rays to be the bending or breaking of those lines in their passing out of one Medium into another. And thus may Rays and Refractions be considered, if Light be propagated in an instant. But by an Argument taken from the Æquations of the times of the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites, it seems that Light is propagated in time, spending in its passage from the Sun to us about seven Minutes of time: And therefore I have chosen to define Rays and Refractions in such general terms as may agree to Light in both cases.|$|E

50|$|A recent {{theory of}} DVM, termed the Transparency Regulator Hypothesis, argues that water {{transparency}} {{is the ultimate}} variable that determines the exogenous factor (or combination of factors) that causes DVM behavior in a given environment. In less transparent waters, where fish are present and more food is available, fish {{tend to be the}} main driver of DVM. In more <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies</b> of water, where fish are less numerous and food quality improves in deeper waters, UV light can travel farther, thus functioning as the main driver of DVM in such cases.|$|R
60|$|There {{are several}} Arguments that I could bring to evince {{that there are}} in all <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies</b> such atomical pores. And {{that there is such}} a fluid body as I am arguing for, which is the medium, or Instrument, by which the pulse of Light is convey'd from the lucid body to the enlightn'd. But that it being a {{digression}} from the Observations I was recording, about the Pores of Kettering Stone, it would be too much such, if I should protract it too long; and therefore I shall proceed to the next Observation.|$|R
60|$|At the 216th page we {{have another}} and a new case, in which clouds in perfect repose, {{unaffected}} by wind, or any influence but that of their own elastic force, boil, rise, and melt in the heaven with more approach to globular form than under any other circumstances is possible. I name this vignette, {{not only because it}} is most remarkable for the buoyancy and elasticity of inward energy, indicated through the most ponderous forms, and affords us a beautiful instance of the junction of the cirrostratus with the cumulus, of which we have just been speaking (§ 19,) but because it is a characteristic example of Turner's use of one of the facts of nature not hitherto noticed, that the edge of a partially <b>transparent</b> <b>body</b> is often darker than its central surface, because at the edge the light penetrates and passes through, which from the centre is reflected to the eye. The sharp, cutting edge of a wave, if not broken into foam, frequently appears for an instant almost black; and the outlines of these massy clouds, where their projecting forms rise in relief against the light of their bodies, are almost always marked clearly and firmly by very dark edges. Hence we have frequently, if not constantly, multitudinous forms indicated only by outline, giving character and solidity to the great masses of light, without taking away from their breadth. And Turner avails himself of these boldly and constantly,--outlining forms with the brush of which no other indication is given. All the grace and solidity of the white cloud on the right-hand side of the vignette before us, depends upon such outlines.|$|E
60|$|That {{the former}} {{of the two}} {{preceding}} Propositions is true, may be manifested by several Experiments; As first, if you take any two liquors differing from one another in density, but yet such as will readily mix: as Salt Water, or Brine, & Fresh; almost any kind of Salt dissolv'd in Water, and filtrated, so that it be cleer, spirit of Wine and Water; nay, spirit of Wine, and spirit of Wine, one more highly rectify'd then the other, and very many other liquors; if (I say) you take any two of these liquors, and mixing them in a Glass Viol, against one side of which you have fix'd or glued a small round piece of Paper, and shaking them well together (so that the parts of them may be somewhat disturb'd and move up and down) you endeavour to see that round piece of Paper through {{the body of the}} liquors, you shall plainly perceive the Figure to wave, and to be indented much after the same manner as the limb of the Sun through a Telescope seems to be, save onely that the mutations here, are much quicker. And if, in steed of this bigger Circle, you take a very small spot, and fasten and view it as the former, you will find it to appear much like the twinkling of the Starrs, though much quicker: which two Phænomena, (for I shall take notice of no more at present, though I could instance in multitudes of others) must necessarily be caus'd by an inflection of the Rays within the terminating superficies of the compounded medium, since the surfaces of the <b>transparent</b> <b>body</b> through which the Rays pass to the eye, are not at all altered or chang'd.|$|E
60|$|And fifthly, {{if these}} {{surfaces}} CD and FE are further remov'd asunder, the weaker pulse will yet lagg behind much further, and not onely be coincident with the second, cd, but lagg behind that also, and {{that so much}} the more, by how much the thicker the Plate be; so that by degrees it will be coincident with the third cd backward also, and by degrees, as the Plate grows thicker with a fourth, and so onward to a fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth; so that if there be a thin <b>transparent</b> <b>body,</b> that from the greatest thinness requisite to produce colours, does, {{in the manner of}} a Wedge, by degrees grow to the greatest thickness that a Plate can be of, to exhibit a colour by the reflection of Light from such a body, there shall be generated several consecutions of colours, whose order from the thin end towards the thick, shall be Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green; Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green; Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green; Yellow, &c. and these so often repeated, as the weaker pulse does lose paces with its Primary, or first pulse, and is coincident with a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, &c. pulse behind the first. And this, as it is coincident, or follows from the first Hypothesis I took of colours, so upon experiment have I found it in multitudes of instances that seem to prove it. One thing which seems of the greatest concern in this Hypothesis, is to determine the greatest or least thickness requisite for these effects, which, though I have not been wanting in attempting, yet so exceeding thin are these coloured Plates, and so imperfect our Microscope, that I have not been hitherto successfull, though if my endeavours shall answer my expectations, I shall hope to gratifie the curious Reader with some things more remov'd beyond our reach hitherto.|$|E
50|$|Now {{consider}} that, {{since there}} is no vacuum in Nature as almost all the Philosophers affirm, and since there are nevertheless many pores in all the bodies that we perceive around us, as experiment can show quite clearly, it is necessary that these pores be filled with some very subtle and very fluid material, extending without interruption from the stars and planets to us. Thus, this subtle material being compared with the wine in that vat, and the less fluid or heavier parts, of the air as well as of other <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies,</b> being compared with the bunches of grapes which are mixed in, you will easily understand the following: Just as the parts of this wine...tend to go down in a straight line through the hole other holes {{in the bottom of the}} vat...at the very instant that it is open...without any of those actions being impeded by the others, nor by the resistance of the bunches of grapes in this vat...in the same way, all of the parts of the subtle material, which are touched by the side of the sun that faces us, tend in a straight line towards our eyes at the very instant that we open them, without these parts impeding each other, and even without their being impeded by the heavier particles of <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies</b> which are between the two.|$|R
50|$|Some {{members of}} the genus Megalocranchia can reach large sizes, up to 1800mm {{in the case of}} M. fisheri. Young paralarvae often {{resemble}} other {{members of the}} Cranchiidae, having <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies</b> to aid in camouflage. Where the internal organs cannot be made transparent, for example in the digestive system, visceral photophores can be found. These visceral photophores are unique to this genus within the family. The paralarvae also have a thick gelatinous dermis covering the mantle, which again is unique to the Megalocranchia within the family. This dermis also features patches of orange chromatophores in juvenile individuals.|$|R
5000|$|Zooplankton {{have adapted}} by {{developing}} <b>transparent</b> <b>bodies,</b> bright colors, bad tastes and cyclomorphosis (seasonal changes in body shape). When predators release a chemical {{in the water}} to signal zooplankton; cyclomorphosis allows holoplankton to increase their spines and protective shields. Studies have shown that although small in size certain gelatinous zooplankton are rich in protein and lipid. [...] "Many holoplankton seem to have very little visible defense mechanisms; therefore, it is hypothesized that a chemical defense may be possible. Pelagic cnidarians have nematocysts that eject a tightly coiled venomous thread very rapidly. These threads penetrate the surface of their target and release a venom.|$|R
