5|$|Veronica meets Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo), who annoys both Veronica and Mac. Veronica, Parker, Mac, Wallace, and Piz go to a concert. Veronica {{talks about}} Piz’s {{problem at the}} concert, and three kids say that they saw a white girl who was faking being fat. Dick shows up at Mac’s door and tells her that Beaver never cared about her. Veronica finds Piz’s guitar, and they visit the seller. The seller’s {{description}} matches that of other people. Veronica talks to Piz about a suspect, {{but he says that}} it doesn’t match the woman he saw. Keith and the bail-jumper’s car gets stranded. Veronica signs up for the mentoring program in criminology class, and she notices that one of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> the concert has a criminal record. Dick gets beaten up when he talks to another man’s girlfriend, but Logan tases the man. Veronica finds the Welcome Wagon girl, the seller’s husband.|$|E
25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and the lights were {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E
500|$|On other occasions, though, Phineas's adventures have upset others, {{intentionally}} or otherwise. Most notably Candace {{is constantly}} frustrated in {{her efforts to}} [...] "bust" [...] her brothers throughout the series, and in rare cases Phineas has unwittingly caused misfortune to others. For example, in the episode [...] "Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face," [...] Phineas intentionally gives all <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> camp a fright when he tricks them into thinking Bigfoot is attacking, though this is mostly getting {{into the spirit of}} spooky story telling.|$|E

500|$|To {{keep the}} {{children}} complacent, Mr. Black informs the campers that Krusty has finally come, {{but it is}} actually Barney dressed as Krusty. Bart leads the campers in rebellion, driving out Mr. Black and the bullies, and changing the camp's name to Camp Bart. Kent Brockman reports on the revolt, where Bart explains the camp's deplorable conditions that caused him and the campers to rebel in the first place. The stress of seeing Bart {{as the leader of}} the rebellion during the report on TV causes Homer to immediately lose the hair he grew and regain the lost weight. Krusty is called away from his vacation, and arrives at the camp where <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> first don't believe its him, until a rough search reveals his iconic pacemaker scar. Krusty apologizes to the children for the poor conditions, saying that he was bribed to approve the camp. As compensation, Krusty takes them to [...] "the happiest place on Earth", Tijuana, Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Milhouse's father, Kirk, gives {{a speech}} to <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> Springfield Elementary about his {{occupation}} of assistant flyer distributor. Due to how boring the speech was, Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel take Lisa's advice and visit the Springfield Writer's Forum {{to find a better}} speaker. They find Jeff Jenkins, creator of a popular TV cartoon, Danger Dog. He comes to the school to give a presentation on Danger Dog, including showing them a sneak preview for the next Easter special, and fascinates the kids by telling them about the cartoon industry. Much to Skinner's horror, Jenkins tells the students how easy his job is and how he never needed to work hard to get his job. Later, every kid in school creates their own comic book, all of which are actually rip-off versions of Danger Dog. Bart also creates his own comic Danger Dude (which is actually a dog) and tries to sell it to Comic Book Guy, who criticizes his work. Stan Lee enters Comic Book Guy's store and tells Bart that his comic is bad, but that he should keep trying to [...] "find his own voice." ...|$|E
500|$|... "First Flight" [...] also {{provided}} {{the stage for}} an exchange with the United States Navy aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN-65). Three crew members of the real-life Enterprise had been voted as [...] "Sailors of the Year" [...] by the U.S. Navy, and so were given the roles of extras in this episode. This {{was not the first}} time such an exchange had occurred; previous winners had appeared as crew members on board the fictional Enterprise in the episode [...] "Desert Crossing". However, this time around they were given roles at the NX Command Center instead. Aviation Maintenance Administrationman 2nd Class James D. Frey portrayed a technician, Navy Counselor 1st Class Kathleen J. Grant played a Senator and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Thomas P. Hunt was the Senator's assistant. All three were pleased to be appearing on the show, with Grant saying that [...] "My nephew told all of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> his school his aunt was going to be on Star Trek. That makes the experience even more of a thrill for me", and Hunt saying [...] "This will be on reruns for years to come, when I'm 60, I'll be able to say, 'Hey, that's me on Enterprise.'". In return, the three sailors presented the cast and crew of Star Trek: Enterprise with a flag that had been flying on the aircraft carrier earlier in the month.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Some reviewers disliked Bond's clown costume, gorilla outfit and Tarzan yell during a jungle chase. James Berardinelli {{claimed that the}} movie was long and confusing, and strongly criticised Steven Berkoff's performance, describing it as [...] "offensively bad" [...] and the worst performance of any Bond villain. By contrast, the elegance of the film locations in India, and the stunts on aircraft and the train were appreciated. Jeffrey Westhoff at Rotten Tomatoes praised Roger Moore as being [...] "". Neal Gabler and Jeffrey Lyons at the TV-show Sneak Previews praised the film and said [...] "Octopussy delivers" [...] and [...] "The nice thing about Octopussy is that it's going back-to-basics, less gadgets, more hand-to-hand combat. It's more of an adventure movie in a more traditional sense and I like it for that". Danny Peary wrote that Octopussy [...] "has slow spots, little humour, and villains who aren’t nearly of the calibre of Dr. No, Goldfinger, or Blofeld. Also, the filmmakers {{make the mistake of}} demeaning Bond by having him swing through the trees and emitting a Tarzan cry and having him hide in a gorilla suit and later disguise himself as a clown (who all <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> the circus laugh at). It’s as if they’re trying to remind us that everything is tongue-in-cheek, but that makes little sense, for the film is much more serious than typical Bond outings – in fact, it recalls the tone of From Russia with Love." [...] Entertainment Weekly chose Octopussy as the third worst Bond film, while Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the eighth worst, and IGN chose it as the seventh worst. The review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 42% rating.|$|E
2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{was blamed}} {{by the media}} {{in the wake of}} the Columbine shooting, and responded to {{criticism}} in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, [...] "If you were to talk directly to <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?", to which he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them—I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "With such a silly concept, [...] probably should flop. However, it actually works pretty well. The best moments come {{from those that}} feature <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> the zoo, but a mix of other amusing scenes emerge. Though the show often threatens to falter, it usually succeeds." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode {{as one of the}} worst episodes of the season—the episodes that [...] "made me cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots".|$|E

2500|$|Miley {{has several}} reasons for {{creating}} Hannah. She is afraid that if <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> school discover she is famous they won't treat her the same. While she enjoys the attention of her fame as Hannah, she equally enjoys the option of [...] "stepping out" [...] of her role. Miley also values her privacy and doesn't want fans or paparazzi photographers mobbing her when she goes out in public. In this way, Hannah Montana presents a unique inversion of typical celebrity experiences. While most celebrities become famous as themselves and later need disguises to not be noticed in public, Hannah Montana became famous while in disguise, and now has the freedom to be in public as herself.|$|E
