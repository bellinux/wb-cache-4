5|$|In Bobby Petrino's {{first visit}} to Tuscaloosa as a head coach, Alabama opened conference play by {{defeating}} the Arkansas Razorbacks 35–7. After a scoreless first quarter, two big touchdown plays, a 52-yard run by Trent Richardson and a 50-yard pass from Greg McElroy to Julio Jones, had the Tide up 14–0 at the half. Arkansas responded early {{in the third quarter}} and cut the lead to 14–7 after Ryan Mallett hit Greg Childs for an 18-yard touchdown reception; <b>the</b> <b>Hogs</b> would not reach the end zone again as the Tide responded with three unanswered touchdowns. Bama scored first on an 80-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Marquis Maze followed with two touchdowns by Mark Ingram, one on a 14-yard pass from McElroy and one on a 2-yard run, bringing the final score to 35–7.|$|E
5|$|Sherwood {{lived in}} Pungo, Princess Anne County (today part of Virginia Beach), and married James Sherwood, a planter, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she {{was accused of}} casting a spell on a bull, {{resulting}} in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched <b>the</b> <b>hogs</b> and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful {{and her husband had}} to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>HOG</b> MAP kinase pathway in {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae senses and {{responds}} to high osmolarity. Here we demonstrated that HOG pathway mutants are hypersensitive to K 1 killer toxin, which implies certain defects in their cell wall. Overexpression of the PBS 2 gene leads to enhanced resistance to K 1 killer toxin. Treating yeast cells with a pore-forming antifungal agent, amphotericin B, lowers the cellular turgor pressure. More importantly, amphotericin B treatment leads to activation of <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway, supporting <b>the</b> hypothesis that loss of turgor pressure activates <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway. Deficiencies in <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway also cause hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide-generating drug plumbagin. Hydrogen peroxide, menadione and plumbagin all activate <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway. <b>The</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway acts parallel to Skn 7 p and Yap 1 p in oxidative stress response, {{evidenced by the}} additive effect of hog 1 Delta, skn 7 Delta and yap 1 Delta on hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. Both ssn 6 Delta and sko 1 Delta suppress hog 1 Delta mutant sensitivity to oxidants. Oxidative stress induces transcription of HSP 12 and HSP 26. <b>The</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway regulates HSP 12 transcription in this response. Msn 2 p and Msn 4 p are important for the oxidative stress-induced transcription of HSP 12 and HSP 26. <b>The</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway is also involved in heat shock response. Cells lacking <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> 1 gene are hypersensitive to heat stress. A temperature shift from 25 °C to 37 °C activates <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway. Such an increase in temperature also induces transcription of HSP 12 and HSP 26. <b>The</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway regulates HSP 12 transcription in the heat shock response.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>HOG</b> (High Osmolarity Glycerol response) pathway plays {{a central}} role in {{controlling}} stress response, ergosterol biosynthesis, virulence factor production, and differentiation of Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes fatal fungal meningoencephalitis. Recent transcriptome analysis of <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway discovered a Hog 1 -regulated gene (CNAG_ 00130. 2), encoding a putative protein kinase orthologous to Rck 1 / 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Srk 1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Its function is not known in C. neoformans. The present study functionally characterized the role of Hrk 1 in C. neoformans. Northern blot analysis confirmed that HRK 1 expression depends on <b>the</b> <b>Hog</b> 1 MAPK. Similar to <b>the</b> <b>hog</b> 1 D mutant, the hrk 1 D mutant exhibited almost complete resistance to fludioxonil, which triggers glycerol biosynthesis via <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway. Supporting this, the hrk 1 D mutant showed reduced intracellular glycerol accumulation and swollen cell morphology in response to fludioxonil, further suggesting that Hrk 1 works downstream of <b>the</b> <b>HOG</b> pathway. However, Hrk 1 also appeared to have Hog 1 -independent functions. Mutation of HRK 1 not only further increased osmosensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>hog</b> 1 D mutant, but also suppressed increased azole-resistance of <b>the</b> <b>hog</b> 1 D mutant in an Erg 11 independent manner. Furthermore, unlike <b>the</b> <b>hog</b> 1 D mutant, Hrk 1 was not involved in capsule biosynthesis. Hrk 1 was slightly involved in melanin production but dispensable for virulence of C. neoformans. These findings suggest that Hrk 1 plays both Hog 1 -dependent and –independent roles in stress and antifungal drug susceptibility and virulence facto...|$|R

25|$|The Razorbacks {{opened the}} College World Series in game 1 against #1 {{national}} seed Cal State Fullerton. Dallas Keuchel pitched well, with Zack Cox and Andy Wilkins both homering in a resounding 10-6 win.

LSU got a first-inning home run from pitcher Brett Eibner, and <b>the</b> <b>Hogs</b> bats fell silent in a 9-1 loss. Both fighting for their tournament lives, Arkansas met Virginia in an elimination game. The Razorbacks offense was again quiet, and <b>the</b> <b>Hogs</b> were down to their last strike when Brett Eibner homered to keep the Razorbacks in Omaha. <b>The</b> <b>Hogs</b> would prevail after another timely Andrew Darr double in the tenth inning. A rematch with LSU sat on the horizon, and the drained Arkansas pitching staff struggled. Closer Stephen Richards started the game for <b>the</b> <b>Hogs,</b> who were losing 4-0 by the third inning.
