5|$|After Parliament {{partially}} repealed the Townshend {{duties in}} 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended. Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained. Hancock tried {{to improve his}} relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence. In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the Boston Cadets, a militia unit whose primary function {{was to provide a}} ceremonial escort for the governor and <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court.</b> In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the Council, the upper chamber of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court,</b> whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> was {{the chief}} {{legislative}} and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by the freemen from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a grand jury of sorts elected from the freemen, who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for credible accusations. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court,</b> and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate decisions were made by a jury of freemen.|$|E
5|$|The colony's most {{powerful}} executive was its Governor, who was originally {{elected by the}} freemen but was later appointed by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> in an annual election. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> also elected seven Assistants to form a cabinet to assist the governor. The Governor and Assistants then appointed Constables {{who served as the}} chief administrators for the towns, and Messengers who were the main civil servants of the colony. They were responsible for publishing announcements, performing land surveys, carrying out executions, {{and a host of other}} duties.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{schools were}} rare in Plymouth colony. The first true school was not founded until 40 {{years after the}} {{foundation}} of the colony. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> first authorized colony-wide funding for formal public schooling in 1673, but only the town of Plymouth made use of these funds at that time. By 1683, though, five additional towns had received this funding.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>courts</b> {{deal with}} {{criminal}} cases, like an act {{defined in the}} Swedish Penal Code or in another law, for which a sanction is prescribed (e.g. theft or robbery). <b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>courts</b> also handle some civil law disputes, for example, disputes over {{the contents of a}} business agreement or cases relating to family law, {{and a number of other}} non-contentious matters; such as adoption and appointment of legal guardians.|$|R

However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached a unilateral declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> was not {{in session}} when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams {{therefore}} used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same. By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott. Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, a series of popular essays by John Dickinson which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such a wide audience.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court,</b> favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court,</b> as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E

5|$|In 1803, Harrison {{began to}} lobby Congress to repeal Article Six of the Northwest Ordinance, which {{prohibited}} {{slavery in the}} original Northwest Territory, in order permit slavery in the Indiana Territory. He claimed legalizing slavery was necessary to make the region more appealing to settlers and ultimately make the territory economically viable. That same year Harrison had indenturing legalized by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court.</b> The territory was granted representation in the United States Congress in 1805, and pro-slavery Benjamin Parke became the territory's first representative. Parke used his position to get Congress to support Harrison's appeal. He was able pass legislation to have Article Six suspended for ten years, and the territories covered by the ordinance were granted the ability to legalize slavery. By the same act, Congress removed the General Court's legislative power and created a legislative council to be elected by popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Learning that British {{troops were}} on the way, the Boston Town Meeting met on September 12, 1768 and {{requested}} that Governor Bernard convene <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court.</b> Bernard refused, so the town meeting called on the other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22. About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending military occupation violated Bostonians' natural, constitutional, and charter rights. By {{the time that the}} convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor. Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{later became}} a vestryman for Copole Parish and Justice of the Peace in Westmoreland County. In 1723, Lee {{became a member of}} the House of Burgesses. He held this office until he was {{appointed}} to the Governor's Council in the Virginia General Assembly in 1733. This position was a lifetime appointment. The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was the upper half of the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the House of Burgesses. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor. Members of the Council were advisers to the governor and judges in <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> of the colony. Their work led them to spend about a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.|$|E
