40|$|The {{light weight}} {{property}} {{as well as}} high corrosion resistance of aluminium alloy has increased their demand especially in automobile industries.

The results show that the tool which underwent polishing treatment reduces the cutting force as well as the aluminium adherence during the initial cutting process, and become worst as the process cutting continues. These results indicate that grinding mark texture improves the anti-adhesion by reducing the contact area during cutting and provide storage for the lubricant. In addition, too much polishing on the tool surface may remove these textures and resultantly worsen the tool performance...|$|R

50|$|An {{acoustic}} emission (AE) sensor {{works on}} principle of measuring the high-frequency energy signals produced during cutting process. It also measures the AE energy {{resulting from the}} fracture when a tool breaks. It is best suited to applications where the level of background AE signal is low compared {{to the sound of}} <b>tool</b> <b>breakage.</b> This makes the AE sensor ideal for breakage detection of small drills and taps. It is easy to install on both new and existing machines. AE sensor detects force proportional monitoring signals even in machining operations, which generate very small cutting forces. In combination with true power, it increases the reliability of breakage monitoring. It is used especially with solid carbide tools, or very small tools on large machines and multi spindles. Most of the sensors have to be attached to the machine tool surface. However, there are alternative methods of AE wave transmitting. A rotating, wireless AE sensor consists of a rotating sensor and a fixed receiver. An AE sensor can also receive the acoustic waves via a jet of cooling lubricant, which can be connected directly to the tool or workpiece.|$|E

40|$|In a {{flexible}} manufacturing system, cylinder blocks and heads are processed in batches by four machine in line. Each part is fully processed on one machine only. During batch production the tool magazines contain {{the same set}} of tools. This paper reports on a simulation study to investigate the possibility of reducing the investment in tools by sharing the tools among the machines by means of an automated tool transporting vehicle. The performance of the system is measured by the fraction of time that machines must wait for a tool required for the next imminent operation. These waiting (i. e. idle) times, which characterize the productivity loss, will depend on the selected tool mix, that is the number of tools (< 4) per tool type. The input to the simulation program consists of the process plan, tool lives, tool transport and handling times and the tool mix. Machines may break down due to <b>tool</b> <b>breakages.</b> The transport device carries one tool at a time. Special attention is given to the allocation policy of tools, which plays a central role during real-time operations. Since the process plans are fixed, the times when specific tools are required are known in advance. However, these “events” must be updated continually, due to waiting and breakdown periods. Since the lengths of these periods are not known in advance, updating takes place at the end of such periods. A “look- ahead” policy is defined based on the events. Results show that the system can be operated with considerable less investment in tools while maintaining a small fraction of machine idle times. The reduction in the tool investment out- weighs the extra investment in the tool transport device...|$|R

This paper discussed the quality issues of PCD tools produced by the two processes.

In this study, residual stress and graphitization were analyzed quantitatively with the Raman method. Maximum compression residual stress of 1. 4 GPa was recorded in the abrasively ground PCD of the smallest grade size while minimum compression residual stress of 0. 7 GPa was found in the PCD of the biggest grade. On the contrary, the dominant residual stress in the EDGeroded PCDs was tensile stress and its magnitude was in the range of 4. 7 to 0. 4 GPa. Through cutting tests, it was revealed that the residual stress and graphitization influenced the wear mechanism ofthe tool.

Meanwhile, the approach is applied to detect <b>tool</b> flute <b>breakage</b> during end milling by analyzing the feedmotor current signatures. RIPG_FMH can preserve the shape of signals and provide good noise attenuation in real time; here it will be applied to preprocess the signals of feed- motor current during end milling.

An advantage of the method is that can save the memory place of computer and reduce the computation time by comparison with a traditional wavelet transform. The determination of the suitable thresholds based on concurrent learning is another very important issue of the described method, which can effectively detect the abnormal state of a system.

40|$|Tool {{positioning}} and <b>tool</b> wear or <b>breakage</b> is {{an integral}} part of the development of a micromachining center. The nature of worn tools, producing deficiencies in good surface finish and dimension control, is a major concern in machining operations. Current techniques in place for tool location depend on the encoder feedback of the CNC system, with the assumption of accurate tool radius compensation. Additionally, in order to maintain machining quality and to prevent damage to the work-piece, accurate monitoring or early prediction of tool condition is important. These techniques however are insufficient for micro-machining where the tool itself is usually invisible to the human eye. Because the diameter is so small, accuracy is inherently compromised. Furthermore, due to the micron scales of micro-machining, detection as well as determination of <b>tool</b> wear or <b>breakage</b> is quite challenging. This paper reports on the results of an ongoing research project to investigate and develop machine vision applications for micro machining tool location and tool wear monitoring. The determination of an optimal optical setup is reported together with some algorithms for image processing and feature classification. The optical setup utilizes a 3 mega pixel CMOS capturing device mounted on 12 X ultra zoom lens. Lighting is achieved by direct, indirect and backlighting. Initial image analysis, utilizing basic Gaussian filters and histogram equalization indicates that lighting is a critical factor in this application. Wear determination is performed by a comparison of the image of an unused tool with that of a used tool using exclusive operators.

Experiments aimed at determining {{the effect of the}} grinding media diameter, drop height, bed height, input energy and specific energy on the resultant particle size distributions (PSDs) were performed using drop tests. The Attainable Region analysis tool was applied to determine the optimum production of an intermediate size class. In this context the AR is used more like a maximizing yield tool, as the goal is to determine the operating conditions that produce the most of an intermediate sized product, and mixing does not offer any advantage to milling alone. It was shown that different grinding media diameters produce different PSDs. The results show that there is a minimum amount of impact energy that needs to be reached in order for breakage to occur and an optimum impact energy in order to avoid overbreakage. It was proved that the specific energy is an extremely valuable parameter in analysing the breakage process and that for the same energy intensity, the resultant PSD is different.
