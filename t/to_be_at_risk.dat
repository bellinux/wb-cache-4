5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} he faced, Alderson transformed the ill-trained and poorly prepared Canadian recruits into tough, veteran soldiers {{and laid the}} foundations for later victories at Vimy Ridge and in other operations. An accomplished sportsman, Alderson wrote several books and was a keen proponent of hunting and yachting, pastimes he believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from developments in motor sports.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with either}} {{definite}} pulmonary AVMs or an abnormal contrast echocardiogram with no clearly visible lesions are deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from brain emboli. They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may {{form in the}} bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E

5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the breed to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the declining population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the breed. By the 1990s, population numbers were higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations still consider the breed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> due to low population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Major {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Port Arthur and Beaumont. Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes in Louisiana were also devastated with the towns of Cameron and Holly Beach completely wiped out. Offshore oil platforms throughout Rita's path also suffered significant damage, though the refineries of Houston, originally thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> escaped {{the brunt of the}} storm. Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm is estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 indirect deaths have also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city. Many of the indirect deaths were caused by a single bus fire in the mass exodus.|$|E
5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Australian {{government}} decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending {{the arrival of}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No.1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super Hornet. Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots experienced in the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model. No.1 Squadron re-equipped between 26March 2010 and 21October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It became operational with its new aircraft on 8December 2011. The multi-role Super Hornet allowed No.1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained full operational capability with the Super Hornet in December 2012.|$|E

One trial [40] did not describe the method of random sequence generation; no further clarification could be obtained. We judged all five studies <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> unclear <b>risk</b> for selection bias related to allocation since they did not adequately describe the method of allocation concealment [36 – 40].|$|R

25|$|Several {{species of}} {{sturgeon}} are harvested for their roe which is processed into caviar—a luxury {{food and the}} reason why caviar-producing sturgeons are among the most valuable of all wildlife resources. They are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and other threats, including pollution and habitat fragmentation. Most species of sturgeon are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of extinction, making them more critically endangered than any other group of species.|$|E
25|$|During the U.S. and Australian Armies' Lae campaign, the Fourth Air Army moved a {{large number}} of {{aircraft}} out of range of Allied fighters, to a cluster of airfields near Wewak, some 400miles (650km) west of the Huon Peninsula. Escort fighters did not have the range to reach Wewak from existing Allied air bases, and the Allies considered large-scale, long-range raids by unescorted heavy bombers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of heavy losses.|$|E

25|$|In a {{statement}} on 14 August 2014, The Pentagon said that the 20 US personnel who had visited the previous day had concluded that a rescue operation was probably unnecessary since there was less danger from exposure or dehydration and the Yazidis were no longer believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of attack from ISIL. Estimates also stated that 4,000 to 5,000 people remained on the mountain, with nearly half of which being Yazidi herders who lived there before the siege.|$|E
25|$|A 1984 {{study on}} the impact of peer support and support groups for victims of {{domestic}} violence showed that 146 battered women found women's peer support groups the most helpful source of a range of available treatments. The women in these groups appeared to give direct advice and to act as role models. A 1986 study on 70 adolescent mothers considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for domestic violence showed that peer support improved cognitive problem-solving skills, self-reinforcement, and parenting competence.|$|E
