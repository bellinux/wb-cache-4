5|$|Electoral {{legislation}} remained unchanged. Labor introduced {{bills for}} reform, {{but these were}} defeated {{in both houses of}} Parliament.

Even after the marginal and enhanced risk categories were added in October 2014, some television stations have continued to use the original three-category system to outline forecasted severe weather risks (though stations that do this may utilize in-house severe weather outlooks that vary to some degree from the SPC convective outlooks), while certain others that have switched to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> {{have chosen not to}} outline marginal risk areas.|$|E
5|$|Qadis {{generally}} have degrees in Sharia law from an Islamic university {{recognized by the}} Saudi government with, in many cases, a post-graduate qualification from the Institute of Higher Judiciary in Riyadh.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{scientific}} discipline concerned with magnetospheric currents has grown out from geomagnetism and, in particular, from geomagnetic storm studies.

5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of a covered platform with no station building, was created for the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's a Small World attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> of society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a means by which to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actors were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E
5|$|Public Act51 of 1951 amended and {{clarified}} <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> {{of jurisdiction}} over {{roads in the}} state. The existing tri-level system was maintained, splitting road jurisdiction between the state, counties and cities, as well as subdividing each level into several classifications. Further legislation redefined the exact distribution, but Act51 {{set up a system}} to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source, currently the Michigan Transportation Fund. Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased. Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition, they were increased during the following decade to deal with increasing traffic. The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements.|$|E
