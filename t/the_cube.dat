5|$|Chakotay pleads their case, but Janeway {{decides not to}} help them. As Chakotay {{returns to}} Voyager on board a shuttle, the Co-operative use their telepathic link {{to force him to}} travel to the Borg cube with Voyager in pursuit. Both Chakotay and an away team board <b>the</b> <b>cube,</b> and despite a firefight, he manages to reactivate the generator. This creates the new joint mind as expected, but also {{activates}} <b>the</b> <b>cube,</b> which begins powering up to attack Voyager. Chakotay and the away team are beamed back to Voyager as the Co-operative trigger the cube's self-destruct before it can endanger the Federation ship. The planet's inhabitants thank Voyager, but {{as a result of their}} actions, Chakotay later questions the morality of the Co-operative's motives with Janeway, as it connected many of the former Borg together in a new hive mind without consulting them.|$|E
5|$|Escher's {{later work}} Four Regular Solids (Stereometric Figure) {{returned}} {{to the theme of}} polyhedral compounds, depicting a more explicitly Keplerian form in which the compound of <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> and octahedron is nested within the compound of the dodecahedron and icosahedron.|$|E
50|$|Apart from renting <b>the</b> <b>cubes,</b> some {{store owners}} also collect {{commissions}} from <b>the</b> <b>cubes,</b> <b>the</b> commission ranges from 10-40% {{of the total}} income of <b>the</b> <b>cubes.</b> Since {{there are so many}} cubes and it is impossible for every tenant to look after <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> all <b>the</b> time, the storekeepers usually record down the products and transactions for both helping the tenants to manage their business and collecting commissions.|$|R
50|$|Every cube face is habitable, with gravity {{always being}} {{directed}} towards <b>the</b> <b>cube's</b> center; furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> {{are filled with}} caverns and tunnels.|$|R
50|$|The {{items in}} <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> are usually small items of cheap costs. Since <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> are not big, small items {{are good for}} {{accommodation}} and more styles of the products could be displayed. Some store owners would reserve some cubes for selling their own products, and renting most of <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> to tenants. It {{can be seen that}} renting <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> to tenants is more popular to the store owners as the income from renting is more steady and profitable.|$|R
5|$|The crystal {{structure}} of solid lead(II) nitrate {{has been determined}} by neutron diffraction. The compound crystallizes in the cubic system with the lead atoms in a face-centred cubic system. Its space group is Pa3Z=4 (Bravais lattice notation), with each side of <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> with length 784picometres.|$|E
5|$|The {{unit cell}} of silicon has a cubic packing {{arrangement}} of 8 atoms, and the unit cell volume may {{be measured by}} determining a single unit cell parameter, the length {{of one of the}} sides of <b>the</b> <b>cube,</b> a.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E

50|$|The {{second step}} is to {{determine}} the first digit of <b>the</b> two digit <b>cube</b> root by looking at the magnitude of <b>the</b> given <b>cube.</b> To do this, remove the last three digits of <b>the</b> given <b>cube</b> (29791 → 29) and find <b>the</b> greatest <b>cube</b> it is greater than (this is where knowing <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> of numbers 1-10 is needed). Here, 29 is greater than 1 cubed, greater than 2 cubed, greater than 3 cubed, but not greater than 4 <b>cubed.</b> <b>The</b> greatest <b>cube</b> it is greater than is 3, so the first digit of <b>the</b> two digit <b>cube</b> must be 3.|$|R
50|$|A polycube {{is a solid}} figure {{formed by}} joining one or more equal cubes face to face. Polycubes are the {{three-dimensional}} analogues of the planar polyominoes. <b>The</b> Soma <b>cube,</b> <b>the</b> Bedlam <b>cube,</b> <b>the</b> Diabolical <b>cube,</b> <b>the</b> Slothouber-Graatsma puzzle, and the Conway puzzle are examples of packing problems based on polycubes.|$|R
5|$|King {{was cast}} as Sarah Palmer in the horror remake of My Bloody Valentine 3D, {{which opened in}} January 2009. She {{appeared}} in the Star Wars-themed comedy Fanboys, which had a release date pushed first to January 2008 when director Kyle Newman received additional funding to shoot new scenes, but the busy schedule of the actors postponed filming. Still delayed, the filmmakers and its distributor, the Weinstein Company, {{are involved in a}} dispute over which version to release. In May 2008, King featured in another Newman-directed film, Act I of <b>The</b> <b>Cube,</b> the beginning of an online movie-making contest.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{base metal}} is iron, which {{is able to}} take on two {{crystalline}} forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one {{at the center of}} each of the six faces of <b>the</b> <b>cube.</b>|$|E
5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E

50|$|The {{first layer}} of Acheron, Avalas, is also called The Battlefield. It {{contains}} the highest density of metal cubes {{and is thus}} host to the most fighting on <b>the</b> plane. <b>The</b> <b>cubes</b> are dotted with fortresses and covered with battlefields. Collisions between <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> causes them to break apart in to smaller <b>cubes,</b> hence <b>the</b> smallest <b>cubes</b> are <b>the</b> oldest on the layer.|$|R
5|$|Tessellation can be {{extended}} to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence. The video opens within a black cube {{with an array of}} different colored lights with several people dancing. The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera panning around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> on his own, manipulating the motion of <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> with his hands, with his legs following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers. Following the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female (Staci Flood), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A break-down of the song, where Timberlake is beatboxing, shows him dancing by himself. The beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version, the album version cuts the beatboxing out. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera panning around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on <b>the</b> <b>cube,</b> Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by the Borg. Matters are complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E
5000|$|The {{perfection}} bonus {{takes into}} account how many cube rolls it took to clear all <b>the</b> <b>cubes.</b> From <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> first <b>cube</b> is cleared until the time <b>the</b> last <b>cube</b> is cleared, <b>the</b> counter increments. The immediate consequence {{of this is that}} one can mark a spot on the stage and wait to clear it until several rows of cubes roll over top of it. An initial number of rolls is set as being an ideal number to clear. If the player clears <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> in exactly this number of rolls (Perfect in Kurushi Final), they are given a [...] "Brilliant" [...] bonus of 5,000 points. If the player clears <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> in more than this number of rolls (Great in Kurushi Final), they are given a bonus of 1,000 points. If the player clears <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> in fewer number of rolls (Excellent in Kurushi Final), they are given a [...] "True Genius" [...] bonus of 10,000 points.|$|R
25|$|In {{multiple}} blindfolded, all of <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> are memorised, {{and then}} all of <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> are solved once blindfolded; thus, the main challenge is memorising many - often ten or more - separate <b>cubes.</b> <b>The</b> event is scored not by time but by the number of solved <b>cubes</b> minus <b>the</b> number of unsolved cubes after one hour has elapsed.|$|R
50|$|The {{chickens}} live peacefully {{in their}} own universe. In another universe, cubes are spying on the chickens. The leader of <b>the</b> <b>cubes,</b> general Cubicles, notices that the chickens have stacks of hay, and Cubicles mistakes them for kidnapped citizens of their universe. While Mort is filming his own TV show, <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> reach their universe via a well and kidnap all the baby chicks, scattering them across the chicken universe. Mort, being the only one brave enough to stop <b>the</b> <b>cubes,</b> jumps down <b>the</b> well and starts his adventure.|$|R
5|$|An away team boards <b>the</b> <b>cube,</b> {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|At that point, {{the party}} reunites with Zola, who {{supplies}} a Mechat {{for them to}} pursue Nene. As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat, Nene initiates an ancient machine that splits the world into two hemispheres, with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves. The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube {{at the core of}} the transformation. The party journeys through <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene. As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was the voice that told the others to swallow the spheres. When Zola was too weak to defend herself, Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>cubes</b> is also populated {{from the data}} warehouse.

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E
5|$|Henson's 1960s {{talk show}} {{appearances}} culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog. Rowlf {{became the first}} Muppet to make regular appearances on a network show, The Jimmy Dean Show. Henson was so grateful for this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966. The year 1969 saw the production of <b>The</b> <b>Cube,</b> another Henson-produced experimental movie.|$|E
5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as <b>the</b> <b>cube</b> of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} opacity. Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.|$|E
