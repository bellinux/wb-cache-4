40|$|Abstract <b>Trypanosoma</b> (Duttonella) <b>vivax</b> is an {{important}} cause of economic losses among feedlot cattle. These losses {{are related to the}} morbidity, mortality, reproductive issues and decreased production. It is known that the clinical signs observed in infections by this protozoon are similar to other hemoparasitosis, which difficult the diagnosis. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} detect and molecularly characterize an outbreak of trypanosomiasis caused by T. (D.) vivax in dairy cattle in the municipality of São Miguel Aleixo, state of Sergipe, Brazil. Blood samples from cattle (n = 15) presenting clinical signs compatible with trypanosomiasis were collected and parasitological and molecular evaluated. Among the samples analyzed, 34 % (5 / 15) were positive from blood smears, 60 % (9 / 15) from the buffy coat method and 80 % (12 / 15) from the molecular method. The DNA sequence obtained (659 bp) showed 99 % similarity to T. (D.) vivax sequences that are available in the GenBank database. The presence of this protozoon in cattle herds is a problem for producers. Diagnosing trypanosomiasis is problematic because its evolution is similar to that of other parasitic blood diseases.

Soluble forms of predominant VSGs expressed during the early infection stages were purified and corresponded to concanavalin A-binding proteins with molecular masses of 48 – 67 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electropohoresis, and pI values between 6. 1 and 7. 5. The biochemical characterization of all purified soluble VSGs revealed that they were dimers in their native form and represented different gene products. Sequencing {{of some of these}} proteins yielded peptides homologous to VSGs from Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei and Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) evansi and established that they most likely are mosaics generated by homologous recombination.

Methods Multidimensional scaling and phylogenetic analyses of 112 sequences of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) gene and 263 sequences of the internal transcribed spacer of rDNA (ITS rDNA) were performed to compare trypanosomes from tsetse flies from Gorongosa National Park and Niassa National Reserve of Mozambique (MZ), wild ungulates and livestock from EA, and livestock isolates from WA and SA. Results Multidimensional scaling (MDS) supported Tvv (T. vivax) and TvL (T. vivax-like) evolutionary lineages: 1) Tvv comprises two main groups, TvvA/B (all SA and WA isolates plus some isolates from EA) and TvvC/D (exclusively from EA). The network revealed five ITS-genotypes within Tvv: Tvv 1 (WA/EA isolates), Tvv 2 (SA) and Tvv 3 – 5 (EA). EA genotypes of Tvv ranged from highly related to largely different from WA/SA genotypes. 2) TvL comprises two gGAPDH-groups formed exclusively by EA sequences, TvLA (Tanzania/Kenya) and TvLB-D (MZ). This lineage contains more than 11 ITS-genotypes, seven forming the lineage TvL-Gorongosa that diverged from T. vivax Y 486 enough {{to be identified as}} another species of the subgenus Duttonella. While gGAPDH sequences were fundamental for classification at the subgenus, major evolutionary lineages and species levels, ITS rDNA sequences permitted identification of known and novel genotypes. Conclusions Our results corroborate a remarkable diversity of Duttonella trypanosomes in EA, especially in wildlife conservation areas, compared to the moderate diversity in WA. Surveys in wilderness areas in WA may reveal greater diversity. Biogeographical and phylogenetic data point to EA as the place of origin, diversification and spread of Duttonella trypanosomes across Africa, providing relevant insights towards the understanding of T. vivax evolutionary history.

40|$|Animal {{trypanosomosis}} is {{a serious}} constraint to livestock productivity in tropical and subtropical countries. The pathogenic trypanosomes in bovidae are <b>Trypanosoma</b> congolense, T. <b>vivax,</b> T. brucei and T. evansi. Current serological tests to detect trypanosome infections {{are based on the}} use of whole trypanosome lysates; their potential is limited by antigen instability, lack of reproducibility and lack of test specificity due to the antibody's long persistence after treatment. The development of new tests based on recombinant technology that could be standardized and applied on a large scale at low cost would be very helpful. The major invariant antigen recognized by T. congolense infected cattle belongs to the heat shock protein (HSP) 70 family and is closely related to mammalian Immunoglobulin Binding Protein (BiP). To improve the initial ELISA based on a recombinant fragment of HSP 70 /BiP, we developed an inhibition ELISA using an anti-BiP monoclonal antibody and a full-length fusion protein expressed in E. coli. Here we report {{on the development of the}} test and provide an initial assessment of its performance using sets of sera from experimental infections and from naturally infected cattle maintained in tsetse infested areas of Africa. The HSP 70 /BIP-based inhibition ELISA shows a good sensitivity in cattle experimentally infected with T. congolense, with an improved sensitivity in secondary infections. One major advantage, particularly for its further application in national laboratories, is that one single set of reagents and one single procedure are sufficient to apply on different mammalian host species infected with different trypanosome species.

40|$|Flagellated {{protozoan}} parasites {{that live}} in the blood, lymph and various tissues of their vertebrate hosts: <b>Trypanosoma</b> congolense, T. <b>vivax,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} T. brucei brucei. T. uniforme and T. simiae are other, less common tsetse-transmitted species. T. congolense and T. vivax are mainly intravascular parasites while T. brucei has an affinity for tissues. Several types of T. congolense can be distinguished by molecular biology; the most common and pathogenic one in cattle is the type “savannah ” (large variation in pathogenicity within the savannah subgroup), the other ones (type „forest ‟ and „Kilifi ‟ or Kenya coast) are less pathogenic and have different host affinity. Mixed trypanosome infections with two or three species are common. Resistance to physical and chemical action Disinfectants/chemicals: Controlling arthropod vectors and preventing access to host species is important in preventing new infections. Disinfection does not prevent spread of disease (blood-borne parasite). Survival: These agents can only survive in blood, body fluids and tissues of animal hosts and within tsetse flies. Mechanically transmitted T. vivax cannot survive long outside the host. Agents disappear within a few hours after death of the vertebrate host. EPIDEMIOLOGY Tsetse flies infest 10 million square kilometres and affect 37 countries, mostly in Africa, where it is known as „Nagana‟. It is the most economically important livestock disease of Africa, especially of cattle. Hosts Wild animals: natural hosts o At least 30 species, including greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), warthog (Phacohoerus aethiopicus), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), bush pig (Potamochoerus porcus), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), African elephant (Loxodonta africana), white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), black rhinocero...|$|R
40|$|DNA reads {{generated}} by large-scale sequencing projects {{have to be}} processed before further analyses in order to perform vector/primer masking, low-quality trimming and contaminant removal. This sequential processing involves several steps {{and the use of}} different computer programs, each one following its own calling convention and input/output formats. As a consequence, building a sequence processing pipeline is generally a tedious and exhaustive task. In addition, the currently available pipelines are often poorly documented, requiring careful examination of Perl, Python or shellscript codes before they can be properly configured. Some others are more specialized to perform determined functions [1, 2], not allowing the incorporation of new modules in an integrated way. This paper reports the development of E-Gene, an integrated system that makes pipeline construction a modular job. We have created a unified view of the building blocks of the pipeline and of the integration pattern of the various processing steps. A set of Perl "capsules" for different programs like Blast [3], Phred [4, 5], Cap 3 [6], Cross_Match [7], etc., as well as new and specific programs for overall read quality evaluation and filtering, end trimming and chimera finding were developed, in addition to diferent report generators. The pipelines created by E-Gene are described in a single configuration file, that also serves as an easy-to-read documentation. Finally, a Java-based visual tool was conceived to facilitate the process of pipeline construction. E-Gene was successfully used to build and configure pipelines for three distinct EST projects: <b>Trypanosoma</b> cruzi, Plasmodium <b>vivax</b> and Eimeria tenella. The whole system is highly portable, as is totally written in Perl, and only needs the original set [...] ...|$|R
