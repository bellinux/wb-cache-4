50|$|A cable color scheme, {{known as}} even-count color code, is {{determined}} for 25 pairs of conductors as follows: For each ring, the primary, more prominent color is chosen {{from the set}} blue, orange, green, brown, and slate, in that order, and the secondary, thinner stripe color from the set of white, red, black, yellow, and violet colors, in that order. The <b>tip</b> <b>conductor</b> color scheme uses the same colors as the matching ring but switches {{the thickness of the}} primary and secondary colored stripes. Since the sets are ordered, an orange (color 2 in its set) with a yellow (color 4) is the color scheme for the 4·5 + 2 − 5 = 17th pair of wires. If the yellow is the more prominent, thicker stripe, then the wire is a <b>tip</b> <b>conductor</b> connecting to the pin numbered 25 + the pair #, which is pin 42 in this case. Ring conductors connect to the same pin number as the pair number.|$|E

50|$|Tip {{and ring}} are {{the names of}} the two {{conductors}} or sides of a telephone line. The terms originate in reference to the telephone plugs used for connecting telephone calls in manual switchboards. One side of the line is connected to the metal tip of the plug, and the second is connected to a metal ring behind the tip, separated and insulated from the tip by a non-conducting material. When inserted into a jack, the plug's <b>tip</b> <b>conductor</b> connects first, followed by the ring conductor. In many European countries tip and ring are referred to as the A and B wires.|$|E
50|$|When the {{telephone}} is on-hook, {{the potential of}} the ring conductor of the local loop is held at a nominal level of -48V DC with respect to the <b>tip</b> <b>conductor,</b> provided by {{the telephone}} exchange or a foreign exchange station (FXS) interface. When the terminal initiates use of the line, it causes current to flow by closing the loop, and this signals the exchange to provide dial tone on the line and to expect dial signals, in form of DTMF digits or dial pulses, or a hook flash. When the loop is opened and current stops flowing for a certain period of time, the subscriber equipment signals that it has finished using the line; the telephone exchange resets the line to an idle state. For alerting an incoming call, the exchange rings the telephone by superimposing an alternating current (AC) signal onto the line of between 40 V and 90 V. The frequency of the signal is 20 Hz. In early exchanges, the ringing power was produced by a hand-cranked generator in the operator console of the exchange.|$|E

40|$|Both {{males and}} females of the spider Leucauge mariana (Taczanowski 1881) {{contribute}} material to the plugs that often occlude the genital openings of females in the field. Males were sometimes unable to remove or penetrate these plugs, but overcame others using three different mechanical mechanisms: snag the plug and pull it off; break and penetrate through it; and break its adhesion to the epigynum by injecting material under it. They used their genitalia to accomplish these tasks, {{despite the fact that}} the genital bulb lacks muscles and innervation, thus limiting the male's ability to guide genital movements precisely. The effects of two male genital structures, the <b>conductor</b> <b>tip</b> and the <b>conductor</b> hook on sperm transfer and genital plug removal were tested by direct observations of their morphology and behavior, and by experimental removal of structures from one but not the other palp of the same male. Removal of the <b>conductor</b> <b>tip</b> reduced sperm transfer, while removal of both the hook and the conductor reduced plug removal. A preliminary characterization of palp movements and their sequences did not reveal any behavior that seemed especially designed for removing plugs, as opposed to inseminating the female. 9 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|Carathea is a genus of Tasmanian spiders {{within the}} Malkaridae family that was named and first {{described}} by R. J. Moran in 1986.

The features unique to spiders of this genus include a thin <b>tip</b> to the <b>conductor</b> (a sclerite in the male palpal bulb), the absence of [...] "horns" [...] on the carapace, and, in females, the internal genitalia are large and less compact, usually only containing three or four coils.|$|R

[...] Anecdotes abound as to Bruckner's dogged pursuit of his chosen craft and his humble acceptance of the fame that eventually came his way. Once, after a rehearsal of his Fourth Symphony in 1881, the well-meaning Bruckner <b>tipped</b> the <b>conductor</b> Hans Richter: [...] "When the symphony was over," [...] Richter related, [...] "Bruckner came to me, his face beaming with enthusiasm and joy. I felt him press a coin into my hand. 'Take this' he said, 'and drink a glass of beer to my health.'" [...] Richter, of course, accepted the coin, a Maria Theresa thaler, and wore it on his watch-chain ever after.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine subject response to music conducting motions simulated on a computer screen. Forty musicians and forty non-musicians responded to a point of light moving around a computer screen simulating the <b>tip</b> of a <b>conductor's</b> baton. Subjects were asked to press a button every time they perceived a beat portrayed in the motions. The timing of subject responses to four modes of motion was recorded and analyzed. In order to produce sound from their musical instruments, musicians must undergo a process that involves developing a mental image of the upcoming sound, creating an action program, and performing the chain of physical events that will culminate in the production of the desired sound. Even though it may last a mere fraction of a second, this process of anticipation is an essential component of music making. Whereas solo musicians anticipate the music rather freely, ensemble musicians must meet an essential requirement for obtaining satisfying musical results: they must play together. Since they also need to anticipate the music, then they must anticipate together in order to play together. This coordination is accomplished by way of visual information provided by the conductor. In the present study it was hypothesized that speed and direction of conducting motions from any given beat to the next {{play an important role in}} the observers' ability to anticipate and synchronize their motor activity. The experimental design allowed the author to examine visual perception of simulated conducting motions showing distinct motion behaviors, in isolation from actual sound and other sensory cues. Results of this investigation indicate that both musicians and non-musicians respond with a high degree of uniformity to a type of conducting motion which resembles the motion produced by gravitational forces [...] accelerating going down, decelerating going up, following a parabolic trajectory when moving to either side. On the other hand, a motion which is inversely proportional to the motion produced by gravity yielded mixed results: non-musicians responded more uniformly than did musicians, as the latter were divided according to two distinct interpretations of where the beats occurred within the simulated conducting patterns...|$|R
