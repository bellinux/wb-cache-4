5|$|The {{process was}} {{abruptly}} halted by <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> control rod reinserting itself, {{due to its}} trip level being set too low. At 11:25, Fermi ordered the control rods reinserted. He then {{announced that it was}} lunch time.|$|E
50|$|Goudreau {{occasionally}} sits in with James Montgomery and was {{a member}} of Ernie and <b>the</b> <b>Automatics</b> with Sib Hashian, Tim Archibald, Brian Maes, Michael Antunes and “car guy” Ernie Boch, Jr. Ernie and <b>the</b> <b>Automatics</b> has disbanded.|$|R
50|$|Boch {{has formed}} a band, Ernie and <b>the</b> <b>Automatics.</b> Ernie and <b>the</b> <b>Automatics</b> album Low Expectations was on Billboards Top Blues Album chart for six weeks, debuting at #7. He {{graduated}} from Berklee College of Music in Boston, and formerly sat on the colleges Board of Trustees.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} Sex Pistols and <b>The</b> Damned, <b>the</b> <b>Automatics</b> {{regularly}} played <b>the</b> Marquee Club in London and toured clubs around the U.K. and Europe. Their hit song [...] "When the Tanks Roll Over Poland Again", (released on Island Records in 1978) was {{number one on}} the punk/new wave charts. It {{was one of the first}} records to be produced by Steve Lillywhite, who was Philp's flatmate at the time, and who went on to produce U2. It is listed at 22 of the top 50 punk songs from that era by Punks Reunited. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Automatics</b> also played gigs with Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers and Thunders himself played on <b>the</b> <b>Automatics</b> first album, Walking with the Radio (available through Angel Air, UK). <b>The</b> <b>Automatics</b> toured England with the Vibrators and played the Reading Festival in 1979. In 1980, Dave Philp moved to California, where he remained lead singer and songwriter for <b>the</b> <b>Automatics</b> but with different players in the band. This early history is recounted in No More Heroes: A Complete History of UK Punk from 1976 to 1980 by the English critic Alex Ogg.|$|R

5|$|A {{variant of}} <b>the</b> <b>Automatic</b> Block System, Automatic and Track Control (ATC) {{has since been}} introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury, {{and then on the}} main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.|$|E

5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded an {{automatic}} bid to the Orange Bowl game. <b>The</b> <b>automatic</b> ACC bid {{was the result of}} an off-season deal following the inaugural ACC Championship Game which granted the winner of the ACC Championship Game an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl unless it was ranked high enough in the Bowl Championship Series standings to play in the National Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. <b>The</b> <b>automatic</b> and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
5|$|In the {{qualification}} {{round at}} the World Championships, held in windy {{conditions on the}} Helsinki Olympic Stadium, only Pitkämäki, Makarov and Thorkildsen managed to beat <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> qualification mark of 81metres. Rain supplemented the wind the following day, constituting difficult weather conditions for the javelin final. Thorkildsen, in the lead after three rounds with 86.18metres, eventually finished in silver medal position behind Andrus Värnik of Estonia as the latter threw 87.17metres in the fourth round.|$|E

5|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1942 the TRE {{development}} team began experimenting with systems to project the display onto the windscreen, and by October had combined this with an image of the existing GGS Mk. II gyro gunsight to produce a true head-up display known as <b>the</b> <b>Automatic</b> Pilot's Indicator, or API. A single example was fitted to a Beaufighter and tested through October, and numerous modifications and follow-on examples were trialled over the next year.|$|E
5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were {{too large to}} easily stabilize. Because {{of the way it}} was built, <b>the</b> <b>Automatic</b> Bomb Sight could be equipped with a stabilizer but it was estimated that it would be some time before it could be modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times and was still not available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|The Privileges Committee {{unanimously}} {{found that}} the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive Royal Assent, and from 1999, hereditary peers have not had <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> right to sit in Parliament.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>automatics</b> are {{available}} in two models as 6-speed top two overdrive electronically controlled Allison MD3060 and AL306 and both have a hydraulic retarder as an option with maximum brake torque of 1700 Nm.|$|R
5|$|The {{draw that}} {{determined}} the semi-final running order {{was held on}} 25 January 2012 at the Buta Palace. The participating countries, excluding <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> finalists (Azerbaijan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), were split into six pots, based upon how those countries voted in past contests. From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012. This draw also acted as an approximate running order, {{in order for the}} delegations from the countries to know when their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> finalists would be allowed to vote in.|$|E
5|$|The first notable {{musician}} {{to use the}} Mellotron was variety pianist Geoff Unwin, who {{was specifically}} hired by Robinson in 1962 to promote {{the use of the}} instrument. He toured with a Mk II Mellotron and made numerous appearances on television and radio. Unwin claimed that <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> backing tracks on the Mk II's left hand keyboard allowed him to provide more accomplished performances than his own basic skills on the piano could provide.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} underpinnings {{are based}} on the mainstream VE Commodore models of the same years. The car is powered by GM's 6.2-litre LS3 V8 engine, with a maximum power output of 442 PS (325kW). Buyers have the option of a six-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic transmission; the manual is capable of reaching 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.5 seconds and <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> is capable of 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.6 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for {{vehicles}} equipped with <b>the</b> 7-speed <b>automatic</b> has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, <b>the</b> new 7-speed <b>automatic</b> has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than <b>the</b> old 5-speed <b>automatic</b> and <b>the</b> 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. <b>The</b> new 7-speed <b>automatic</b> retains <b>the</b> Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of <b>the</b> previous 5-speed <b>automatic.</b> Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with <b>the</b> 7-speed <b>automatic.</b> <b>The</b> new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|R
5000|$|From 1930 {{through the}} late 1940s, the U.S. Army awarded <b>the</b> Distinguished <b>Automatic</b> Rifleman Badge {{to those who had}} earned the Army's Team Marksmanship Badge for BAR with {{sufficient}} points to qualify for [...] "distinguished status." [...] When marksmanship competitions resumed after World War II, the Army limited competitions to the rifle and pistol. Thus, <b>the</b> Distinguished <b>Automatic</b> Rifleman Badge was retired, along with <b>the</b> Army's <b>Automatic</b> Rifle Team Marksmanship Badge.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> modern <b>automatic</b> transmission and <b>the</b> integration of electronic controls have allowed great progress in recent years. <b>The</b> modern <b>automatic</b> transmission is {{now able to}} achieve better fuel economy, reduced engine emissions, greater shift system reliability, improved shift feel, improved shift speed and improved vehicle handling. The immense range of programmability offered by a TCU allows <b>the</b> modern <b>automatic</b> transmission {{to be used with}} appropriate transmission characteristics for each application.|$|R
5|$|A {{prototype}} of <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> strobe unit {{was produced in}} October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Captain Renaudin, of Généreux, and Joseph Allemand, of Ville de Marseille, {{were both}} honourably acquitted during <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> court-martial {{for the loss}} of their ships. The French Navy made no further efforts to reach Malta, and all {{subsequent}} efforts by French warships to break out the port were met by the blockade, only one frigate breaking through and reaching France. Without the supplies carried on Perrée's convoy, starvation and disease spread throughout the garrison {{and by the end of}} August 1800, French soldiers were dying at a rate of 100 a day. On 4 September, Vaubois finally capitulated, turning the island over to the British, who retained it for the next 164 years.|$|E
5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> {{processing of information}} (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
50|$|Shaanxi Fast Auto Drive Group {{is one of}} <b>the</b> major <b>automatic</b> {{transmission}} {{manufacturers in}} China. It was founded in 1968, and formed {{a joint venture with}} Eaton Corporation. It is now <b>the</b> largest <b>automatic</b> transmission manufacturer in China.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Rieder <b>Automatic</b> Rifle was a fully {{automatic}} Lee-Enfield SMLE rifle conversion of South African origin.
