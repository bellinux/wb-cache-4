Children were unpaid and bound apprentice until they were 21. They boarded on an upper floor of the building, and were locked in. Shifts were typically 10-10.5 hours in length (i.e. 12 hours after allowing for meal breaks), and the apprentices 'hot bunked' : a child who had just finished his shift would sleep in a bed only just vacated by a child now just starting his shift. Peel himself admitted that conditions at the mill were [...] "very bad".|$|E
40|$|The chip shape – {{besides the}} cutting forces, tool wear and surface {{roughness}} – {{is one of}} the most commonly used criteria for the evaluation of the machinability. The importance of the chip shape can be explained by its strong influence on process reliability. In consequence an automation of cutting operations is only possible for fa-vourable chip shapes. For longitudinal turning as well as for other processes with con-tinuous cutting edge contact, periodic chip breakage is necessary to avoid unfavourable ribbon or <b>thread</b> chips. Chip <b>breakage</b> is caused by a variety of mutually dependant in-fluencing factors related to workpiece, tool or process parameters. A possibility to predict chip breakage is to model these influences. The three-dimensional Finite Element Method (3 D-FEM) offers the possibility to take the complex chip breaker geometries of the cutting tool into account. For FE-modelling of chip breakage, a criterion is needed, capable of calculating material failure at the position of chip breakage. However, the definition of such a criterion requires research into the thermo-mechanical loads that cause chip breakage. Accordingly, this thesis aims to predict chip breakage using a damage model, which is based on the mechanical and thermal loads in the chip. It contributes to a more funda-mental understanding of cutting processes with geometrically defined cutting edges in general and contributes the prediction of chip breakage in longitudinal turning of AISI 1045. A model-based approach was chosen in order to calculate thermo-mechanical loads. Based on these loads, an adequate damage model could be defined. The localisation of chip breakage and the dominant failure mechanisms in the chip breakage zone were determined in empirical investigations of the cutting process. By applying a sensitivity analysis, the strongest tool- and process-related influences that cause chip breakage were identified and different process conditions for finishing and roughing tool geome-tries were determined. The process conditions included parameter sets with controlled chip breakage as well as sets with unfavourable chip shapes. For the parameter sets with controlled chip breakage, the time and position of material failure were identified using a high speed filming device. The analysis of the chip fracture faces revealed duc-tile material failure as the dominant failure mechanism. Different damage models for this type of material failure were presented and discussed regarding their potential and ap-plicability to predict chip breakage. The decision between the use of existing damage models and the definition of a new damage model was made on the basis of the thermo-mechanical loads in the chip breakage position. An analytic model was then de-veloped to transform the distribution of stress in a blocked chip to a status of plane stress. The maximum tensile stresses depending on the cutting conditions and tool ge-ometry were calculated based on this model. The model correlated with the real borders of controlled chip breakage in a wide range of cuttings depths and feed rates. Only for small cutting depths and large feed rates a significant difference compared to real chip breakage was identified. This deviation is caused by the complex three-dimensional chip flow under these process conditions. It is assumed that these cutting conditions require three-dimensional modelling of the chip flow. Consequently the chip formation, chip flow and expansion of the chip were modelled three-dimensionally using the Finite Element Method (FEM). In this model the current loads as well as their time-dependent developments could be determined. The evalua-tion of the existing damage criteria showed that none of the presented criteria offer suf-ficient reliability for the prediction of chip breakage. Therefore an independent damage criterion for chip breakage prediction was developed based on a damage model of Johnson and Cook. This criterion calculated the residual deformability of the material depending on the tolerated temperatures, strain rates and stress conditions. The calcu-lated damage value lead to a reduction of the material strength and to a local softening in the chip. The implementation of this damage criterion in the FEM-model enabled three-dimensional simulation of chip breakage. The model correlated well with the chip flow and breakage as well as with the empirically determined cutting forces and tem-peratures on the lower surface of the chip. The FEM-model developed enables system-atic investigation of the influence of tool geometries and cutting conditions on chip breakage for turning operations of AISI 1045...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for high {{industrial}} productivity, thread tension is of vital significance in embroidery machine systems. By appropriately adjusting the thread tension during the embroidering process, a lower thread-breakage rate can be achieved, and as a result, the embroidering speed and productivity will be greatly improved. In this research, we shall address the thread tension problem. First, we analyze the critical part of the thread, where breakage {{is most likely to}} occur during the embroidering process, using an image capturing and processing technique; then, a particular dynamics model of the thread motion in the critical part will be derived. From the model attained, mechanisms to reduce the peak tension and the <b>thread</b> <b>breakage</b> rate for embroidery machines will be developed. The <b>thread</b> <b>breakage</b> rate can be reduced from the improvement of the tension system. However, a reliable and economical breakage detection system is also indispensable for an embroidery machine system. But current design of the breakage detection system cannot meet the requirements of the embroidering process at higher and higher speeds. A new detection system is constructed in this research. Based on the detector mechanism of current design, an advanced breakage judgment rule is proposed. And, new designs in the detection logic unit and the communication network provide the high-performance detection function, which is desired in embroidery machine systems...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} flap tension on the tearing characteristics of mucosal tissue samples in relation to various suture and needle characteristics. Material and methods: Lining and masticatory mucosal tissue samples obtained from pig jaws were prepared for in vitro testing. Tension tearing diagrams of 60 experiments were traced for 3 - 0, 5 - 0 and 7 - 0 sutures with applied forces up to 20 N. In the second part, the same experiments were repeated with 100 diagrams to test the influence of needle characteristics with 5 - 0 and 6 - 0 sutures using only gingival tissue samples. Results: 3 - 0 sutures mainly lead to tissue breakage {{at an average of}} 13. 4 N. In contrast, 7 - 0 sutures only resulted in breakage of the thread at a mean applied force of 3. 7 N. With 5 - 0 sutures, both events occurred at random at a mean force of 14. 6 N. Irrespective of the needle characteristics, the mean breaking force for gingival samples with 5 - 0 and 6 - 0 sutures was approximately 10 N. Conclusions: Tissue trauma may be reduced by choosing finer suture diameters, because thinner (6 - 0, 7 - 0) sutures lead to <b>thread</b> <b>breakage</b> rather than tissue breakage. © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Wyróżniając charakterystyczne fazy działania podciągacza, tj. zasilanie nicią oraz wybieranie nici kończące się tzw. zaciąganiem ściegu, zwrócono uwagę na warunki lokowania przeplotu w materiale i możliwość ich poprawiania poprzez budowę podciągacza. Temu celowi służyło modelowanie procesu zaciągania ściegu. Zaprojektowany i zbudowany podciągacz nici pozwolił ponad dwukrotnie obniżyć szczytowe wartości siły zaciągania ściegu, co jest znaczącym osiągnięciem techniczno-technologicznym. Ponadto spowodował spadek strat wytrzymałości nici na zrywanie. Analysis of {{literature}} {{described in the}} dissertation showed the complexity of phenomena of machine stitch creation processes. The reference to the lockstitch proves particularly difficult working conditions of needle thread. Tools forming the stitch (needle, bobbin, needle thread take-up, thread tensioner, transporter of the textile package) cause the weakening of thread inserted into the seam structure, what can lead to <b>thread</b> <b>breakage.</b> Hence, a great {{attention is paid to}} the action on thread of stitch forming mechanisms in the sewing machines. A particular role of thread take-up mechanism was stressed during discussing the process of thread control conditions by the take-up in the lockstitch machines. Characteristic working phases of the take-up were distinguished i. e., supplying by the thread and drawing of thread end during the stitch tightening. One has paid the attention to the conditions of interlacement location in the material and the possibility of correcting them by the improving the structure of the thread take-up mechanism. Changing the stitch tightening modelling process was to achieve this aim. So, a physical model, and next a mathematical model of the zone of stitch creation were elaborated. Due to the possibility of configuration of multibarrier take-ups creation a model of the stitch tightening considering the take-up disc was built. The presented results of model research required the experimental verification. The dynamic tensions in threads and the thread strength decrease after the sewing through process as well as a reaction of the take-up to changes thread length in the link of the stitch were studied. Carrying out the experimental analysis required the building the take-up disc installed on the chosen machine. Thus, {{there is a need for}} elaboration of the methodology of the take-ups disc designing using genetic algorithms as well as a classical programming in Fortan and C++ languages. The determination of requirement take-up disc configuration was preceded by a definition of the curve of the thread controlled by the take-up disc. Next, one made an estimation of defined curve of the thread controlled by take-up disc with a software called "Take-up disc 2. 0 " elaborated on the basis of genetic algorithm. The designed and built thread take-up disc allow decreasing peaks of strength of the stitch tightening over twice of the basic value, which is the significant achievement from a technical-technological point of view. Moreover, it causes the decrease of thread breaking strength losses. In the case of the take-up disc, holding the position of the interlacement in the stitch link on the set level requires the extending the part of machine working cycle corresponding to the stitch tightening in comparison to the generally used take-ups...|$|E
