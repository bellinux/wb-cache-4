5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri.

After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, LaBeouf {{spoke about}} the {{plagiarism}} accusations with Bleeding Cool writer Rich Johnston, where he stated that he saw copyright laws as too restrictive and {{that it did not}} allow for ideas to flow freely. LaBeouf later tweeted a description of his next project, Daniel Boring (a reference to David Boring, another comic created by Clowes). <b>The</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic. Clowes' attorney, Michael Kump, has since sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf's attorney, which LaBeouf posted on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, actress-comedian Olivia Munn began a tryout {{period on}} the show as a correspondent.

Carmon's column was denounced by Munn and the Daily Show female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a rebuttal {{on the show}}'s website in which they asserted that <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Daily Show office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate.

5|$|Ole Ewé, {{a former}} member of BOPA—another group in the Danish {{resistance}} movement—disagreed with <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attempt to kill the Gestapo leader Hoffman on the Roskildevej road. In the film, the car had Nazi flags, and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire. Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer. Flammen, who also received tips about the informer's whereabouts, appeared there and shot up the car. Ewé said that the man in the car was in civilian clothes and there were no Nazi flags on the car.|$|E
5|$|Specimens of B.ilicifolia {{were first}} {{collected}} by Scottish surgeon Archibald Menzies during {{the visit of}} the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791, but this collection {{did not result in}} <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species. It was next collected by Robert Brown in December 1801, during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound. The species was also drawn by the expedition's botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer. Like nearly all of Bauer's field drawings of Proteaceae, the original field sketch of B.ilicifolia was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945. A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E

5|$|Today {{the main}} {{building}} contains the University of London's Central Academic Bodies and activities, including {{the offices of the}} Vice-Chancellor of the University, the entire collection of the Senate House Library, and seven of the nine research institutes of the School of Advanced Study. During the Second World War, the building's use by the Ministry of Information inspired two noted English writers. Graham Greene's novel The Ministry of Fear (1943) and its film adaptation Ministry of Fear by Fritz Lang (1944) set in Bloomsbury. George Orwell's wife Eileen worked in Senate House for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information, and her experiences inspired <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Truth in Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately {{realize that they are}} experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E

5|$|Hermione {{identifies}} in Dumbledore's book {{a strange}} symbol also worn {{at the wedding}} by Xenophilius Lovegood. They visit him and are told the symbol represents the mythical Deathly Hallows, three objects from an old fairy tale titled The Tale of the Three Brothers: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, able to summon the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry realises Voldemort is seeking (and later successfully obtains) the Elder Wand, won by Dumbledore after Grindelwald's defeat, believing it {{will allow him to}} overpower the connection between his own wand and Harry's. Harry also recognises the Resurrection Stone as that found by Dumbledore which later become the second Hallow, and believes it to be hidden inside the Snitch Dumbledore left for him, but can't open it. <b>The</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak.|$|E
5|$|In {{the common}} {{presentation}} of acute low back pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending. The symptoms may start {{soon after the}} movements or upon waking up the following morning. <b>The</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point to diffuse pain. It {{may or may not}} worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs (known as sciatica) may be present. The first experience of acute low back pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40. This is often a person's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
