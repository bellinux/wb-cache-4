5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed {{with a flick of}} the wrist can in fact cause the crane <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, and the potential for an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
2500|$|Juries, the brokerages felt, {{could not}} {{understand}} the complexities of securities trading and law as well as arbitrators with experience in the industry. They saw arbitration as cheaper, faster yet still fair. [...] "he industry person is often likely <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> backward {{in favor of the}} customer," [...] said Edward Morris, director of arbitration for the New York Stock Exchange. More than half the time, the industry said, arbitration panels ruled in the customer's favor.|$|E

60|$|How {{strange and}} {{disturbing}} for Columbine <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> him, to slip her arms under him and lift him! It recalled a long-forgotten motherliness of her doll-playing days. And her face flushed hot.|$|E
60|$|Ellen was {{set down}} by-and-by. Her colour was very deep, {{but she looked}} gentle and happy, {{and the first thing}} she did was <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> Alfred, kiss him, and say how she wished he had been there.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the cave}} where saint Sree Potuluri Veera Brahmendra swamy wrote {{some of his}} Kala Gnaanam (prophecy). The height of the cave is less and one needs <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> half <b>over</b> <b>to</b> enter it.|$|R
60|$|She stepped {{close up}} <b>to</b> him, and <b>bending</b> <b>over</b> {{him as he}} sat there, crushed by realization, she lowered her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Janet,' he said presently, in his faint voice--he {{always called}} her Janet now. In {{a moment she}} was close <b>to</b> him, <b>bending</b> <b>over</b> him. He opened his hand as {{he looked up at}} her, and she placed hers within it.|$|R
60|$|Joe ran forward <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> the {{prostrate}} figure. The Indian, a slender, {{handsome young}} brave, {{had been shot}} through the breast.

60|$|Mr. Bucket {{eyed the}} old man for a moment--he had slipped and shrunk down in his chair into a mere bundle--as if he were much {{disposed}} to pounce upon him; nevertheless, he continued <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> him with the same agreeable air, keeping the corner {{of one of his}} eyes upon us.|$|E
60|$|Still she was silent. One {{hand was}} thrust deeper into its pocket, {{he saw a}} shudder run through her, and {{suddenly}} she burst into hysterical weeping, sinking into a chair. He stood for some moments helplessly regarding her before he gained {{the presence of mind}} to go to the door and lock it, returning <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> her.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} a great flame flashed out {{at the top of}} the tree: and finally, after about half an hour, the whole trunk, being all in a blaze, from top to bottom, began slowly <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> and <b>bend</b> <b>over.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{was never}} to know. Early the next morning Anne awakened <b>to</b> find Gilbert <b>bending</b> <b>over</b> her, fully dressed, and with an {{expression}} of anxiety on his face.|$|R
60|$|The Duke of Anjou, a slender, graceful {{young man}} in a gold-embroidered suit of violet, forgot the {{interest}} he was taking in his beautiful hands <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> lower <b>over</b> the handsome Madame de Nemours what time the unfriendly eyes of both were turned upon the Admiral.|$|R
60|$|Going {{over to the}} bed, Crispin {{drew the}} {{unconscious}} trooper's tuck-sword. He {{paused for a moment}} <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> the man's face; his breath came faintly, and Crispin knew that ere many moments were sped he would regain consciousness. He smiled grimly to see how well he had performed his work of suffocation without yet utterly destroying life.|$|E
60|$|But {{she could}} not answer. She watched him as he {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> the children, and when the smaller ones wept {{because they had to}} wait, he whispered in their ears, astonishing one or two into laughter. Some ceased crying and clung to him with dumb faith. And after the chosen hundred had been admitted he turned to her again.|$|E
60|$|Evening began <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> the scene; and {{the other}} {{inhabitants}} of the hamlet came out to draw water, their common well being in the public road opposite the garden and house of the Paddocks. Having wound up their bucketsfull respectively they lingered, and spoke significantly together. From their words any casual listener might have gathered information of what had occurred.|$|E
60|$|The {{youth and}} the trapper {{sat down and}} began to read the New Testament together, and to discuss its {{contents}} while supper was being prepared by their comrades.

6000|$|... [The bald CONSTABLE {{takes the}} little girls out by the [...] shoulders. The father follows them. The MAGISTRATE, {{returning}} [...] <b>to</b> his seat, <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> and talks <b>to</b> his CLERK inaudibly.] ...|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{the whole}} {{course of the}} river is paralleled by the Strada statale della Val Trebbia, highway SS45, running between Piacenza and Genoa. It {{encounters}} the river at Rivergaro and winds with it through the mountains, breaking away just below the source <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> southwest <b>over</b> the ridges to Genoa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jim," [...] she said: {{she spoke}} very low, {{and the boy}} had <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> her to hear, [...] "if you poke about {{in the middle of}} the {{mattress}} you'll find a couple of pounds. I saved them up a long while ago. That will pay for burying me. And, Jim, you'll take care of the kid. You won't let it go to the parish." ...|$|E
60|$|With a heavy spirit I crept out of bed, slowly {{disengaging}} Nick's arm lest {{he should}} wake. He {{turned over and}} sighed in his sleep. Carefully I dressed myself, and after I was dressed I could not refrain from slipping to the bedside <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> him once again,--for {{he was the only}} one in my life with whom I had found true companionship. Then I climbed carefully out of the window, and so down the corner of the house to the ground.|$|E
60|$|Driven {{to and fro}} between {{doubts and}} fears, the poor boy kept {{changing}} {{the course of the}} sloop {{in a way that would}} have soon rendered the hitting of the wreck an impossibility, when a sudden and rather sharp puff of wind caused the Nora <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>over,</b> and the foam to curl on her bow as she slipped swiftly through the water. Billy decided at that moment to miss the wreck when he was close upon it, and for that purpose deliberately and smartly put the helm hard a-starboard.|$|E
40|$|Traditional Indica rice {{varieties}} {{offered little}} chance of yield response to increased nitrogen fertilizer because they were prone <b>to</b> lodging (<b>bending</b> <b>over)</b> when they grew too tall. Development of dwarf rice cultivars with stiffer stems enabled rice farmers to increase yields with N inputs. Photos compare the tall and dwarf types and illustrate lodging...|$|R
6000|$|At {{two o'clock}} that night Carry was awakened <b>to</b> see Patty <b>bending</b> <b>over</b> her, flushed and radiant. Carry sat sleepily up. [...] "I hope {{you had a}} good time," [...] she said.|$|R
