40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{determine}} {{the association between}} recurrent group A streptococcal (GAS) <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> and serum 25 -hydroxy (25 (OH)) vitamin D among adult subjects. MethodsAdult patients with <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> between January 2007 and December 2009 were reviewed and identified retrospectively. Cases with a medical history of recurrent GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> were compared to age- and gender-matched individuals without a medical history of GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> Recurrent <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> was defined as three or more episodes of GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> per year {{for a period of}} two consecutive years. ResultsFifty-four cases with recurrent GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> and 50 controls were enrolled. There {{were no significant differences between}} cases and controls with regard to mean age (41 ± 13 vs. 42 ± 12 years; p= 0. 7) and male gender (55 % vs. 54 %; p= 0. 6). Mean serum levels of 25 (OH) vitamin D among subjects with recurrent GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> were significantly lower from the controls (11. 5 ng/ml± 4. 7 vs. 26 ng/ml± 7; p= 0. 001). Multiple regression analysis showed that a serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level < 20 ng/ml was associated with recurrent GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> (odds ratio 1. 62, 95 % confidence interval 1. 51 – 1. 76; p < 0. 001).

Thus, the objective of the work was to study the diagnostic value of general clinical and paraclinical indicators in verification of acute streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in children to optimize the initial etiotropic treatment and to prevent polypragmasy. Two clinical groups were formed: I group consisted of 10 children with a diagnosis of acute streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis,</b> II clinical group included 16 patients with acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> of non-streptococcal origin. The studies found that at the stage of early detection of acute streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in children the following clinical-paraclinical complex can be used: total score by McIsaac’s scale above 4, level of segmental leukocytes in the blood more than 50. 0  %, indices of stimulated test with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) of neutrophilic granulocytes in the blood by cytochemical coefficient below 0. 5 c. u., reserve of NBT-test less than 0, 15 c. u., which increases the risk of disease detection by four times...|$|E

40|$|Acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in {{children}} {{is one of}} the most common reasons for medical consultations. The majority of acute pharyngeal inflammatory diseases are viral. The frequency of bacterial <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> {{in children}} (the main causative agent is group A Streptococcus, GAS) is about 20 – 30 %. In spite of it antibiotics are prescribed for 95 % of patients, thus it is inappropriate. On the other hand misdiagnosis of acute streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> and antibiotics refusal can lead to suppurative and nonsuppurative rheumatic complications. Some prominent trials have shown a poor ability of signs and inflammatory biomarkers to identify <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> streptococcal vs. viral. So it is impossible to use them as indication for antibiotic. The experience of clinical score use (McIsaac etc.) have also demonstrated a poor prognostic value. As a result the throat swab culture is the «gold standard» of acute streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> It has such limitations as rare microbiology labs, method technology, the price and the delay in obtaining result.

40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) is {{the most}} {{important}} causative agent of <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> Beta-lactam antibiotics, particularly penicillin, are the drug of first choice and macrolides are recommended for patients who are allergic to penicillin. However, other antibiotics are also used for the treatment of streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> In recent years, the increase in the incidence of respiratory tract pathogens that are resistant to current antibacterial agents highlights the need to monitor the evolution of the resistance of these pathogens to antibiotics. In this study, we assess the susceptibility of 98 isolates of S. pyogenes to 16 antibiotics. The pathogens were recovered from patients with acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in Dakar, the Senegalese capital city, who were recruited from May 2005 to August 2006. All strains were susceptible to penicillin with low Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC = 0, 016 mg/L). Amoxicillin had high activity (100 %) showing its importance in treatment of streptococcal infections. Cephalosporins had MIC 90 values ranging from 0. 016 to 0. 094 mg/L. Macrolides have shown high activity. All strains were resistant to tetracyclin. Other molecules such as teicoplanin, levofloxacin and chloramphenicol were also active and would represent alternatives to treatment of <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> due to this pathogen. These results indicate that no significant resistance to antibiotics was found among patients with <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> studied in Dakar. Limitations of this study were that the number of isolates tested was small and all isolates were collected from one hospital in Dakar. Hence, results may not be representative of the isolates found, in the wider community or other regions of Senegal.

Despite extensive prescription, antibiotic therapy is indicated in less than one-fifth of these cases. New treatment strategies for patients with non-group-A-streptococcal acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> are therefore required. Objectives EPs 7630 is an extract from the roots of Pelargonium sidoides DC. After positive clinical study results in children with acute bronchitis, the present study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of EPs 7630 in the treatment of acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in children. Methods In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with a group sequential design, the efficacy and tolerability of EPs 7630 were investigated in 6 - to 10 -year-old patients with acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis,</b> who showed no evidence of group A β-hemolytic streptococcus. Treatment duration was 6 days. Primary efficacy variable was change in the sum score of the tonsillitis severity score (TSS) on day 4 compared to baseline. Results Overall, data on the change of the TSS measured for the EPs 7630 and placebo group were available for 60 and 64 children, respectively. After 4 days of treatment, the TSS had decreased from 9. 6 ± 1. 2 to 2. 8 ± 2. 6 points in the active medication group and from 9. 5 ± 1. 3 to 6. 1 ± 4. 1 points in the placebo group (P < 0. 001), indicating superiority of EPs 7630 over placebo.

40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} etiological {{factors and}} special issues of diagnostics of inflammatory {{diseases of the}} pharynx associated with pain in children. According to etiological factors <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> {{can be divided into}} two main forms: bacterial and viral. The prevalence of viral <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> is respectively high and, in contrast to bacterial form, this one does not demand systemic antibacterial treatment. The article contains information on the main medicines used for topical treatment of viral inflammation of the pharynx: saline solutions and antiseptic agents. The most appropriate topical antiseptic drug for children with <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> is combined ones with amylmetacresol and dichlorobenzyl alcohol, not lidocain-containing or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ones. The high analgesic effect of such combination is shown in various studies. Moreover, it was found, that hexylresorcinol and amylmetacresol inhibit sodium channels 10 - 20 times more intensely than lidocain. Significant analgesic effect of amylmetacresol/dichlorobenzyl alcohol is observed in 5 minutes after administration and its duration is 2 hours. Decrease of virulence of influenza A, respiratory syncytial and coronaviruses under exposure to amylmetacresol and dichlorobenzyl alcohol was also proved.

Emphasis was placed on the literature review of the problems and the modern limitations of rapid etiological diagnosis of tonsillitis in children, as well as the principles of efficient antibiotic therapy and disease prevention methods from the standpoint of evidence-based medicine. The paper noted that early detection of streptococcal etiology of <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> is of particular importance, it allows at the very beginning of the disease to prescribe efficient antibiotic therapy. This will reduce the duration of disease, significantly reduce the risk of early complications and significant reduce the period of contagiousness of the patient, which in turn reduces the likelihood of spreading of streptococcal infection. Gold standard for detection of β-hemolytic streptococcus for the administration of antibiotic therapy is streptotest.

It {{may be used for}} patients who have infections that require parenteral treatment but who are otherwise stable enough to not require admission as inpatients. Objective: We aimed to review the treatment of patients with acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> at the OPAT health care clinic in the Bahrain Defense Force Royal Medical Services (BDF-RMS), with regard to efficacy, patient satisfaction, cost effectiveness, and safety. Methods: A retrospective case notes review was conducted for all patients admitted to the OPAT clinic in the BDF-RMS with acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> treated with ceftriaxone, between March 2012 and March 2014. Results: In the period between March 2012 and March 2014, 97 patients with acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> were treated with ceftriaxone for a minimum of 3 days at the OPAT clinic. In total, 94. 8 % of patients completed the prescribed course of ceftriaxone. Total cure was achieved in 89. 7 % of patients. Usage of the OPAT clinic led to cost savings of 10, 693 BD, while total bed days saved were 301 over the 2 -year period examined by this study. Participants in the program expressed high satisfaction rates, and the average (± standard deviation) score on a patient satisfaction survey was 4. 41 (± 0. 31) {{out of a total of}} 5.

40|$|Background: Short course {{antimicrobial}} {{therapy is}} suggested for group A streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> Methods: The bacteriologic and clinical efficacies of clarithromycin [30 or 15 mg/kg/day twice daily (b. i. d.) ] or amoxicillin/clavulanate (43. 8 / 6. 2 mg/kg/day b. i. d.) for 5 days or penicillin V (30 mg/kg/day 3 times a day) for 10 days were compared. In a randomized, open label, parallel group, multicenter study, 626 children (2 - 16 years old) with <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> were enrolled; 537 were evaluable for efficacy. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 4 - 8 and 21 - 28 days after therapy. Results: At enrollment, 26 % of the Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were clarithromycin- nonsusceptible. All regimens had an apparently similar clinical efficacy. The long term S. pyogenes eradication rates were 102 of 123 (83 %) with amoxicillin/clavulanate and 88 of 114 (77 %) with penicillin V. In the 30 - and 15 -mg/kg/day clarithromycin groups, eradication occurred in 71 of 86 (83 %) and 59 of 80 (74 %) of the clarithromycin-susceptible isolates (P = 0. 33), and in 4 of 28 (14 %) and 5 of 26 (19 %) of the clarithromycin-resistant isolates, respectively (clarithromycin-susceptible versus -resistant, P < 0. 0001).

40|$|<b>Tonsillopharyngitis</b> is one of the main causes of medical appointments. In fact, a {{seemingly}} simple {{diagnosis and treatment}} causes various problems and is the reason of many problems and errors, including antibiotic misuse or overuse. The most frequent aetiological agents of pharyngitis relate to viruses. A carefully taken medical history and physical examination can help distinguish patients in whom bacterial (streptococcal) aetiology should be suspected. However, signs and symptoms themselves do not usually allow the correct diagnosis to be established. A clinical suspicion of bacterial infection must be confirmed microbiologically. The best practice is a throat culture. Rapid tests for the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes antigen are a convenient alternative. They are characterised by high sensitivity and specificity. The  first-line treatment in streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> is phenoxymethylpenicillin used for 10 days. Streptococcus pyogenes is uniformly sensitive to this antibiotic. Cefadroxil is reserved for patients with non-immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin and Streptococcus pyogenes carriers. Macrolides, in turn, should be used only if immediate hypersensitivity occurs. In this case, 3 – 5 -day treatment with azithromycin is a convenient alternative to clarithromycin. It is important to use its high, double doses – the standard dose is ineffective. Treatment of streptococcal <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> with amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and cefuroxime axetil is considered inappropriate and harmful. These are relatively broad-spectrum antibiotics, but their overuse is conductive to the spread of pneumococci of reduced penicillin sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs) are {{the most}} {{frequent}} of the community with major social and financial impact.

Experience evaluating the value of PCT as a marker of URTIs is limited. Approach: Forty patients with bacterial URTIs were studied in order to assess the role of PCT, measured by using the semi-quantitative test, as bacterial inflammation marker and to compare with other markers, such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP), White Blood Cell (WBC) counts and Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell counts. Results: In all cases, 22 with <b>tonsillopharyngitis,</b> 10 with peritonsillar abscess and 8 with rhinosinusitis, PCT levels remained below detection limits. On the other hand, serum CRP levels strongly correlated with body temperature, WBC and PMN cell counts. Patients with rhinosinusitis were older than those with peritonsillar abscess, had lower body temperature than those with <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> and had lower serum CRP levels than patients with either peritonsillar abscess or <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> Conclusion: Therefore CRP could be used as a marker to predict the severity of URTIs while PCT, although promising in cases of other severe bacterial infections, did not prove to be suitable for patients with less severe or localized infections, such as URTIs...|$|E

40|$|In 2012, 28 out of 140 staff {{working for}} a film crew in a Beijing movie and {{television}} base experienced a sudden onset of fever, sore throat, and/or tiredness, headache within the 24 hour period of July 26 – 27. All of the patients visited the hospital and were diagnosed as having <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> On July 28, 2012, a team of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff arrived and initiated an outbreak investigation. Pharyngeal swabs were obtained from patients for microbiologic analysis. All isolates of the outbreak were analyzed for toxin-genes and drug-resistance genes by polymerase chain reaction, and were performed for the emm typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing. On July 30, 2012, Group A Streptococcus was isolated from eight of the 16 throat swab specimens obtained on site. These isolates {{were found to have}} the same genotype emm 89.

40|$|Background: Tularemia is {{a disease}} caused by a Gram-negative {{coccobacillus}} Francisella tularensis. This bacterium may cause different types of clinical pictures owing to acquisition route and entrance site, such as ulceroglandular, oropharyngeal, glandular, pneumonic, typhoid and ocular forms. Oropharyngeal tularemia (OPT) {{is the most common}} form of tularemia in some regions. OPT may cause <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> followed by cervical lymphadenopathies (LAPs). Without treatment LAP may persist for several months and may mimic other diseases causing cervical LAPs. Materials and Methods: A total of six cases of OPT, five male and one female, between 21 and 31 years old, diagnosed serologically and clinically recorded in GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital were included in this study. Detailed story including the region they lived for last 6 months, their occupation, family and neighborhood story with similar complaints were obtained. Patient data were also obtained from manually written patients files and electronical patient file system. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks of all biopsy material were submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study for F. tularensis. Results: A total of six cases with head and neck mass following a story of <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> admitted to different clinics including infectious diseases, ear-nose-throat and internal medicine in our tertiary care hospital. Physical examination revealed immobile, hard, conglomerated unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy in all cases. Histopathological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation in four cases. Acute suppurative inflammatory changes were also seen in two cases. Large necrotic areas mimicking casseifying necrosis were seen in two cases. PCR amplification of F. tularensis genom from isolated deoxyribonucleic acids was successful in five cases. Conclusion: Tularemia should be kept in mind in patients with <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> not responding to penicillins and beta lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, persisting LAPs mimicking tumor with or without the story of previously experienced sore throat or <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in past few days or weeks should be evaluated for glandular or OPT. At this point, easily applicable serological tests such as tularemia micro-agglutination tests will confirm the diagnosis of OPT. However, if lymph node were already sampled to exclude especially malignancy or T cell lymphoma, tularemia PCR test may be used to make a certain diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in children, and {{approximately}} 20 % {{of this population}} are chronic carriers of GAS. Antibacterial therapy has previously {{been shown to be}} insufficient at clearing GAS carriage. Bacterial biofilms are a surface-attached bacterial community that is encased in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. Biofilms have been shown to provide a protective niche against the immune response and antibiotic treatments, and are often associated with recurrent or chronic bacterial infections. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that GAS is present within tonsil tissue at the time of tonsillectomy. Methods Blinded immunofluorescent and histological methods were employed to evaluate palatine tonsils from children undergoing routine tonsillectomy for adenotonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis.</b> Results Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-GAS antibody was positive in 11 / 30 (37 %) children who had tonsillectomy for adenotonsillar hypertrophy and in 10 / 30 (33 %) children who had tonsillectomy for recurrent GAS pharyngitis. Fluorescent microscopy with anti-GAS and anti-cytokeratin 8 & 18 antibodies revealed GAS was localized to the tonsillar reticulated crypts. Scanning electron microscopy identified 3 -dimensional communities of cocci similar in size and morphology to GAS. The characteristics of these communities are similar to GAS biofilms from in vivo animal models. Conclusion Our study revealed the presence of GAS within the tonsillar reticulated crypts of approximately one-third of children who underwent tonsillectomy for either adenotonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent GAS <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> at the Wake Forest School of Medicine. Trial Registration The tissue collected was normally discarded tissue and no patient identifiers were collected. Thus, no subjects were formally enrolled. </p...|$|E

Clinical isolates of S. pyogenes (n = 590) obtained from throat swab samples on study entry were tested for their in-vitro susceptibility to telithromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. Telithromycin demonstrated in-vitro activity against the clinical isolates of S. pyogenes (MIC 50 / 90 0. 03 / 0. 06 mg/L) higher than clarithromycin or azithromycin (MIC 50 / 90 0. 06 / 0. 06 mg/L and 0. 12 / 0. 25 mg/L, respectively), including erythromycin-resistant strains. At the post-therapy/test of cure (TOC) visit (days 16 - 23), satisfactory bacteriological outcome was demonstrated for 88. 3 % (234 / 265) and 88. 6 % (225 / 254) of telithromycin- and comparator-treated patients, respectively (per-protocol population). Overall, GABHS eradication rates were 88. 7 % (235 / 265) for telithromycin and 89. 0 % (226 / 254) for comparators. The clinical cure rates at the post-therapy/TOC visit were 93. 6 % (248 / 265) and 90. 9 % (220 / 242) for telithromycin and pooled comparators, respectively. Telithromycin was generally well-tolerated. Most adverse events considered to be possibly related to study medication were gastrointestinal and of mild intensity. Discontinuations as a result of adverse events were few in both treatment groups. In conclusion, telithromycin 800 mg once-daily for 5 days was as effective as penicillin V or clarithromycin for 10 days {{in the treatment of}} GABHS <b>tonsillopharyngitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|There was studied an {{expediency}} and diagnostic {{value of}} using an intensity of clinical symptoms, general blood analysis, interleikin- 6 and - 8 {{content in the}} blood serum for the early diagnostics of the acute nonstreptococcus tonsillopharyngites in children. The aim of the work was to study the diagnostic value of the general clinical and paraclinical indicators in verification of nonstreptococcus etiology of acute tonsillopharyhgites in children and for optimization of its treatment. Methods. There were examined 98 patients with acute tonsillopharyngites: 66 persons with nonstreptococcus etiology and 32 children with diagnosis “acute streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis”. The streptococcus etiology was proved by the positive result of cultural study of throat swab. As auxiliary paraclinical criteria of confirmation of nonstreptococcus etiology of ATP in patients of comparison group were analyzed the indices of general blood analysis and interleikin- 6 (IL- 6) and IL- 8 content in the blood serum. Results. The intensity of clinical symptoms that were assessed on MacIsaac scale and indices of the general blood analysis cannot be used independently for the early diagnostics of ATP of nonstreptococcus etiology because of insufficient sensitivity of these methods. The development of acute nonstreptococcus <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> in children is attended with the normal indices of interleikin- 6 concentration and the lowered interleikin- 8 content in the blood serum. Conclusions. To determine the tactics of starting treatment in children with symptoms of acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> {{it can be used}} the next clinical and paraclinical complex: the general sum of points on MacIsaac scale, interleikin- 6 level, and IL- 8 content in the blood serum. An increase of IL- 6 level and decrease of IL- 8 content in the blood serum of patients with acute <b>tonsillopharyngitis</b> increases more than twice the detection of nonstreptococcus etiology of disease in children</p...|$|E
