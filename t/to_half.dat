5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E
5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park <b>to</b> <b>half</b> the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the mineral {{contents}} of various edible mushrooms found that C.micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34species tested, close <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can bioaccumulate detrimental heavy metals like lead and cadmium, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 30 {{tropical}} depressions formed in 1984 in the Western Pacific, of which 27 became tropical storms, 16 reached typhoon intensity, and two reached super typhoon strength. Eight tropical cyclones moved into mainland China, four struck Vietnam, four {{moved through the}} Philippines, and one cyclone moved into South Korea. The second consecutive typhoon season with a late start, all of the season activity was contained between June and December, with August and October the most active months, contributing <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the seasonal tropical cyclone count.|$|E
5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one—oxygen—makes up close <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E

5|$|Among other pursuits, amateur dramatics {{flourish}} (even though Brasenose was an all-male college). Overall, {{the intake}} and careers of undergraduates remained {{dominated by the}} Church (up <b>to</b> <b>half),</b> drawn {{from a range of}} backgrounds. The college remained largely independent of the large public schools. Brasenose's academic record remained solid, if unremarkable; its strengths lay in classics, although one of its most prominent academics– Arthur Evans– studied modern history.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E
5|$|By the 2000s most of Oliver's output {{constituted}} commissioned pieces, whether {{public or}} private. The most substantial {{of these is}} Vine, a 16.5metre high sculpture installed {{as part of the}} $400 million refurbishment of the Sydney Hilton. Taking twelve months to create and requiring a budget of up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> million dollars, the work was completed in 2005. The sculpture was fabricated from 380 kilograms of aluminium, and assembled by a team of eight Croatian welders.|$|E

50|$|During {{positive}} climb, {{the crystal}} shrinks {{in the direction}} perpendicular <b>to</b> the extra <b>half</b> plane of atoms because atoms are being removed from the half plane. Since negative climb involves an addition of atoms <b>to</b> the <b>half</b> plane, the crystal grows in the direction perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>half</b> plane. Therefore, compressive stress in the direction perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>half</b> plane promotes positive climb, while tensile stress promotes negative climb. This is one main difference between slip and climb, since slip is caused by only shear stress.|$|R
50|$|Woodworth {{is remembered}} {{with a large}} burial vault at Evergreen Cemetery, {{designed}} by A.C. Thompson, a leading memorialist of his time.

5|$|Casualties were {{heaviest}} {{among the}} troops landing {{at either end}} of Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies were reduced <b>to</b> <b>half</b> strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down <b>to</b> <b>half</b> strength.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower was commercially successful, selling close <b>to</b> <b>half</b> {{a million}} copies. Kono {{attributed}} {{some of this}} success to Resident Evil generating interest in horror games {{and the success of}} the PlayStation. Critical reviews of Clock Tower were mixed. The game's horror atmosphere and storyline were praised, although most other aspects were found to be mediocre. Most of the negative critique was directed towards the game's slow pace, which was compared unfavorably to other PlayStation games of the era, particularly the more action-oriented and fast-paced Resident Evil. These factors influenced some critics to recommend Clock Tower purely for point-and-click adventure fans.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E

5|$|From 1999 to 2003, several Palestinian {{suicide attacks}} {{took place in}} Haifa (in Maxim and Matza restaurants, bus 37, and others), killing 68 civilians. In 2006, Haifa was hit by 93 Hezbollah rockets during the Second Lebanon War, killing 11 civilians and leading <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the city's {{population}} fleeing {{at the end of}} the first week of the war. Among the places hit by rockets were a train depot and the oil refinery complex.|$|E
