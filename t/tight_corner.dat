500|$|The most {{significant}} moment during the chase came [...] from the finish, when several riders fell on a <b>tight</b> <b>corner.</b> These included Tejay van Garderen (BMC), who was helped {{to return to}} the peloton by his teammates. Another rider caught up in the incident was Ben King (...) , who stood {{by the side of the}} road waiting for his team to bring him a new bike. While he was waiting, one spectator stole his bicycle computer and another attempted to ride off on his bike, although a mechanical problem stopped him.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Happiness" [...] starts at {{a train station}} (Roma Street railway station in Brisbane) with a boy and girl {{stepping}} off a train. As the pair leave the train, the boy turns and tries to reach for something, but the girl pulls him back. It is shown that he was reaching for a [...] slinky. The slinky leaves the train, and passes Middleton busking in the train station. The slinky ventures to find the boy, facing a range of challenges along the way; these include avoiding fruit falling on it and riding a skateboard. In {{the middle of the}} music clip, the slinky is shown making its way through a music room in which Powderfinger are performing [...] "My Happiness". It rests on the bar and the band finishes playing, while the background music continues. As Powderfinger leaves, the slinky is picked up by Haug. He gets into a car and places the slinky on the car's dashboard, but it falls out the window as the car turns a <b>tight</b> <b>corner.</b> It lands outside the gate of a house and is picked up and brought inside to the boy.|$|E

Proposed use of pressure-localizing insert allows composite laminates to be compacted into <b>tight</b> <b>corners</b> by conventional pressure or vacuum-bagging techniques.

500|$|The [...] "Prophecy of Blood" [...] {{is unusual}} in two ways: {{it is the first}} of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies to feature a repeating [...] "refrain"; and it is carved {{backwards}} in a <b>tight</b> <b>corner</b> of the prophecy room, so that a mirror is required to read it. Nerissa tells Gregor she believes Sandwich purposely made it [...] "difficult to read" [...] in order to emphasize {{how difficult it is to}} understand, and Gregor later hypothesizes that Sandwich forced the humans to read it using mirrors so that, as a person read, [...] " [...] would see [...] ". Ripred similarly points out that an [...] "annoying little dance" [...] Boots makes up to go along with the prophecy's refrain echoes this theme, by forcing the questers to turn and see themselves before they realize that the plague originated with the humans. Boots's [...] "help" [...] deciphering this prophecy leads characters to rely on her to do the same in the series's later books. In Gregor and the Marks of Secret, Boots begins dancing to a song Sandwich carved [...] "in the nursery, not the room of prophecies" [...] after the characters witness the mass execution of a group of nibblers and becomes [...] "totally convinced" [...] that the song is actually yet another prophecy. In Gregor and the Code of Claw, when the [...] "Prophecy of Time" [...] calls for a [...] "princess" [...] to crack a cryptogram, Boots is immediately assigned the role because of her importance to the last two prophecies, despite the fact that she is still a toddler.|$|E
2500|$|Foreign {{minister}} said [...] "this is a disproportionate {{response to what}} has happened and if both sides are going to drive each other into a <b>tight</b> <b>corner</b> then I think that all this will develop in a very dramatic and tragic way."

2500|$|When {{the relief}} road opened, {{the section of}} the A151 in the town centre was renumbered. However, ever since then, some {{published}} road maps are incorrect. The A151 now follows Cherry Holt Road, it no longer continues to the town centre. The only reliable map is the Ordnance Survey: [...] The error seems also to affect satellite navigation systems, causing large lorries to attempt a <b>tight</b> <b>corner</b> in the town centre rather than keeping to the correct roads.|$|E

2500|$|He punctuated his {{dominance}} in La Flèche Wallonne {{by winning the}} race for the fourth consecutive year and the fifth time overall. A few days later in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Valverde fended off a late attack from Dan Martin and managed to outsprint him at the line and take his fourth win in the event. After taking time off from racing to train at a 25-day altitude camp at Sierra Nevada, Valverde raced in the Critérium du Dauphiné, where in the stage four time trial he clocked the third best time, losing out only to world time trial champion Tony Martin (...) and 's Richie Porte by twelve and twenty-four seconds respectively. He managed to put time into the rest of his general classification rivals, including Contador, Bardet, and most notably, defending champion Chris Froome (...) [...] Over the subsequent mountain stages, Valverde was consistently aggressive, however it failed to pay off {{and by the end of}} the Dauphiné he was 4 minutes 8 seconds down on 's Jakob Fuglsang, in ninth place overall. Going into the Tour de France, Valverde stated that he would work for his teammate Nairo Quintana, however he was still considered an outside bet for the final podium by many pundits. On the opening individual time trial stage, Valverde crashed on a <b>tight</b> <b>corner</b> and was forced to abandon the Tour immediately; his first Grand Tour withdrawal since 2006. He suffered a fractured kneecap, ruling him out for several months. Ultimately, Valverde opted to end his 2017 season because of his knee injury with the hope of making his comeback at the start of the 2018 season.|$|E

5000|$|Bogies are four-wheeled, {{articulated}} carriages {{beneath the}} main load bed. They allow a long wagon to carry long loads, but still have individually short wheelbases, and so go round <b>tight</b> <b>corners.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Wegg and Thompson bought it. I {{was angry}} at the time, because their {{withdrawal}} had driven me into a <b>tight</b> <b>corner</b> to protect my investment, and I told them they would bitterly regret their action. I think Wegg agreed with me, but Will Thompson was still stubborn.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{positive}} luxury at times," [...] Redford answered, [...] "to be able to indulge in absolute candour. We cannot last the session.

50|$|A {{decorator}} judges {{the quality}} of a brush based on several factors: filament retention, paint pickup, steadiness of paint release, brush marks, drag and precision painting. A chiseled brush permits the painter to cut into <b>tighter</b> <b>corners</b> and paint more precisely.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to shields, each racing craft contains air brakes for navigating <b>tight</b> <b>corners,</b> {{as well as}} [...] "Hyperthrust" [...] option.

6000|$|To all appearances, {{this was}} a <b>tight</b> <b>corner,</b> but Jimmy fancied that he saw {{his way out of}} it. Meanwhile, the {{situation}} appealed to him.

60|$|Jimmy {{placed the}} pearls {{carefully}} on the dressing table. Then he turned to Sir Thomas, {{with his hands in}} the pockets of his coat.
