5|$|The next {{stretch of}} State Route 664 {{is full of}} bends, and <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{continuously}} turns at a constant rate. At an intersection with another Honey Suckle Lane, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> starts its northwestern progression once again. This changes again when Tedrow Lane begins paralleling <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Now following a steady northeastern alignment, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> continues through the large patches of trees south of Haneyville. At Little Plum Run Road, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> turns onto a steady northward alignment. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> continues through the trees for a while, continuing northward {{on its way to}} Gallagher Township.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{is still}} under state jurisdiction, M-155 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 13,699vehicles used <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> daily in Howell and 3,960vehicles did so each day near the souther terminus, the highest and lowest counts along <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> respectively. No section of OLD M-155 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|At Trenton, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{crosses the}} Trent Canal {{and returns to}} an {{agricultural}} setting. It then crosses the Moira River as it goes through Belleville before heading eastward to Kingston. The Kingston portion of <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> originally named the Kingston-Bypass, {{was one of the}} first sections of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> to be completed; it is now mostly three lanes each way.|$|E

5|$|At {{a bend in}} <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> {{there is}} a small patch of development, with a few houses near <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large patch of forests in the surroundings come towards a clearing, where <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> passes a small patch of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Highway61 in the south, {{the route}} {{proceeds}} straight north along a concession road midway between Monteith Road {{to the west}} and Hanna Road to the east. Surrounded almost entirely by farmland, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> encounters McCluskey Drive onekilometre (0.62mi) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive twokilometres north of that. At the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> At Barrie Drive, twokilometres north of the community, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given the right of way at the intersection. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic the right of way at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|By 1951, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{had been}} reconstructed {{generally}} along MT 87's present location, {{and it had}} been upgraded to an improved gravel road. In 1959, the road in the location of MT 87 was rapidly improved in order to serve as an alternate routing to U.S. Route 287. Portions of US 287 around Hebgen Lake collapsed and crumbled {{as a result of the}} 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. After US 287 was fixed, the highway's importance decreased. In 1962, the portions of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> from the southern terminus to present-day milepost 8.395 were reconstructed along the current location. In 1967, the rest of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> was reconstructed along the present location. By 1987, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> had been numbered as MT 87. The route had also been paved.|$|E

5|$|Continuing northward in Montevideo, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{turns back}} to the east between J. Harley Smith and Lagoon parks. MN29 {{separates}} at the intersection between Washington Avenue and 8th Street, and MN7 continues eastward on Washington through residential areas. The avenue passes the hospital before leaving town. The street name attached to <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> in rural Chippewa County is 50th Street as MN7 runs due east through farm country. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> crosses another line of the BNSF Railway and MN23 in Clara City before meandering southwesterly to follow 60th Street near Bunde. East of this unincorporated community, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> crosses into Kandiyohi County. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> follows 195th Avenue through {{the southern part of the}} county, passing through the communities of Prinsburg and Lake Lillian. In between, it passes south of Blomkest where it intersects US71.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{does not}} enter the City of Toronto proper, Toronto {{is used as a}} control city in Halton and Durham Regions due to the similar sizes of the {{suburban}} municipalities <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> passes through making selection of an obvious example among them difficult.|$|E
5|$|From that junction, M-71 turns easterly {{and then}} southeasterly out of town. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> {{continues}} to run alongside the rail line through farmland to {{the outskirts of}} Vernon. M-71 crosses the Shiawassee River for a second time. The rail line and <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> diverge and run on opposite sides of town; <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> rounds the northeast side and the rail line runs along the southwest side. This section of trunkline through Vernon had the lowest AADT value in 2009 with 4,371vehicles. M-71 continues to the interchange with I-69 at exit118 northwest of Durand, where <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> designation terminates. No part of M-71 has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Highways</b> Act 1555 (2 & 3 Ph. & Mary, c. 8), {{sometimes}} the First Statute of Highways, was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of England passed in 1555 (and extended by <b>the</b> <b>Highways</b> Act 1562).

50|$|Route 2 {{begins at}} a dead end near the Tanana River at Manley Hot Springs, where <b>the</b> Elliott <b>Highway</b> begins. Until <b>the</b> {{junction}} with <b>the</b> Dalton <b>Highway</b> (Alaska Route 11) at Livengood, Route 2 is a minor road used only for local access; beyond Livengood it carries traffic to and from <b>the</b> Dalton <b>Highway.</b> At <b>the</b> junction with Alaska Route 6 (Steese <b>Highway)</b> at Fox, <b>the</b> Elliott <b>Highway</b> ends and Route 2 follows <b>the</b> Steese <b>Highway</b> south into Fairbanks. <b>The</b> Steese <b>Highway</b> becomes <b>the</b> Richardson <b>Highway</b> at Airport Way, the former route of <b>the</b> Parks <b>Highway</b> (Alaska Route 3). <b>The</b> Parks <b>Highway</b> junction is now about a mile south along <b>the</b> Richardson <b>Highway,</b> which then leaves Fairbanks to the southeast. In Delta Junction, at the northwest end of <b>the</b> Alaska <b>Highway,</b> Route 2 leaves <b>the</b> Richardson <b>Highway</b> for <b>the</b> Alaska <b>Highway,</b> while <b>the</b> Richardson <b>Highway</b> continues south as Alaska Route 4. After passing the ends of <b>the</b> Tok Cut-Off <b>Highway</b> (Alaska Route 1) at Tok and <b>the</b> Taylor <b>Highway</b> (Alaska Route 5) just beyond, Route 2 becomes Yukon <b>Highway</b> 1 at <b>the</b> Canada-US border.|$|R

5|$|In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> was {{truncated}} as the terminus was {{scaled back}} to M-125 in Monroe. Finally on October 4, 2006, {{the section of}} M-50 between M-125 and US24 was also removed, shortening <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> by about a mile (1.9km).|$|E
5|$|In Alder, MT 287 {{leaves the}} valley of the Ruby River and heads east through Alder Gulch, a narrow valley along which <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> ascends the more {{moderate}} mountains between the Tobacco Root Mountains to the north and the Gravelly Range to the south. The length of the valley is filled with tailings, or small hills of mining waste left behind by gold dredge placer mining over decades of mining. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> passes through the village of Nevada City, the site of the Finney House and the Dr. Don L. Byam House. MT 287 follows the Alder Gulch Short Line Railroad, an isolated narrow-gauge railway, until the route reaches Virginia City. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> enters the town on Nevada Street but mainly follows Wallace Street through the Virginia City Historic District, a National Historic Landmark preserving buildings of Montana's second territorial capital. MT 287 leaves Virginia City and ascends to its highest point along Daylight Creek. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> descends into {{the valley of}} the Madison River along Eightmile Creek. MT 287 meets the northern end of S-249 (Varney Road) where <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> curves north on arriving at the Madison River. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> enters the town of Ennis along Bauer Lane and curves east onto West Main Street before reaching its eastern terminus at US 287, which heads north and east along Main Street.|$|E
5|$|In Bay County, M-15 follows Tuscola Road {{where it}} meets the western {{terminus}} of M-138 which runs along Munger Road in Munger. As <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> enters Bay City on the southeast side of town, Tuscola Road leaves the farmlands for residential areas of Bay City. The roadway runs northerwesterly near the St. Stanislaus, St. Patrick and Elm Lawn cemeteries, before turning north on Trumbull Street at 10th Street. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> follows Trumbull Street for five blocks, where <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> designation ends at a four-way intersection with M-25/Center Avenue.
