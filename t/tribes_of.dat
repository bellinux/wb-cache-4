5|$|In Ireland, Dál Riata formed part of Ulster, {{ruled by}} Báetán mac Cairill of the Dál Fiatach. The other major {{grouping}} in Ulster were the disunited <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> the Cruithne, later {{known as the}} Dál nAraidi. The most important Cruithne king in Áedán's time was Fiachnae mac Báetáin. Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> the Uí Néill and their subjects and allies.

5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the <b>Tribes</b> <b>of</b> the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the <b>Tribes</b> <b>of</b> the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E
5|$|Christian princes {{continued}} to make gains in the Iberian peninsula: the King of Portugal, AfonsoI, captured Lisbon and Raymond BerenguerIV of Barcelona conquered the city of Tortosa.

The Wends were finally defeated in 1162.|$|E
5|$|Conquering {{the peoples}} of the Alps in 16BC was another {{important}} victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the Elbe River by 9BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body {{all the way back to}} Rome.|$|E

5|$|Even before non-aboriginal {{people came}} to the region, the Kootenay River valley was an {{important}} path of trade and transport between the <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> the Canadian Rockies and the Idaho Panhandle, mostly between the Ktunaxa (who practiced agriculture and aquaculture) and the Salish, Blackfeet and Pend d'Oreilles {{of the south and}} east, and with the Shuswap in the north. The physiographic continuation of the Kootenai Valley southwards from present-day Bonners Ferry, Idaho into the Pend Oreille basin via the Purcell Trench formed a natural corridor through which natives of the area could interact. The barrier formed by the Rocky Mountains to the east, however, meant that <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> the area, especially the Ktunaxa, were economically and linguistically isolated from the Great Plains tribes (with the exception of the Shoshone, whose territory spanned both sides of the Rockies).|$|E
5|$|Following an 1846 treaty, the Winnebago <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> Iowa were {{relocated}} to the Long Prairie reservation in central Minnesota {{in the late}} 1840s establishing an important presence in the territory.

Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility. The name of the Nez Perce tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe. The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama.

5|$|Massachusetts was {{originally}} inhabited by <b>tribes</b> <b>of</b> the Algonquian language family {{such as the}} Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett.

Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses, and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.|$|E
