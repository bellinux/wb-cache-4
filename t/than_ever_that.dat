When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from {{the convention}}. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense {{of their right to}} reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.|$|E
500|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{who believed that}} modern humans evolved [...] "Out of Asia", Dubois thought that gibbons were closest to humans among the great apes. To preserve the proportions predicted by his theory of brain evolution, Dubois argued that Java Man was shaped more like a gibbon than a human. Imagined [...] "with longer arms and a greatly expanded chest and upper body", the Trinil creature became a gigantic ape of about , but [...] "double cephalization of the anthropoid apes in general and half that of man". It was therefore halfway {{on the path to}} becoming a modern human. As Dubois concluded his 1932 paper: [...] "I still believe, now more firmly <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>that</b> the Pithecanthropus of Trinil is the real 'missing link.'" ...|$|E
500|$|However, on {{his return}} to Stockholm in 1535, the king had {{prominent}} Germans imprisoned and accused Petri of replacing the law with his own [...] "act of faith". [...] In response, Petri warned his followers that the lords and princes interpreted his sermons as rebellious and complained about {{the ease with which}} punishment and subversion were carried through, while restoring [...] "what rightly and true is" [...] was much harder. [...] In a sermon published in 1539, Petri criticized the misuse of the name of God [...] "now commonly established", a message clearly addressed to the king. [...] Petri also explained to his congregation that the Devil ruled the world more obviously <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>that</b> God would punish the authorities and those who obeyed them, and that the world had become so wicked that it was irrevocably doomed.|$|E

She locks Beth inside the room, opens the bathroom door, and leaves Beth alone {{to make her own}} choice. She advises the pain will never subside, [...] "but you make room for it". Beth attempts suicide by using a shard of broken mirror to cut her wrist, but Maggie and Lori manage to pry the bathroom door open in time to save Beth, who is bleeding profusely but relatively okay. Andrea returns to the house to check on Beth and is confronted by a furious Maggie. Andrea reasons that she allowed Beth to explore her choices, and Beth is now more convinced <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> suicide is not an option. Maggie condemns Andrea's actions and forbids her from ever again setting foot inside the house.|$|E
500|$|In January 1965, McGovern {{made his}} first major address on Vietnam, saying that [...] "We are not winning in South Vietnam... I am very much opposed to the policy, now gaining support in Washington, of {{extending}} the war to the north." [...] McGovern instead proposed a five-point plan advocating a negotiated settlement involving a federated Vietnam with local autonomy and a UNpresence to guarantee security and fair treatment. The speech gave McGovern national visibility {{as one of the}} [...] "doves" [...] in the debate over Vietnam. However, McGovern made moderate-to-hawkish statements at times too, flatly rejecting unconditional withdrawal of U.S.forces and criticizing anti-war draft-card burnings as [...] "immature, impractical, and illegal". He eschewed personal criticism of Johnson. In November 1965, McGovern traveled to South Vietnam for three weeks. The human carnage he saw in hospital wards deeply upset him, and he became increasingly outspoken about the war upon his return, more convinced <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> Vietnam was a political, not military, problem. Now he was ready, as he later said, [...] "not merely to dissent, but to crusade" [...] against the war.|$|E
500|$|Kelefa Sanneh wrote a lukewarm {{review of}} the album in The New York Times, believing that Jay-Z's {{reluctance}} to indulge in the gangsta rap lyricism of his past resulted in wavering, equivocal songs such as [...] "No Hook" [...] and [...] "Say Hello". [...] "Once, words just seemed to flow out of him, as if he couldn't help himself", Sanneh wrote. [...] "Now it's clearer <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> he's choosing them carefully." [...] Louis Pattison of NME was more critical and called it a regression from the [...] "slightly bloated" [...] Kingdom Come, lamenting the shortage of [...] "don't-give-a-fuck attitude" [...] highlighted on [...] "Success" [...] in favor of less effective raps exploiting Jay-Z's entrepreneurial personage. In MSN Music, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Say Hello" [...] and [...] "Blue Magic" [...] as highlights while humorously using sampled film dialogue from the latter track to frame his lukewarm opinion of the album: [...] "Jay-Z, that's a brand name, like Pepsi, that's a brand name – he stands behind it, he guarantees it, even if you don't know him {{any more than you}} know the chairman of Universal Music".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from review website The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, {{saying that it}} was [...] "a funny episode that managed to be only fitfully satisfying." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White commented that [...] "it's more apparent <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> 'Goodbye, Michael' should have ended the season, if not the series," [...] and that [...] "the show is just spinning its wheels now". Despite this, she praised the scenes featuring Creed Bratton and James Spader, believing Bratton's performance consisted of [...] "the funniest scenes of the episode", and that Spader [...] "was given the meatiest part, gamely channeling his dominating boss role from Secretary". White ultimately gave the episode a 6.5/10, calling it [...] "Okay". TV Squad writer Joel Keller criticized the episode for not featuring a true plot, writing that [...] "this felt like a series of sketches in search of a plot." [...] The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais also commented on the outlandishness, particularly Warren Buffett's appearance, saying [...] "If you're going to jump a shark, jump a big one." [...] He also compared the episode to the Chris Martin episode of Gervais's other series, Extras. The shark quote was repeated multiple times on other media outlets; Gervais eventually commented that [...] "I fucking didn't , that's for sure." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "Next Time Now!" [...] {{led to a}} much {{expanded}} production retitled Closer <b>Than</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>that</b> was co-directed by Maltby and Smith. This production began its life at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts during the Summer of 1989. It came to New York the following Fall, opening in previews on 17 October 1989, and officially opening on 6 November 1989 at the off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre, where it ran for 312 performances. The cast included Brent Barrett, Sally Mayes, Richard Muenz, and Lynne Wintersteller.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} home in February 1919 he stated, [...] "I {{have come from}} France more firmly {{convinced}} <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> Negros should write Negro music.

We won France by playing music which was ours and not a pale imitation of others, and if we are to develop in America we must develop along our own lines." [...] In 1919 Europe made more recordings for Pathé Records. These include both instrumentals and accompaniments with vocalist Noble Sissle who, with Eubie Blake, would later have great success with their 1921 production of Shuffle Along, which gives us the classic song [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry". Differing in style from Europe's recordings of a few years earlier, they incorporate blues, blue notes, and early jazz influences (including a rather stiff cover record of the Original Dixieland Jass Band's [...] "Clarinet Marmalade").|$|E

2500|$|On February 9, 2011, Cooke {{was given}} a four-game {{suspension}} for a hit from behind on Columbus Blue Jackets' defenceman Fedor Tyutin. On March 21, Cooke was suspended for the final ten games of the Penguins' regular season schedule, {{as well as the}} first round of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, stemming from an elbow to the head of New York Rangers defenceman Ryan McDonagh. The suspension was the longest of Cooke's career and was supported by the Penguins. Penguins General Manager Ray Shero said in a statement that the hit was [...] "exactly the kind of hit we're trying to get out of the game," [...] and that Penguins officials had told Cooke [...] "in no uncertain terms" [...] that such play was [...] "unacceptable." [...] Speaking to two Pittsburgh newspapers the day after the incident, Cooke apologized for the hit. [...] "I realize and understand, more so now <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>that</b> I need to change," [...] Cooke said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Don McLean covered [...] "Crying" [...] in {{a version}} which {{unexpectedly}} {{went to the}} top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts. Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison took a chance and embarked on a tour of Bulgaria. He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of Sofia. Later that year, he and Emmylou Harris won a Grammy Award for their duet [...] "That Lovin' You Feelin' Again" [...] (from the comedy film Roadie, in which Orbison also had a cameo role). It was his first such award, and he felt more <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> the time was ripe for his full return to popular music. However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{suit was}} {{heard by the}} only Republican judge in East Baton Rouge Parish, Douglas Gonzales, a former federal attorney. Gonzales threw out three hundred Lambert votes in three precincts in St. Helena Parish (one of the Florida parishes) because Lambert's total in each precinct {{increased}} by one hundred votes between election night, October 27, {{and the release of}} the final tabulation on October 30. Gonzales, however, dismissed the suit and told the lieutenant governor: [...] "You have proven your courage and integrity, but the facts have not proven your case." [...] Gonzales added that he took his action [...] "with a sad heart." [...] After attempts at appeal, Fitzmorris realized that he would not achieve his lifelong dream of becoming governor. He told the media: [...] "I am now more convinced <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> this election was stolen from Jimmy Fitzmorris." [...] The Fitzmorris-Lambert rivalry aided Treen in securing support in the general election against Lambert. The dispute created a major issue of the governor's race: election reform.|$|E

2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1871, Richard Simpson {{proposed}} that some {{additions to the}} play had been written by Shakespeare, {{and a year later}} James Spedding, editor of the works of Sir Francis Bacon, while rejecting some of Simpson's suggestions, supported the attribution to Shakespeare of the passage credited to Hand D. In 1916, the paleographer Sir Edward Maunde Thompson published a minute analysis of the handwriting of the addition and judged it to be Shakespeare's. The case was strengthened with the publication of Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More (1923) by five noted scholars who analysed the play from multiple perspectives, all of which led to the same affirmative conclusion. A second significant gathering of scholars to consider Sir Thomas More grew out of a seminar that was held during the meeting of the Shakespeare Association of America at Ashland, Oregon in 1983. [...] It resulted in a second book of essays, eight by eight different authors, that was published as Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; Essays on the Play and its Shakespearean Interest. [...] It is a comprehensive study of the manuscript, and states that it appears more likely <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> Shakespeare did indeed contribute to the revision of this play. This would make it the only surviving manuscript text written by Shakespeare. Although some dissenters remain, the attribution has been generally accepted since the mid-20th century and most authoritative editions of Shakespeare's works, including The Oxford Shakespeare, include the play. It was performed with Shakespeare's name included amongst the authors by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>that</b> my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
