40|$|This {{study was}} set to {{investigate}} whether tutors in public <b>Teacher</b> <b>Colleges</b> are attracted to pursue postgraduate programmes offered through Open and Distance Learning specifically, at The Open University of Tanzania. The study also aimed at suggesting viable strategies that could attract more <b>teacher</b> <b>college</b> tutors in public <b>teacher</b> <b>colleges</b> to pursue post graduate programmes offered through ODL particularly, at OUT. The study was mainly qualitative in nature although some aspects of descriptive quantitative measures were employed. The data were collected through interviews and questionnaires. The findings revealed {{that the majority of}} <b>teacher</b> <b>college</b> tutors in public <b>Teacher</b> <b>Colleges</b> were not aware of the existence of OUT despite the university’s advertisements. The study found that {{there were a number of}} reasons that hindered the few <b>teacher</b> <b>college</b> tutors who were aware of the institution from pursuing postgraduate programmes offered through ODL especially at OUT. The reasons were categorized into those related to The Open University of Tanzania, college tutors’ employer and the tutors themselves. The study concluded that to a large extent OUT has played its role in advertising and publicizing the university through different media. However, it is evident through the study that much time was taken to complete postgraduate programmes studied by postgraduate students because of misplacement and loss of tests, assignments and examinations results, delay to give feed back for the marked tests, assignments and examinations, lack of study materials, and lack financial support from MoEVT. These reasons contributed in hindering tutors in public <b>Teacher</b> <b>Colleges</b> from pursuing postgraduate programmes at OUT. The researcher recommends that there is a need for OUT and MoEVT to address the challenges that distract <b>teacher</b> <b>college</b> tutors from pursuing post graduate programmes at OUT...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this study, conducted in Kabul province, {{is to find out}} important differences and similarities between public and private <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> that are operating in 2014 and to find out implications such variations might have for quality of teacher education. Secondary objectives of this study are: a) to explore possible associations between demographic and socio-economic characteristics of student-teachers and the type of <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> and b) to explore possible association between motivations behind studying in <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> and the type of <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges.</b> This study has targeted directors, lecturers and students from the <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges.</b> Questionnaires were prepared including items concerning demographic and socio-economic information and thereafter distributed to all three groups. Furthermore, the participants responded about the motivations for students and teachers to enroll in the <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges.</b> The study will also investigate if eventual differences existed in the enrolment procedures of the students and the recruitment process of the teachers between public and private <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges.</b> Based on Ministry of Education’s policy implementation this study found more similarities than differences between public and private <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges.</b> Differences included enrolment of students through advertisement by the private <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> while public <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> enrolled students through the university-admission test called kankor. The recruitment process of teachers’ was the same, at both public and Private <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> –in which recruited teachers should have minimum 75 % average marks at university. The main motives behind teachers’ teaching at public and private <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> were either close distance to their houses or similar cultural environment at <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges.</b> Likewise, many students at Private <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> were enrolled because of high quality of education. Meanwhile Public <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges,</b> students argued that the study facilities in Public <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges</b> are better, thus they want to continue education at Public <b>Teacher</b> Training <b>Colleges.</b> TEM...|$|R
