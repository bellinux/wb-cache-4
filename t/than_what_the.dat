5|$|Beckett {{engaged in}} {{protracted}} {{negotiations with the}} Marlins, during which he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College, but he eventually signed on August 28, 1999 to a four-year $7 million contract that included a $3.625 million signing bonus. His signing bonus was larger <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Marlins were paying everyone on the Major League roster, except pitcher Alex Fernandez.|$|E
5|$|No Code is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on August 27, 1996 through Epic Records. Following a troubled tour for its previous album, Vitalogy (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of garage rock and worldbeat.|$|E
5|$|Several older star {{players who}} were left unprotected, {{including}} Danny Tartabull, Jack Morris, and Shawon Dunston, were not selected due to their high salaries and advanced age. Based {{on the results of}} the expansion draft, the Marlins were projected to have a higher payroll in 1993 than the Rockies. The Rockies' payroll appeared to be $4 million, less <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Marlins would pay Bryan Harvey.|$|E

5|$|No Code sold 366,500copies in {{its first}} week of release, topping the Billboard 200, but falling short of analysts' {{predictions}} of at least 535,000 copies. This was significantly less <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> band's previous two albums sold in their respective first weeks of release. It was, however, the seventh biggest-selling debut of what was a slow year for the industry. It stayed at number one for two weeks, and was Pearl Jam's last album to debut at {{number one on the}} album chart until Backspacer was released in 2009. No Code was the band's first album to not reach multi-platinum status, being certified platinum by the RIAA, and, as of 2013, has sold 1.75 millioncopies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|The Jets' {{organizational}} {{philosophy at}} the time was to allow their European draft picks to develop in their native countries, but by 1991, the franchise was working to bring him to Winnipeg. As Selänne had not yet signed a contract when he chose to play in North America for the 1992–93 season, he was considered a restricted free agent. The Calgary Flames signed him to an offer sheet on a three-year contract worth $2.7 million, $1.5 million higher <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Jets had been offering. Though concerned about paying such a high salary, Winnipeg exercised its right to match the offer. Selänne made his NHL debut on October 6, 1992, and recorded two assists in a 4–1 Jets victory over the Detroit Red Wings. He scored his first career NHL goal two nights later against goaltender Jeff Hackett of the San Jose Sharks.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} a primary {{theme of the}} film score for The Boy with Green Hair (1948), for which the {{original}} version was used. The producers of the film reportedly paid $10,000 to ahbez for using the song, which was cumulatively more <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> author of the story, Betsy Beaton, was paid. A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing (1990). The tune and lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart (1993), for which Cole's version was used during the closing credits, while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film. The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast.|$|E

5|$|Thirteen {{animated}} theatrical films {{based on}} the One Piece series have been released in Japan. The films are typically released in March {{in accordance with the}} spring vacation of Japanese schools. The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the merger}} {{of the city and}} county systems, {{spending}} per-pupil differed greatly between the city and county schools. The City of Salisbury supplemented the spending more than the County of Rowan did.

25|$|The {{growth of}} the cotton, {{turpentine}} and lumber industries {{in the area of}} Singletary Lake State Park eventually was greater <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> soil could support.

Farmers were no longer able to produce sustainable crops and many were forced to leave their farms.|$|E

Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.|$|E

25|$|Every nobleman {{needed a}} well-suited {{place to live}} in the capital Stockholm. Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie's father, Jacob, built a grand palace close to the royal palace.

25|$|In 2000, a {{wind farm}} of 17 {{turbines}} was erected {{at the western}} cape. It has a nominal power capacity of 10.2 MW energy, and produces 30 GWh of electricity every year. This is much more <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> island needs, and the excess is transferred to mainland Anatolia through an underground and partly undersea cable. Overhead cables and pylons were avoided for esthetic reasons, preserving the scenic view. The land has an average wind speed of 6.4m/s and a mean energy density of 324W/mat its meteorological station. This indicates significant wind energy generation potential.|$|E

According to the report, Castro is actually suffering from intestinal cancer {{and will be}} unable to resume control of the Cuban state. The Brazilian government quickly denied that the report was accurate. Folhas editors responded to the government's denials by saying their sources were aides to the president.|$|E
