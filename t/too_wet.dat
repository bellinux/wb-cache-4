5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying petioles of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative humidity is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom primordia that are <b>too</b> <b>wet</b> become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause the caps to warp and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} eastern and southern Africa. Its range includes Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Angola. It is no longer found in Malawi but has been successfully reintroduced into Namibia. Blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas, thriving {{in areas that are}} neither <b>too</b> <b>wet</b> nor too dry. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains. In East Africa, the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game species, both in population and biomass. It is a notable feature of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and the Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was <b>too</b> <b>wet.</b> Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily on}} the short grasses. It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations, the animals being fast runners and extremely wary. The mating season begins {{at the end of}} the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother for eight months, after which time it joins a juvenile herd. Blue wildebeest are found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither <b>too</b> <b>wet</b> nor too arid. Three African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth.|$|E
25|$|Flies, {{other insects}} or rodents may {{appear in the}} feces vault, usually because it has become <b>too</b> <b>wet.</b> User {{education}} on correct use of the UDDT, trapping rodents and checking the ventilation system are actions to be taken.|$|E

25|$|The slumped {{concrete}} takes various {{shapes and}} according to the profile of slumped concrete, the slump is termed as true slump, shear slump or collapse slump.

25|$|When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, {{it should}} have little smell if any smell is present, it is earthy. Worms require gaseous oxygen. Oxygen can be {{provided}} by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or <b>too</b> <b>wet.</b> If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of ammonia.|$|E
25|$|If {{this image}} were {{transferred}} directly to paper, {{it would create}} a mirror-type image and the paper would become <b>too</b> <b>wet.</b> Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber blanket, which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or offset to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as offset lithography or offset printing.|$|E
25|$|Only a true slump is of any {{use in the}} test. A {{collapse}} slump {{will generally}} mean that the mix is <b>too</b> <b>wet</b> or {{that it is a}} high workability mix, for which the slump test is not appropriate. Very dry mixes having slump 0 – 25mm are typically used in road making, low workability mixes having slump 10 – 40mm are typically used for foundations with light reinforcement, medium workability mixes with slump 50 – 90mm, are typically used for normal reinforced concrete placed with vibration, high workability concrete with slump > 100mm is typically used where reinforcing has tight spacing, and/or the concrete has to flow a great distance.|$|E

25|$|In 1935 Gover's {{progress}} was stalled by him shortening his run to conserve his energy, but when allowed his full run in 1936 Gover went from strength to strength.

He played for England against India at Old Trafford but the wicket was so good that even his energetic delivery could produce no venom. The following year (1937) Gover did equally well, again taking 201 wickets. He remains the only fast bowler to take that many wickets in a season, since Tom Richardson in 1897.|$|E
25|$|Derbyshire {{played host to}} a team of South Africans in 1901, as {{the young}} Test nation played a series of eleven warm-up matches against English county sides prior to a Test series against the English cricket team. However, a {{publicity}} boost such as this only served to panic an ever-spiralling Derbyshire team into once again finishing in bottom place in the table. The following year, 1902, was slightly more encouraging for Derbyshire, as, boosted {{by the appearance of}} long-time Warwickshire player Thomas Forrester, after three years out of the game, Derbyshire finished in their highest position since the beginning of Bestwick's career, finishing the season in tenth place. Bestwick bowled very well in a summer when pitches were almost always <b>too</b> <b>wet</b> to suit a bowler of his pace, and was probably the second best fast bowler in county cricket after William Lockwood.|$|E

500|$|The clearcutting and {{repeated}} fires changed all of this. New growth was often composed of different plants and trees than {{had originally been}} there. Near Beaver Run in Quehanna there are wetlands that were originally hemlock forest. Hemlocks transpire large amounts of water and once they were gone the soil was <b>too</b> <b>wet</b> to support most trees; the bracken and ferns that replaced the hemlocks altered the soil qualities to discourage trees as well. Within the Quehanna Wild Area [...] are wetlands. Fires and erosion removed nutrients from the soil, and in some areas the soil was so poor in nutrients that only white birch, a pioneer species, would grow there.

500|$|Many other diverse {{forms of}} parental care {{are seen in}} frogs. The tiny male Colostethus subpunctatus stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, he {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself {{in the water and}} one or more tadpoles drop off. He then moves on to another pool. The male common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs. He keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond, and prevents them from getting <b>too</b> <b>wet</b> in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters. After three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. The foam is made from proteins and lectins, and seems to have antimicrobial properties. Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. The eggs are laid in the centre, followed by [...] alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.|$|E

50|$|You can {{distinguish}} a traditional letterpress printer from a digital printer by its debossed lettering.
