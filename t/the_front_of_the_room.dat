60|$|Rollo {{looked about}} upon the pier a few minutes, {{and then went}} into the hotel. He passed through a spacious hall, and then through a passage way, from which he could look into a large room, the sides of which were formed of glass, so {{that the people who}} were in the room could see out all around them. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> looked out upon the pier, the back side upon the passage way. A third side was toward the vestibule, and the fourth toward the coffee room. There were shelves around this room, within, and tables, and desks, and people going to and fro there. In fact, it seemed to be the office of the hotel.|$|E

A row of low, stone-ribbed windows pierced <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Looking out he saw the trim garden lying in the warm evening light. Immediately beneath the windows ran a broad graveled terrace, which was evidently raked smooth every day, and a row of urns in which hyacinths bloomed stood upon its pillared wall. From {{the middle of the}} terrace a wide stairway led down to the wonderful velvet lawn, which was dotted with clumps of cupressus with golden gleams in it, and beyond the lawn clipped yews rose smooth and solid as a rampart of stone.|$|E
