The increased viral load and changing subsets of lytic or latent viral proteins observed in selected populations with SLE have indicated that common viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B 19, cytomegalovirus, retroviruses and <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> <b>viruses,</b> might be triggers for this disease. Alternatively, some infectious agents might exert a protective effect from autoimmunity. Existing achievements have not been fully investigated and clarified.

40|$|Background: The risk of {{infection}} by <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> <b>viruses</b> has been reduced remarkably. However, a zero-risk blood supply is still desirable. The screening for antibody to HBc (anti-HBc) has been shown as an alternative test {{for the detection of}} HBV infection. Objective: The main aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate HBV infection markers and the potential value of anti-HBc testing of blood donors to detect HBV infection. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 545 blood samples were collected and tested for HbsAg using ELISA method. Then all HBsAg negative samples were tested for anti-HBc by the same method. To detect HBV infection, all HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive samples were tested by PCR for HBV DNA. Results: All blood samples were HBsAg negative of which, 43 (8 %) were anti-HBc positive. From those which were positive for anti-HBc, five samples were also positive for HBV DNA. Conclusion: Occult HBV infection is a clinical form of HBV infection in which HBsAg is not expressed by HBV and blood samples cannot be screened by ELISA method, therefore more sensitive techniques are needed.

It initiates many economic and health problems in management modalities and leads to increasing mortality rates. Worldwide, trials have attempted to discover specific early markers for detection and prediction of the disease, hoping to set a more precise strategy for liver cancer prevention. Unfortunately, many economic, cultural and disciplinary levels contribute to confounding preventive strategies. Many risk factors contribute to predisposition to HCC, which can present individually or simultaneously. Previous articles discussed many risk factors for hepatocellular carcinogenesis; however, most of them didn't consider collectively the most recent data relating to causes.

Therefore one should develop an individual approach for every case. In this context the most important subjects are an optimal coordination and if required an appropriate combination of the discussed methods. Algorithms which preoperatively allow approximate calculation of expected transfusion need may be a meaningful tool to facilitate blood conservation planning.

We distributed blinded panels to compare the analytical performance of blood screening relative to diagnostic NAT assays. A 25 -member, coded panel (11 half-log dilutions of a 2013 French Polynesia ZIKV isolate and 2015 Brazilian donor plasma implicated in transfusion transmission, and 3 negative controls) was sent to 11 laboratories that performed 17 assays with 2 to 12 replicates per panel member. Results were analyzed for the percentage reactivity at each dilution and by probit analysis to estimate the 50 % and 95 % limits of detection (LOD 50 and LOD 95, respectively). Donor-screening NAT assays that process approximately 500 µL of plasma into amplification reactions were comparable in sensitivity (LOD 50 and LOD 95, 2. 5 and 15 - 18 copies/mL) and were approximately 10 -fold to 100 -fold more sensitive than research laboratory-developed and diagnostic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests that process from 10 to 30 µL of plasma per amplification.

40|$|Introduction: In {{recent years}} with {{introduction}} of better screening tests, {{the risk of}} infection with <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> <b>viruses</b> has been reduced remarkably, although obtaining a zero-risk blood supply still remains international blood transfusion services goal. The routine test for detection of HBV infected blood samples is examination of HBsAg with ELISA method but in occult HBV infection, HBsAg is not detectable by ELISA. Therefore, a more sensitive or complementary test is needed. Some international blood transfusion services have introduced anti-HBc screening as a surrogate test {{for the presence of}} HBV infection. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Isfahanian blood donors and the potential value of anti-HBc testing of donors as a screening test to detect occult HBV infection. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 545 blood units were collected (from Isfahan blood center) and tested by HBsAg ELISA kit from April to June 2004 and then all HBsAg negative samples were tested by anti-HBc ELISA kit. To detect occult HBV infection, all HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive samples were tested by PCR method. Results: All samples were negative for HBsAg while 43 blood units were anti-HBc positive (8 %). These HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive blood units were tested for HBV DNA of which five units (% 11. 6) were HBV DNA positive. Conclusion: Occult HBV infection is a clinical form of HBV infection that cannot be detected by usual method (ELISA) for HBsAg and therefore more sensitive techniques are needed for detection of HBV infection. PCR is a sensitive technique that detects HBV DNA even in a trace mounts. Our results identified that more sensitive and complementary tests such as, PCR and anti-HBc, are essential and helpful to ensure safety of blood units...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{infection}} with <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> <b>viruses</b> has been reduced remarkably. However, a zero-risk blood supply remains a popular goal. Some authorities have introduced the screening for antibody to HBc (anti-HBc) as a surrogate test {{for the presence of}} several infectious agents. A 3 -year prospective study was conducted in the Epirus region of Greece to determine the prevalence of several blood-borne viruses. One component of the study was the prevalence of HBV infection markers and the potential value of anti-HBc testing of donors in this area. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, some 6696 donors were investigated for the presence of HBV infection markers by standard EIAs. Every sample that tested HBsAg-negative but anti-HBc-reactive alone or in combination with either or both antibodies to HBV e antigen (anti-HBe) and low-titered antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs < 20 mIU/mL) was further investigated for the presence of HBV DNA by a combination of PGR and DNA EIA. RESULTS: Of these 6696 donors, 15. 8 percent tested positive for at least one serologic marker of HBV infection (HBsAg prevalence, 0. 85 %). Anti-HBc reactivity alone or in combination with either or both anti-HBe and low-titered anti-HBs was found in 282 donors (4. 2 %). None tested HBV-DNA positive. No transfusion-associated HBV infections were recorded in the recipients of the above 282 blood units. CONCLUSION: A moderate prevalence of HBV infection markers was found, However, taking into account previous studies from this region, it appears that the HBsAg prevalence has declined. in addition, the present study cannot recommend the introduction of anti-HBe screening as a surrogate marker of occult HBV infection. The adoption of this exclusion criterion in this region would result in unacceptably high rejection rates among otherwise healthy donors. The absence of any case of transfusion-associated HBV infection after the transfusion of ail HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive units appears to provide further support for the negative HBV DNA results. Before a consideration of screening donors, efforts must be focused on reducing the number of false-positive anti-HBe results...|$|R

Moreover, recent studies conducted in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region indicate that HEV is highly endemic.

The safety improvements since then have been tremendous. From {{a level of}} a few infections per 1000 donations, the risk today, depending on the screening algorithm and additional measurements performed, has decreased to around 1 : 500, 000 to 1 : 1, 000, 000, an improvement greater than 1000 -fold compared to 50 years ago. This enormous gain in safety has been achieved through many factors, including development of increasingly more sensitive Hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg) assays; the adoption in some countries of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) screening; an improved donor selection procedure; HBV vaccination programs; and finally the introduction of HBV nucleic acid testing (NAT). Because {{there is a tendency}} in transfusion medicine to add one safety measure on top of another to approach the ultimate goal of zero risks, costs become increasingly a matter of debate. It is obvious that any new measure in addition to existing methods or measures will have very poor cost effectiveness. Therefore each country needs to perform its own calculation based on the country&# 39;s own epidemiology, resources, political and public awareness of the risks, in order to choose the correct and most cost-efficient measures. Ideally, each country would make decisions regarding implementation of additional blood safety measures in the context of both the perceived benefit and the allocation of overall health care resources.

40|$|Background: The risk of {{infection}} with <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> <b>viruses</b> has been reduced remarkably. A zero-risk blood supply, however, remains a popular goal. A 3 -year prospective donor {{study was conducted in}} the Epirus region of Greece to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Herein, we report the prevalence of HIV, HTLV, and HCV infection markers in this area. Methodology: Between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1997, 6696 donors were investigated for the presence of anti-HIV, anti-HTLV, and anti-HCV antibodies using standard enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Every sample with anti-HCV reactivity by third-generation EIA was further investigated using a third-generation recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 3. 0) and HCV-RNA by a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA EIA. Results: None of the donors tested positive for anti-HIV or anti-HTLV antibodies. In contrast, anti-HCV was detected in 41 donors (0. 61 %). Using a RIBA 3. 0 test, eight donors tested positive and eight had indeterminate results, while 25 tested negative. Seven of the eight donors with both EIA and RIBA 3. 0 reactivity had increased levels of aminotransferases and detectable serum HCV-RNA. The remaining 34 donors had repeatedly normal aminotransferases and three times negative HCV-RNA. Liver biopsy was performed in anti-HCV/HCV-RNA-positive donors (7 / 41). The lesions were compatible with chronic hepatitis C in all of them. Conclusion: A zero prevalence of HIV and HTLV infection markers was found. Although the number of annual donations in this study was relatively low, the negative data for HIV and HTLV clearly indicate that rates of these infections are low in our region and that infected donors will be seen infrequently. HCV infection in blood donors remains very low in our region and is similar to the data reported in other industrialized countries. In fact, the prevalence of definite HCV infection seems to be very low (7 / 6696; 0. 1 %). However, a significant proportion of anti-HCV-reactive donors by third-generation EIA (33 / 41) had indeterminate or negative results by the RIBA 3. 0. The latter donors were repeatedly negative for HCV-RNA. This finding may indicate that some donors tested false-positive for anti-HCV, although the possibility of true HCV infection contracted in the distant past cannot be excluded. In our opinion, close attention to mandatory principles of transfusion medicine, along with the screening of plasma donors using nucleic acid amplification technology, are the only methods that can further ensure the safety of our blood supply. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

Dengue fever is an endemic disease in Saudi Arabia, particularly in its Western region. The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the seroprevalence of asymptomatic DENV infection and its antibodies among eligible Saudi blood donors. Methods: Serum samples from 910 healthy/eligible adult male Saudi blood donors, who reside in Holy Makkah City of Saudi Arabia, were collected between March 2015 and August 2016 and screened for the detection of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS 1) antigen and anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Panbio, Brisbane, QLD, Australia). Results: Among the tested donors, 48 (5. 3 %) were seropositive for DENV-NS 1 antigen, whereas 50 (5. 5 %) and 354 (38. 9 %) were seropositive for anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. Seropositivity for DENV-NS 1 antigen and/or anti-DENV IgM antibody among the tested donors reflects their ongoing asymptomatic viremic infectious stage with DENV during their donation time, whereas high prevalence of anti-DENV IgG seropositivity reflects the high endemicity of dengue disease in this region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: These results show high prevalence of asymptomatic DENV infection and its antibodies among Saudi blood donors, raising the importance of establishing blood screening for dengue disease at different blood donation services and units in Saudi Arabia to improve the guarantee of blood transfusions and to control DENV dissemination...|$|R

Because {{of the potential}} for Zika virus to be transmitted through transfusion of blood components, and because a high percentage of persons infected with Zika virus are asymptomatic (2), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that blood collections cease in areas of the United States affected by active vector-borne transmission of Zika virus until laboratory screening of blood donations or pathogen reduction technology (PRT) * for treatment of blood components can be implemented (3). To inform efforts to maintain the safety and availability of the blood supply in Puerto Rico, CDC, in collaboration with the Puerto Rico Department of Health, conducted a rapid assessment of blood collection and use on the island. A total of 139, 369 allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) units, 22 ̆ 0 ac 0 45, 243 platelet units, and 56, 466 plasma units were collected in or imported to Puerto Rico during 2015, and 135, 966 allogeneic RBC units, 13, 526 therapeutic platelet units, 27 and 25, 775 plasma units were transfused. Because {{of the potential for}} local Zika virus transmission in areas with a competent mosquito vector (4), other areas of the United States should develop plans to ensure local blood safety and adequacy.

These interventions were improved donor questionnaires, best-practice skin disinfection, and diversion of first blood volume. These interventions have reduced the number of bacteria present in the platelet concentrates. In combination with screening for bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates with a culture method, the degree of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection has been reduced significantly. Due to the very low initial bacteria counts upon collection of the products, the need for improved sensitivity of early screenings tests or highly selective point-of-issue tests remains. The latter should be rapid and easy to perform. An alternative approach might be the implementation of pathogen-inactivation methods for cellular blood products {{to reduce the amount of}} pathogens.

It is obvious that any new measure in addition to existing methods or measures will have very poor cost effectiveness. Therefore each country needs to perform its own calculation based on the country’s own epidemiology, resources, political and public awareness of the risks, in order to choose the correct and most cost-efficient measures. Ideally, each country would make decisions regarding implementation of additional blood safety measures in the context of both the perceived benefit and the allocation of overall health care resources...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{bacterial}} culture of platelets, transfusion-associated bacteremia/sepsis (TABS) may occur with a frequency of approximately 1 / 60, 000 platelet transfusions, while an emerging transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI) could reproduce {{the epidemic of}} <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> human immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> (HIV) in the future. As platelet pathogen-reduction (PR) systems licensed in Europe may eventually become licensed in the U. S., three alternative strategies for reducing the residual risks of TTIs and TABS may become available in the U. S. in the future: (1) transfusion of (already-available) non–pathogen-reduced single-donor (as opposed to pooled whole-blood-derived [PWBD]) platelets, (2) transfusion of pathogen-reduced single-donor platelets, or (3) transfusion of pathogen-reduced PWBD platelets (if trials of this component are conducted in the U. S. in the future). PR of platelets will {{increase the risk of}} mild and moderate (albeit perhaps not severe) bleeding complications and it cannot protect from all pathogens. Compared to PWBD platelets, single-donor platelets can reduce, by at least twofold, the risk of all known and emerging TTIs, as well as the risk of TABS, without incurring any risk. The fewer donor exposures secured by the use of single-donor platelets – especially if combined with collection of red blood cells and/or plasma from the same donation for transfusion to the same recipient through the use of multicomponent apheresis – may also reduce the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury. To choose between pathogen-reduced and non–pathogen-reduced single-donor platelets, the increased risks of bleeding complications as well as other possible adverse events secondary to PR need to be quantified precisely and weighed against the competing risks of TABS and emerging TTIs...|$|R
40|$|The risk of <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> {{hepatitis}} C <b>virus</b> (HCV) infection was {{the greatest}} in people with hae-mophilia (PWH) before identification and testing for this virus became available in 1987. After introduction of HCV screening and virucidal measures post 1987, this risk significantly reduced in the developed coun-tries (1. 8 %). 1 However, in resource poor settings, the risk still remained high. The HCV seroprevalence rate among PWH in Brazil was as high at 44 %, 2 with that in Pakistan higher at 56 %. 3 In the haemophilia population, diagnosis of HCV appears to be earlier (29 - 31 years), 4 compared to oth-er non-hemophilia patient populations (52 years). 5 This difference {{could be due to}} a number of reasons, chronicity of hemophilia and close clinical follow of PWH by dedicated teams being some of the contrib-uting factors. Knowledge on HCV genotypes and vi-ral loads are important in making treatment decisions as well as predicting response to treatment. From a public health perspective, knowledge of the genotype frequencies and their changes can provide important epidemiological information for screening and pre-ventative public programs. 6 HCV genotyping tests have transformed over the years from in-house se-quencing to commercialised line probe assays (LiPA) and as well as real-time PCR analyses. However, the method of choice should be sensitive enough to detect all HCV genotypes including mixed genotype infec-tions. Although earlier reports seem to indicate that mixed genotype infections were rare, 7 recent data indicate that the diagnosis of mixed genotypes has been increasing as indicated by Alavian et al. ...|$|R
40|$|On June 17, 2016, {{this report}} was posted online as an MMWR Early Release. Transfusion-transmitted infections have been {{documented}} for several arboviruses, including West Nile and dengue viruses (1). Zika virus, a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that {{has been identified as}} a cause of congenital microcephaly and other serious brain defects (2), became recognized as a potential threat to blood safety after reports from a 201322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2014 outbreak in French Polynesia. Blood safety concerns were based on very high infection incidence in the population at large during epidemics, the high percentage of persons with asymptomatic infection, the high proportion of blood donations with evidence of Zika virus nucleic acid upon retrospective testing, and an estimated 722 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 10 -day period of viremia (3). At least one instance of transfusion transmission of Zika virus has been documented in Brazil after the virus emerged there, likely in 2014 (4). Rapid epidemic spread has followed to other areas of the Americas, including Puerto Rico. In February 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations for donor screening, donor deferral, and product management to reduce the risk for <b>transfusion-transmitted</b> Zika <b>virus</b> in the United States and its territories (5). In addition to behavioral- and health-risk questionnaires for blood donors in all areas, FDA recommends deferrals for donors in unaffected areas who recently lived in or visited an area with active mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus. For establishments collecting blood in areas with active, local mosquito-borne transmission, such as Puerto Rico and other U. S. territories, the recommendations include discontinuing local blood collections and importing blood units from unaffected areas of the continental United States unless one of the following is implemented: 1) Zika virus screening of locally collected blood donations or 2) treatment of locally collected units with pathogen-reduction technology (FDA-approved only for plasma and apheresis platelets). In Puerto Rico, interventions initially were limited to importation of blood units from unaffected U. S. areas and to treatment of plasma and apheresis platelets with pathogen-reduction technology; no Zika virus screening test was available. On April 3, 2016, Zika virus screening of locally collected blood donations was implemented using a newly developed nucleic acid test (NAT) (cobas Zika, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Pleasanton, California) authorized by FDA under an investigational new drug application (IND) (6). As part of the IND, plasma samples from blood donors are screened individually, and specimens with reactive results are subjected to additional testing including an alternate NAT and immunoglobulin M serology. A blood donation with an initial reactive result by NAT is regarded as a presumptive viremic donor, indicating an infected donor, and is interdicted and removed from the blood supply. During April 322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cJune 11, 2016, a total of 68 (0. 5...|$|R
