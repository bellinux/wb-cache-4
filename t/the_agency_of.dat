5|$|In {{the realm}} of {{structural}} engineering and technical Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang Lü (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712–756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>of</b> Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).|$|E
5|$|Many crash {{survivors}} suffered long recoveries {{from the}} physical and psychological traumas they endured. A month after the crash, an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest {{the handling of the}} flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and the relatives of those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200million in damages to the victims.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how net income, non－performing loans, and operational fixed－assets of main bank {{are associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> costs <b>of</b> borrowing firms. Results {{of this study indicate}} that the association between non－performing loans and <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> costs <b>of</b> borrowing firms is statistically positive and the association between operational fixed－assets and <b>agency</b> costs <b>of</b> borrowing firms is statistically negative. This implies that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets of main bank are significantly associated with <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> costs <b>of</b> borrowing firms. Specifically, non－performing loans increase <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> costs <b>of</b> borrowing firms, whereas operational－fixed assets decrease <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> costs <b>of</b> borrowing firms. These results suggest that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets are significantly associated with not only banks themselves but also <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> costs <b>of</b> borrowing firms. This study contributes to banking literatures that have examined the relationship between main banks and borrowing firmsclose...|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>of</b> Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Northern England in the 11th-century was {{a region}} quite {{distinct}} {{from the rest of}} the country. The former kingdom of Northumbria stretched from the Humber and Mersey estuaries, northward to the Firth of Forth, where, passing the western Kingdom of Strathclyde, it met the Kingdom of Alba (Scotland). Northumbria had been united with the West Saxon English kingdom only in the 950s, by King Eadred, and subsequent control was exerted through <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> at least two ealdormen, one to the north and one to the south of the River Tees. The former is associated with the stronghold of Bamburgh, while the latter is associated with the great Roman city of York. It was a politically fragmented region. The western part, from Lancashire to Cumberland, was heavily settled by Norse-Gaels, while in the rest of Northumbria English and Anglo-Scandinavian regional magnates—thegns, holds and high-reeves—exercised a considerable degree of independence from the ealdormen. One such example was the magnate Thurbrand, a hold in Yorkshire, probably based in Holderness, whose family were frequently at odds with the ruling earls at Bamburgh.|$|E
5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters {{make it clear that}} by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to help make peace. In the end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E
