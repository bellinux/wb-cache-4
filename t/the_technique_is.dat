5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> flawless, {{it does have}} several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, or subjected to certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, as shown by Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's body part is absent.|$|E
5|$|Resonant {{oscillations}} of spherical and hemispherical liquid drop: <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} measuring the resonant frequency of spherical and hemispherical pendant droplets driven in oscillations by a modulated electric field. The surface tension and viscosity can be evaluated from the obtained resonant curves.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> {{refined and}} <b>the</b> {{qualitative}} and quantitative aspects of <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>were</b> later described by several researchers in the 70s and 80s: Bereiter-Hahn and his colleagues correlated <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> with electron microscopy, showing that different mammalian cell lines adhere to the glass substrate in specific focal adhesion sites.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> used in Lettrist {{painting}} and cinema, in which letters were drawn {{directly onto the}} film. As the Lettrists became more experimental {{in their use of}} media, <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> applied more to everyday life in critiquing urbanism and architecture in the Lettrist field of psychogeography.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> found {{around the}} world, from the Nile Delta to Japan, where bamboo {{was used to}} make the wattle.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} is {{a collection}} of techniques used to analyse biological markers in the genome and proteomethe individual's genetic code and how their cells express their genes as proteinsby applying molecular biology to medical testing. <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> used to diagnose and monitor disease, detect risk, and decide which therapies will work best for individual patients.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Home Movies co-creator Brendon Small, and was the final episode of the series' {{production}} run. The episode was the fifty-second of the series, a number that allows for an even distribution of reruns of the series; Small noted that <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> normally used on animated children's shows, though Home Movies is actually created for an adult audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{paper is}} {{operated}} by a staff of approximately 50 paid and unpaid students, {{as well as two}} permanent, paid, non-student staff members. As Georgia Tech has no journalism school, the Technique welcomes all students within the Institute to contribute to its content. <b>The</b> <b>Technique</b> <b>is</b> funded primarily by advertisements, {{and to a lesser extent}} by Tech's Student Government Association.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E
40|$|Spot {{noise and}} line {{integral}} convolution (LIC) are two texture synthesis techniques for vector field visualization. In this paper <b>the</b> two <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> compared. Continuous directional convolution {{is used as}} a common basis for comparing <b>the</b> <b>techniques.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> based on <b>the</b> same mathematical concept.

5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> extremely useful in current laboratory practice {{because it provides}} a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides of the desired sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E
5|$|Supportive {{therapy and}} diaphragmatic {{breathing}} has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% {{in one study}} of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting {{in the past have}} a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. <b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful. Most infants grow out of the disorder within a year or with aversive training.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{difficult}} to understand, {{even for the}} supervisors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} used {{to create}} the PC sidescroller Commander Keen.|$|R
50|$|The {{experience}} of Knowledge {{is described by}} practitioners as internal and highly individual. <b>The</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> to be practised privately, and have no related social structure or hierarchy. According to students, there is no liturgy or social obligation involved. They also say that <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> universally applicable and their practice has no impact on, or relationship to, a student's gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status, religion,or national origin.|$|R
