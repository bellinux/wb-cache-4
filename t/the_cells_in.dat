5|$|Like {{those of}} cnidarians, (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), ctenophores' bodies {{consist of a}} {{relatively}} thick, jelly-like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia, layers of cells bound by inter-cell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete. The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one, and some of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> the upper layer have several cilia per cell.|$|E

5|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} {{to a number of}} Amanita species. It can be distinguished from A.praegraveolens microscopically by the absence of clamp connections between <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> S.thiersii. Both S.thiersii and A.aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the whole fruit body is yellower. A.silvifuga is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It can be distinguished by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E

5|$|Sutner {{defines a}} {{directed}} graph (a type of de Bruijn graph) {{in which each}} vertex represents a pair of assignments of states for <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> a contiguous sequence of cells. The length of this sequence is chosen to be one less than the neighborhood size of the automaton. An edge in Sutner's graph represents a pair of sequences of cells that overlap {{in all but one}} cell, so that the union of the sequences is a full neighborhood in the cellular automaton. Each such edge is directed from the overlapping subsequence on the left to the subsequence on the right. Edges are only included in the graph when they represent compatible state assignments on the overlapping parts of their cell sequences, and when the automaton rule (applied to the neighborhood determined by the potential edge) would give the same results for both assignments of states. By performing a linear-time strong connectivity analysis of this graph, it is possible to determine which of its vertices belong to cycles. The transition rule is non-injective if and only if this graph contains a directed cycle in which at least one vertex has two differing state assignments.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{untested}} {{hypothesis that}} claims that referred itch uses the spinocervical tract pathway. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> this tract {{lie in the}} dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and its axons run in the ipsilateral and dorsolateral quadrant, {{which is consistent with}} observations that stimuli in the trigger points are ipsilateral to the sites of referred sensations. These axons project to the thalamus and midbrain, suggesting that the thalamus is involved in the phenomenon. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> this tract are also excited by mechanical stimuli, lending support that this pathway can explain the mechanism of referred itch. Central neuronal damage to this area – either direct or secondary to peripheral nerve damage – makes it an area of focal hyperexcitability or reduced inhibition.

25|$|An {{experimental}} {{study suggests that}} the pericyte death is caused by blood glucose persistently activating protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which {{through a series of}} intermediates inhibits signaling through platelet-derived growth factor receptors — signaling that supports cellular survival, proliferation, and growth.
