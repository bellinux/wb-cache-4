500|$|During Christmas 2001, while Debra Searle was {{competing}} in the Atlantic Rowing Race by making a solo transatlantic crossing from Tenerife to Barbados, her twin sister Hayley sent her a copy of What's So Amazing About Grace? {{as part of a}} Christmas package that was delivered at sea. Although she had belonged to a local church as a child, Debra had become irreligious by 2001. After reading Yancey's book while she was alone on the ocean that Christmas, she said, [...] "I felt like God was <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> protecting me". Reading the book brought about a change in her that eventually resulted in her becoming actively involved in Mutley Baptist Church, which is noted for its community engagement.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

According to Gutta, such controversies do not bother her {{as she had been}} taught to speak up for whats right and take a stand for herself and others too. [...] "My father (Kranti) told me at a young age to fight for what I believed in. I've never learnt to butter up people," [...] stated Jwala in an interview with Hindustan Times. [...] "Controversies don't bother me. I'm not the one who instigates them. But when your name gets dragged into it, you can't keep quiet," [...] she said. [...] She said she is targeted because she speaks her mind. S. M. Arif Jwala's coach said, [...] "This girl, she is <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> since she was 4 years old, from that age she is <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and one thing about her is that she is the laziest person as far as the training is concerned {{and as far as the}} court is concerned you keep her for the whole long day and she will be happy, otherwise her genes might be helping her out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maezumi was {{forthcoming}} in admitting {{his mistakes}} {{and did not}} justify his behaviors. These events caused much turmoil in his school, and many students left as a result. Some members who stayed described themselves as forced to see Maezumi on a more human level, even seeing this period as a breakthrough for them, no longer deluded into thinking a teacher could be beyond imperfection. Both Bays and Tetsugen Bernard Glassman founded their own sanghas at this time. When remembering Maezumi, author David Chadwick had this to say: [...] "I'd say he had an interesting mix of humility and arrogance. Mainly to me he'd seem arrogant at a distance, but close up he'd be right <b>there</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> not putting on any airs." ...|$|E

In a 2005 interview, Ghostface Killah explained [...] "We was in the car one day, driving around with the DAT machine with a microphone and we just started talking shit about how we're gonna do it this summer with the Clarks.
