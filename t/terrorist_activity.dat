They also protected Jewish and Arab settlements from sectarian violence. This was not without loss to the division and several members were killed and wounded during this time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} aims at {{understanding}} the perception towards <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> by Muddrassa students in Pakistan. <b>Terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> have influenced {{different groups of}} Pakistani society in a very harsh way. Pakistan {{is one of the}} biggest victims of <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> after the start of US lead war on terror. Fifteen case studies and three Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were sampled from Gujrat city, Pakistan for this study. The results showed that majority of the cases and participants perceive <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> negative for the national interest and interest of local people. Few respondents perceived <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> against specific places (cinema, CD shop, etc.) promoting vulgarity according to their point of view. It was noted that majority of the respondents were against the killing of humans for achieving any positive or negative objective. They also perceived <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> against government as a loss of common people, property and on the basis of religion against Islam and humanity. They perceived that there may be some external powers which are involved in <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> in Pakistan. It was suggested to tackle the issue by promoting respect to humanity, tolerance, upgrading security and acceptability...|$|R

25|$|The USA Patriot Act {{was passed}} seven {{weeks after the}} {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001. The purpose of the act was to give the government more power to act upon suspicion of <b>terrorist</b> <b>activity.</b> The new governmental powers granted by this act included a significant expansion of the conditions in which illegal immigrants could be deported based on suspicion of <b>terrorist</b> <b>activity.</b> The act gave the government the power to deport individuals based not only on plots or acts of terrorism, but on affiliations with certain organizations. The Secretary of State designated specific organizations foreign terrorist organizations before the USA Patriot Act was implemented. Organizations on this list were deemed dangerous because they were actively involved in <b>terrorist</b> <b>activity.</b> The Patriot Act created a type of organization called designated organizations. The Secretary of State and Attorney General were given the power to designate any organization that supported <b>terrorist</b> <b>activity</b> on any level. The act also allows for deportation based on involvement in undesignated organizations that were deemed suspicious.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{makes two}} {{contributions}} to the literature on terrorism: 1) It presents a model that explains the cyclical characteristics of terrorist attacks, and 2) It improves on the existing theoretical cyclical models since it takes explicitly into account terrorists motivations and decision-making. The model assumes that the government acts as leader and terrorists as followers. Terrorists maximize terrorist acts over time constrained by their budget constraint, which yields a time path for <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities.</b> Then the government maximizes national security by taking the time path of <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> and investments in enforcement as constraints. The model shows that permanent cyclical paths for enforcement, <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities,</b> <b>terrorist</b> capital and national security may arise as an optimal solution. ...|$|R
25|$|A British {{passport}} {{was issued}} in 2009, but in 2013 it was confiscated at Heathrow airport upon Begg's {{return from a}} trip to South Africa. The Home Office said that Begg had been assessed as having been involved in <b>terrorist</b> <b>activity,</b> due to a trip to Syria the previous year. Begg claimed that the real reason for the confiscation was his campaign to prove UK and US complicity in the use of torture and rendition of suspects, and that he had been stopped for questioning almost every time he had travelled, even when returning from an official speaking invitation at the European Parliament.|$|E

I would not have been there if there was any suggestion of <b>terrorist</b> <b>activity</b> or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} an effort to {{estimate}} the impact of <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> on the financial markets in Pakistan over the period of two years i. e. 2006 to 2008.

After collection of the primary data for the <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> on daily basis and the secondary data on the indicators of the three markets, by using the OLS model it attempts to quantify the impacts of various types of terrorists’ activities on financial markets. We have found during our analysis that the <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> adversely affect the financial markets under study but the significance varies for different markets. Along with <b>terrorist</b> <b>activities</b> many other stochastic activities are responsible for the adverse performance of financial markets which have not been taken into account. The study recommends the policy stance on institutional development regarding investment in the innovative security industry and providing rosier environment for investors by altering the money supply and interest rates. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{possibility}} of psychopathy {{has been associated}} with organized crime, economic crime and war crimes. Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and blame externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated <b>terrorist</b> <b>activity</b> requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism.|$|E
