50|$|Soviet negotiators {{had insisted}} that the troop {{transfer}} agreement (to Hanko) should not be published for parliamentary discussion or voting. This precedent {{made it easy for}} the Finnish government to keep a troop transfer agreement with the Germans secret until the first German troops arrived at the port of Vaasa on September 21. The arrival of German troops produced much relief to the insecurity of average Finns, and was largely approved. Most contrary voices opposed more the way the agreement was negotiated than the transfer itself, although the Finnish people knew only the barest details of the agreements with the Third Reich. The presence of German troops was seen as a deterrent for further Soviet threats and a counterbalance to the Soviet troop <b>transfer</b> <b>right.</b> The German troop transfer agreement was augmented November 21 allowing the transfer of wounded, and soldiers on leave, via Turku. Germans arrived and established quarters, depots, and bases along the rail lines from Vaasa and Oulu to Ylitornio and Rovaniemi, and from there along the roads via Karesuvanto and Kilpisjärvi or Ivalo and Petsamo to Skibotn and Kirkenes in northern Norway. Also roadworks for improving winter road (between Karesuvanto and Skibotn) and totally new road (from Ivalo to Karasjok) were discussed, and later financed, by Germans.|$|E

On Day 23 after the embryo <b>transfer,</b> <b>right</b> tubal pregnancy with a 0. 7 -cm gestational sac was found by ultrasound, and her serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 81, 388  mIU/mL.

A live fetus with a crown–rump length of 2. 0  cm was found in the cul-de-sac. Under the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy, she was admitted for sona-guided KCl and methotrexate injections. She received four units of packed red blood cells due to a drop in hemoglobin level from 12. 5  g/dL to 8. 6  g/dL. The patient recovered well, and the serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin declined to < 10  mIU/mL.

40|$|Abstract Background: More {{and more}} {{software}} development companies decide {{to share their}} workload between teams which are geographically distributed. One {{of the biggest challenges}} is to start up work when new team members are introduced at a distant site of a global cooperation. Usually existing development processes do not cover integrating distributed collaboration, hence {{there is a need to}} adjust them to make project starts comfortable, easy and fast. A field study was conducted to introduce distributed pair programming (DPP), a derivative of pair programming (PP) in a distributed context, as a new development method to support communication and enhance knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>right</b> from the beginning of the project. Objective: The objective of the study was to uncover relevant procedures and problems of establishing DPP and to collect supporting procedure steps for future project starts in distributed collaborations. Methods: A variation of canonical action research (CAR) was used to both establish DPP, gather insights and allow feedback from the developers involved. Results: This paper describes the establishment of DPP in a corporate project kick-off. It also reveals some benefits and major problems about distributed collaboration like conflicts in role fulfillment, ambiguity about session goals and missing awareness. Limitations: The validity of this study is threatened by the small number of participants and their particular cultural backgrounds. Keywords: POP-I. A. distributed collaboration, POP-I.

50|$|Cession is a {{particular}} method of <b>transferring</b> <b>rights</b> in a movable incorporeal thing {{in the same manner}} in which delivery or traditio <b>transfers</b> <b>rights</b> in a movable corporeal thing.

The transfer is accomplished by means of an agreement of transfer or oordrags-ooreenkoms between the cedent and the cessionary arising out of a justa causa from which the former's intention to <b>transfer</b> the <b>right</b> (animus transferendi) and the latter's intention to become the holder of the right (animus acquirendi) appears or can be inferred.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{examined}} the effects of secure tenure on agricultural investment and productivity. The authors also study the importance of rights to household residual income and land use being transferable. Contemporary China - where industrialization has spread rapidly, if unevenly - {{is a good place to}} study the economic effects of <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> as well as conventional security of tenure. Village collectives formally own land in China, so there can be no individual land sales, but farmers are sometimes entitled to sell their rights to use the land allocated to them under the household responsibility system. Whether a household has secure tenure depends on whether its landholding will be reduced if the household population declines, whether the landholding will be increased if the household population increases, and how frequent average land adjustments are under the household responsibility system. Analyzing panel data for a sample of farm households, the authors study the"investment regret mitigation effect", which results when greater <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> make households more willing to invest because they are less likely to regret such investments when they can recoup the investment value even if they exit farming. The authors find that <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> may be especially important in an industrializing economy. A property rights system with incomplete security of tenure but with strong <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> that permit"specialization without regret"- so farmers can recoup the value of an investment even if they exit farming - may have much to recommend it.

Specialization without Regret: <b>Transfer</b> <b>Rights,</b> Agricultural Productivity and Investment in an Industrializing Economy Among those mutable factors that constrain economic performance in low income and transitional economies, property rights over land rank high by most calculations. 1 With a few important exceptions, the literature that has tried to quantify the economic effects of property rights has concentrated on the security with which individuals hold rights over land. The goal of this paper is to broaden the focus of these earlier efforts to include <b>transfer</b> <b>rights,</b> meaning an individual’s liberty to rent or sell the use, income and other rights that he or she holds.
