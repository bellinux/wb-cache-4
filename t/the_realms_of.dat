5|$|After the War of Wrath, the Valar {{tried to}} summon the Elves back to Valinor. Many complied, but some stayed. During the Second Age they founded <b>the</b> <b>Realms</b> <b>of</b> Lindon, Eregion and Mirkwood. Sauron, Morgoth’s former servant, made war upon them, but {{with the aid of}} the Númenóreans they {{defeated}} him.|$|E
5|$|Because a {{mainland}} Southern Italian {{team had}} never won the league before, this turned Maradona into a cultural, social and borderline religious icon for Neapolitans, which stretched beyond <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> just football.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's {{greatest}} {{concerns were}} {{the maintenance of}} the royal supremacy and the diffusion of reformed theology and practice. Scholars note that he is best remembered for his contribution to <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> language and of cultural identity. His prose helped to guide the development of the English language, and the Book of Common Prayer is a major contribution to English literature that influenced many lives in the Anglophone world. It guided Anglican worship for four hundred years.|$|E
50|$|Quest Mode is an adventure-style, {{progressive}} levels mode. The Aqui brothers want {{to visit}} their grandfather, which resides in <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Clouds. However, <b>The</b> Aqui brothers need to face <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Ghosts, <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Sweets, <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Jungle, and <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Ice before reaching their destination.|$|R
5000|$|Santayana {{builds on}} his Skepticism and Animal Faith, which he {{described}} {{as a sort of}} precursor to [...] "a new system of philosophy", that would be developed fully in the present work. He defines four <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> being; <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Essence, <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Matter, <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Truth, and <b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Spirit.|$|R
5000|$|... (1) <b>The</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> language, {{consisting}} {{in words}} and sentences. (2) <b>The</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> thought, consisting in subjective ideas and judgements. (3) <b>The</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> logic, consisting in objective ideas (or ideas in themselves) and propositions in themselves.|$|R
5|$|Fortune saw her occult novels as an {{important}} part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings. She thus perceived them as a means of disseminating her teachings to a wider audience. Each was related to one of the Sephirah on the Qabalic Tree of Life: The Winged Bull was associated with Tiphareth, The Goat-Foot God with Malkuth, and The Sea Priestess with Yesod.|$|E
5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E
5|$|Faisalabadi cuisine is {{very much}} Punjabi cuisine, with {{influences}} from <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> the Mughal and Colonial empires. Key ingredients include rice or roti (flatbread) served with a vegetable or non-vegetable curry, a salad consisting of spiced tomatoes and onions, and yogurt. This is usually accompanied {{by a variety of}} South Asian sweets such as jaggery, gajar ka halwa, gulab jamun, and jalebi. Tandoori barbecue specialties consist of a variety of naan bread served with tandoori chicken, chicken tikka or lamb shishkebab served with a mint chutney.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cosmology}} of {{the books}} is composed of four [...] "layers": the Underearth, which is <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> demons; <b>the</b> Flat Earth itself; the Upperearth, which is <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods; and <b>the</b> Innerearth, <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Truth {{was thought}} of well after Santayana {{had thought of}} his other three realms; he envisions it as a sort <b>of</b> {{subdivision}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Essence. Truth is that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Essences instantiated by matter; indeed, he says: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Hammergrim, a {{separate}} plane in <b>the</b> 3rd-Edition Forgotten <b>Realms</b> cosmology {{is located on}} Thuldanin. It is <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duergar god, Laduguer.|$|R
5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E
5|$|Legacy of the Drow is a tetralogy, {{unlike the}} {{previous}} two trilogies. The 1993 short story, Dark Mirror, in <b>the</b> <b>Realms</b> <b>of</b> Valor anthology, describes events {{just prior to the}} series. The first three books, The Legacy, Starless Night, and Siege of Darkness, describe a drow attack on Mithril Hall. Wulfgar is seemingly slain by a yochlol, and Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to prevent his friends from being further attacked by dark elves. The drow launch a second attack against Mithril Hall during the Time of Troubles. It is eventually repelled and Drizzt returns to his friends.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubids {{had been}} under the nominal {{sovereignty}} of the Mongol Empire after a Mongol force targeted Ayyubid territories in Anatolia in 1244. An-Nasir Yusuf sent an embassy to the Mongol capital Karakorum in 1250, shortly after assuming power. These understandings did not last, however, and the Mongol Great Khan, Möngke, issued a directive to his brother Hulagu to extend <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> the empire to the Nile River. The latter raised an army of 120,000 and in 1258, sacked Baghdad and slaughtered its inhabitants, including Caliph al-Musta'sim {{and most of his}} family after the Ayyubids failed to assemble an army to protect the city. That same year the Ayyubids lost Diyar Bakr to the Mongols.|$|E
50|$|The Guardians {{are taken}} into <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beyonder, a {{powerful}} other-dimensional entity. Talon then helps out in a power struggle in <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods, Asgard.|$|R
50|$|Mythic's newest MMORPG, Warhammer Online, {{is also an}} RvR game. It {{features}} the conflict between <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Order and <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Destruction as a core gameplay aspect.|$|R
50|$|Driven in ships {{by great}} wind and waves from the {{downfall}} of Númenor, Elendil landed in the north near <b>the</b> Elven <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Lindon, and there established <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Arnor. Isildur and Anárion landed farther south, establishing <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Gondor, where several Númenóreans had already settled.|$|R
5|$|Tomb of Horrors was revised in late 1977 for {{publication}} as an AD module. In 1978, TSR, Inc. published the module with a monochrome cover, revised and updated {{for use with}} first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The module included a twenty-page book, a twelve-page book, and an outer folder; the original printing featured a two-color cover. The module features a book of illustrations to show to players as the adventure unfolds. Tomb of Horrors was republished in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with identical text but a new, full-color cover. The module {{has been described as}} {{the first of a series}} of high-level scenarios, and was included as part of <b>the</b> <b>Realms</b> <b>of</b> Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{existence}} of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.|$|E
5|$|Ceredigion {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times: 170 hill forts and enclosures {{have been identified}} across the county {{and there are many}} standing stones dating back to the Bronze Age. Around the time of the Roman invasion of Britain, the area was between <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> the Demetae and Ordovices. The Sarn Helen road ran through the territory, with forts at Bremia and Loventium protecting gold mines near present-day Llelio. Following the Roman withdrawal, Irish raids and invasions were repulsed, supposedly by the forces under a northerner named Cunedda. The 9th-century History of the Britons attributed to Nennius records that Cunedda's son Ceredig settled the area around the Teifi in the 5th century. The territory supposedly remained a minor kingdom under his dynasty until its extinction upon the drowning of Gwgon ap Meurig , after which it was administered by Rhodri Mawr of Gwynedd before passing to his son Cadell, whose son Hywel Dda inherited its neighbouring kingdom Dyfed and established the realm of Deheubarth. Records are highly obscure; some historians believe that Hyfaidd ap Bledrig, the Dyfed ruler, may have annexed Ceredigion before his heirs lost it to Hywel through war.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} the cosmos, {{faithful}} Caodaists believe there are heaven and hell, which are the main destinations for souls after death. Heaven consists of thirty six planes and many heavenly <b>realms</b> upon each <b>of</b> them, e.g. <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Saints, <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Mother, <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Perfect Beings, <b>the</b> Divine Court <b>Realm,</b> <b>The</b> Paradise <b>of</b> Extreme Joy, Nirvana, etc. Meanwhile, hell has ten key realms to carry out punishments in accordance with sins of souls.|$|R

50|$|The Oh My Goddess! {{universe}} is fashioned loosely around Celtic/Norse Mythology; various names and concepts are recycled for humor. Three worlds {{exist in the}} Universe of Oh My Goddess: Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Heaven is <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> All Mighty and goddesses, Hell is <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> Hild and demons, and Earth is <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> humans. Reality is controlled by an enormous and complex computer system, named Yggdrasil.|$|R

25|$|In Buddhism, bhava {{denotes the}} {{continuity}} of becoming (reincarnating) in one of <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> existence, in the samsaric context of rebirth, life and the maturation arising therefrom. It is the tenth of the Twelve Nidanas, in its Pratītyasamutpāda doctrine.|$|E
50|$|Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Conscience tells <b>the</b> {{story of}} the life of a protagonist who struggles to survive in the palace, but rises in status through a kind heart. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Conscience, however, is far shorter in length. The {{television}} series is a costume drama, using elaborate costumes and sets to attract audiences. However, Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> Conscience also uses historical figures an events in its plot, such as Grand Empress Dowager Guo.|$|R
