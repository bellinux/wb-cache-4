5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers and won two awards at the 2010 GDC Independent Games Festival. Reviewers praised the cooperative gameplay highly {{but said that}} the single-player was less fun because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> to do. Many comparisons were made between Monaco and other media; the most common being the 1960 heist film Oceans 11. Reviewers liked the art style {{and said that the}} gameplay suited the minimalistic design.|$|E
5|$|City won {{immediate}} promotion as Second Division champions in 1902–03, with Meredith scoring 22 {{goals in}} 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley {{managed to find}} him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, {{who was able to}} win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E
50|$|When <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> {{interfacial}} {{tension between the}} polyelectrolyte particles and the emulsions in question, emulsions <b>are</b> <b>less</b> stable. This <b>is</b> because the polyelectrolyte particles penetrate the flocs in suspension <b>less</b> when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> {{interfacial tension}}.|$|R
5000|$|Flutes: More flutes {{allows a}} higher feed rate, because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> {{material}} removed per flute. But because the core diameter increases, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> room for swarf, so a balance must be chosen.|$|R
60|$|One {{compensation}} I learned. As one grows weaker one <b>is</b> <b>less</b> {{susceptible to}} suffering. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> hurt because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> to hurt. And the man already well weakened grows weaker more slowly. It is of {{common knowledge that}} unusually strong men suffer more severely from ordinary sicknesses than do women or invalids. As the reserves of strength <b>are</b> consumed <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> strength to lose. After all superfluous flesh is gone what is left is stringy and resistant. In fact, that was what I became--a sort of string-like organism that persisted in living.|$|R
5|$|These 18th-century {{improvements}} to the spinning process meant that handloom weavers were in great demand. but as power looms were introduced in factories in Manchester <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> work for them and there was serious unemployment in the town. In 1827 silk weaving began in Leigh, either {{as the result of}} a dispute or a labour shortage in the Middleton silk industry. William Walker was a middleman who opened the first silk mill in Leigh in 1828, and others quickly followed, including James Pownall and Henry Hilton, whose mill survived until 1926.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants and traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks. To their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than a 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E
30|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> more samples {{with a lower}} {{resistance}} {{compared to}} the higher end. The VLS method yielded high resistance samples and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> VLS samples compared to the aqeuous solution samples [22, 23]. Hence, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> data points in the higher resistance part of the graph.|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, private turnpike {{companies}} {{constructed and}} improved {{a few of}} the more important roadways in the state. Turnpikes were chartered by the state and privately financed, with tolls collected at toll houses every few miles along the road. The first turnpike in Delaware was the Newport Gap Pike, which was built in 1808 and completed to Wilmington in 1811. Many other turnpikes were constructed in northern New Castle County radiating from Wilmington and connected the industrial city to agricultural areas. The turnpikes were built as straight roads in order to reduce costs. Many of these roads were constructed with a macadam surface. During the course of the 19th century, new methods of transportation such as canals and railroads came about and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> investment on roads. The revenues of the turnpike companies fell and roads became more of a local concern.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{flooding}} {{occurred after}} the Cauto River overflowed it banks, making driving impossible. The storm severed communications between towns in eastern Cuba after bringing down telephone and telegraph wires. Apart from seven structures ruined in the Guantánamo area, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> destruction in many locations than initially feared. There were reports of three fatalities in Caimanera, and one person died in Santiago de Cuba. At least 29 individuals were treated for storm-related injuries. Damage assessments {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the storm placed monetary damages in Cuba at $500,000. In the aftermath, a public curfew was issued for Santiago de Cuba, forcing residents to remain indoors after 8 pm. To prevent looting, troops patrolled streets and vulnerable locations, such as banks. Supplies of bread and milk ran short following the hurricane.|$|E

25|$|The {{grammar of}} the ancient Kannada {{language}} was in general more complex than of modern Kannada. Phonology wise, there was full use of the now obsolete letters ೞ and ಱ (i.e. same as in Tamil and Malayalam). Aspirated letters were not normally used, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> an influence from Sanskrit.|$|E

25|$|Between 2012 and 2016, the hexagon {{changed from}} a mostly blue color to more of a golden color.

25|$|The runestones {{show the}} {{different}} ways in which Christianity changed Norse society, and one of the greatest changes involved no longer burying the deceased on the clan's grave field among his ancestors. Instead, he was buried in the cemetery of the church, while the runestone would serve as a memorial at the homestead, but for certain families, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> change as they had churches built adjoining the family grave field.|$|E
