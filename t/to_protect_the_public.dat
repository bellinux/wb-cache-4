Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture.

25|$|In Holt v.

The Pulaski County circuit court made a summary judgment dismissing the suit, and Mr. Holt appealed. In 1991, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's decision, finding that the pit bull ordinance was not impermissibly vague, that the restrictions were reasonable, and that any agreement made by the city to limit its own legislative powers was null and void since the city's first duty was <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> interest.|$|E
