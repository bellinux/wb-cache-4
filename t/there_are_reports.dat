5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports,</b> however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of its success.|$|E

5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 {{a flock of}} mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E
5|$|These snakes {{do well in}} captivity, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E

5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|The PIP and Para {{versions}} of the M249 {{have been used in}} the Iraq war since the invasion. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape. The lethality of the 5.56mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up and jam if they are not cleaned frequently.|$|E
5|$|Though silvertip {{sharks are}} quite mobile, they exhibit {{fidelity}} to certain areas and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered {{alone or in}} pairs. Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water. Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of equal size when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites. They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).|$|E

5|$|Al-Azhar {{nevertheless}} {{remained the}} seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> that a scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, taught a number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, {{the policies of the}} Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.|$|E
5|$|The addax inhabits arid regions, semideserts {{and sandy}} and stony deserts. They even occur in {{extremely}} arid areas, {{with less than}} 100mm annual rainfall. They also inhabit deserts with tussock grasses (Stipagrostis species) and succulent thorn scrub Cornulaca. Formerly, the addax was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; but today the only known self-sustaining population {{is present in the}} Termit Massif Reserve (Niger). However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (Niger) and Bodélé (Chad). Rare nomads may be seen in north Niger, southern Algeria and Libya; and the antelope is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there are no confirmed sightings. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|True Thescelosaurus remains {{are known}} {{definitely}} only from late Maastrichtian-age rocks, from Alberta (Scollard Formation) and Saskatchewan (Frenchman Formation), Canada, and Wyoming (Lance Formation), South Dakota (Hell Creek Formation), Montana (Hell Creek), and Colorado (Laramie Formation), USA. With {{the exception of}} birds, {{it was one of}} the last genera of dinosaurs, its remains being found as close as 3meters to the boundary clay containing the iridium layer that closes the Cretaceous. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of teeth from older, Campanian-age rocks, particularly from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, but these specimens are not from Thescelosaurus and are much more likely those of Orodromeus. More specimens are known than have been officially described for this genus, such as the Triebold specimen, which has been the source of several skeletal casts for museums.|$|E

5|$|Across {{most of its}} range, the pied butcherbird can {{generally}} be found breeding from winter to summer; eggs are laid anywhere from July to December, but mostly from September to November, and young can {{be present in the}} nest from August till February. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> of breeding outside these months, however. The nest is constructed of dry sticks with a finer material such as dried grass, black roly poly (Sclerolaena muricata), bark and leaves forming a cup-shaped interior. It is located in the fork of a tree, often among foliage and inconspicuous. The clutch consists of two to five (most commonly three or four) oval eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green. Larger clutches have been recorded, such as at Jandowae in Queensland, where two pairs laid eggs and were sharing incubation duties. Eggs of subspecies nigrogularis are larger, at around 33mm long by 24mm (1.3 by 0.95in) wide, while those of subspecies picatus are around 31mm long by 22mm (1.2 by 0.85in) wide. Incubation takes 19 to 21 days, with the eggs laid up to 48 hours apart and hatching at a similar interval. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born naked or sparsely covered in down and blind. They spend anywhere from 25 to 33 days in the nest before fledging, though may leave the nest early if disturbed. They are fed by parents and helper birds. Brood parasites recorded include the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae).|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>reports</b> in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
