5|$|Arthur {{was murdered}} (allegedly by John), {{and his sister}} Eleanor would {{spend the rest of}} her life in captivity. John's {{behaviour}} drove a number of French barons <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with Philip, and the resulting rebellions by Norman and Angevin barons ended John's control of his continental possessions—the de facto end of the Angevin Empire, although Henry III would maintain his claim until 1259.|$|E
5|$|Harry Woods, the {{publisher}} of the other major newspaper, The Daily Nugget, was an undersheriff to Behan. He and his newspaper tended <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with Behan, the Cowboys (some of whom were part-time ranchers and landowners), and the rural interests of the ranchers.|$|E

5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5|$|In Spring 2011, WSDOT began a $4.63million {{construction}} project to build wider lanes and shoulders on SR22 between I-82 {{and the city}} of Toppenish, because of a number of collisions along the roadway. Other improvements included installing new sidewalks with ADA-compliant curbs and access ramps, as well as adding turn lanes <b>to</b> <b>side</b> roads. The project was completed in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the slums}} of Athkatla, a man named Gaelan Bayle offers the party {{the help of a}} {{powerful}} organization, who can find Imoen or Irenicus for the large sum of 20,000 gold pieces. The party is approached by and offered the help of another rival guild headed by Bodhi; it is the player's choice whom <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with.|$|E
50|$|While the cantoris side of {{the choir}} {{corresponds}} <b>to</b> the Gospel <b>side</b> of the altar (so called from the custom of reading the Epistle from {{the south end of}} the altar, and the Gospel from the north end of the altar), cantoris and decani properly refer only <b>to</b> <b>sides</b> of the choir, not <b>to</b> the <b>sides</b> of the altar.|$|R

5|$|Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid {{that saves}} Queen Amidala's ship when other droids fail. Before the film's {{production}} started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would remain. Baker {{is used for}} scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side <b>to</b> <b>side.</b> Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable events during this period was the Treaty of St. Louis in which the Sac and Fox tribes ceded northeastern Missouri, {{northern}} Illinois and southern Wisconsin to the United States. Resentments over this treaty were to cause the tribes <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with the British during the War of 1812 in raids along the Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and was to spur the Black Hawk War in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Su Dingfang {{recruited}} tribes <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with Tang, {{and these}} former tribal vassals of the Western Turks contributed additional soldiers. The tribe Chumukun offered their support {{after they were}} defeated by Su, and the tribe Nishu aided Su after their children and wives, originally captured by Helu, were returned along with gifts offered by the Tang.|$|E

5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted <b>to</b> <b>side</b> hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers {{its head and}} sways it from side <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching with wings spread out.|$|E
5|$|When tufted males clap, females look {{towards them}} and display {{a greater number}} of tap {{displays}} to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping more often by settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female more often than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens from side <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

25|$|An open (non-locking or {{otherwise}} traction-aided) differential always supplies close to equal torque <b>to</b> each <b>side.</b> <b>To</b> illustrate how this can limit torque {{applied to the}} driving wheels, imagine a simple rear-wheel drive vehicle, with one rear roadwheel on asphalt with good grip, {{and the other on}} a patch of slippery ice. It takes very little torque <b>to</b> spin the <b>side</b> on slippery ice, and because a differential splits torque equally <b>to</b> each <b>side,</b> the torque that is applied <b>to</b> the <b>side</b> that is on asphalt is limited to this amount.|$|R

5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads from side <b>to</b> <b>side</b> as if {{in an effort to}} be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|A final {{showdown}} ensues with Lazarus, {{in which}} Jericho arises victorious, and a choice is given for him <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the West of the Curse of Lazarus, or {{he becomes the}} Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala; if the player chooses to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding into the night, while the good ending shows Cassidy's soul being released.|$|E
5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage <b>to</b> <b>Side</b> before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E

5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken {{in a series}} of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth went over to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by the representatives of the two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E
5|$|After Sim Snuka, {{the son of}} Jimmy Snuka, also {{expressed}} interest in joining the group, Orton made them qualify {{through a series of}} tests which Manu failed the first week. On the January 5 episode of Raw, Snuka and Rhodes won a tag team match against Cryme Tyme. Before the match, Orton informed them that they had to win the match in order {{to be part of the}} group. After the match, Orton explained that since Snuka did not pick up the pinfall, he was out of the group. The following week, Manu and Snuka informed Rhodes that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving Rhodes an ultimatum to choose a side. When Rhodes refused <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault Rhodes and Orton. Instead DiBiase joined The Legacy, attacking Manu and Snuka, and forgiving Orton for attacking him.|$|E
5|$|As {{the civil}} war in England {{developed}} into a long and protracted conflict, both the King and the English Parliamentarians appealed to the Scots for military aid. The Covenanters opted <b>to</b> <b>side</b> with Parliament and in 1643 they entered into a Solemn League and Covenant, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement and promising further reform in England. In January 1644 a Scots army of 18,000 foot and 3,000 horse and guns under Leslie crossed the border. It helped turn the tide of the war in the North, forcing the royalist army under the Marquis of Newcastle into York where it was besieged by combined Scots and Parliamentary armies. The Royalists were relieved by a force under Prince Rupert, the King's nephew, but the allies under Leslie's command defeated the Royalists decisively at Marston Moor on 2 July, generally seen as the turning point of the war.|$|E
