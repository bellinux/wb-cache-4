There have been no numerical simulation studies so far which have discussed the detailed propagation characteristics of horizontal Rayleigh waves accompanied by vertical acoustic waves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on <b>traveling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> with a propagation velocity range of a few km/s. Tanaka et al. (1984) and Ducic et al.

In this event, a dense, patchy sporadic E layer was detected that exhibited type I (two-stream) coherent echoes while, at the same time, the F-layer plasma was highly structured with plasma drifts of hundreds of m/s.

30|$|Two radio {{sources are}} loaded on Rstar and Vstar, with each {{transmitting}} three carriers in the S-band and one carrier in the X-band. In {{the work of}} Kono et al. (2003), these sources help address cycle ambiguity using the multi-frequency VLBI (MFV) method (Kono et al., 2003), especially using the same-beam MFV method, when the elongation between two nearby spacecrafts is smaller than the beam width of the ground antenna (Liu et al., 2007; Kikuchi et al., 2009). In their methods, cycle ambiguity was derived analytically. The residual phase equation pairs were deduced individually, relying on strict error conditions, e.g. the error of the correlation phase must be less than 4.3 °. Further, the ionospheric fluctuation must be less than 0.23 TECU (1 TECU equals 1016 el/m 2). The TEC condition is more difficult for switching VLBI when a <b>traveling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> occurs in the ionosphere.

30|$|The same beam VLBI method (SBV) is newly {{applied to}} the {{multi-frequency}} VLBI method in the VRAD mission of SELENE (KAGUYA). By simultaneously observing two nearby spacecraft with one antenna, the error sources of VLBI measurement common in two propagation paths can be almost canceled out. In this paper, error estimation and simulation analysis are carried out for a feasibility study to apply the SBV method to the VRAD mission. Differential phase delay can be estimated without cycle ambiguity even if tropospheric fluctuation is large and/or <b>traveling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> occurs. The sensitivity of the differential phase delay {{with respect to the}} average elevation angle and the elongation of two spacecraft is also investigated. Moreover, a method is developed for estimating differential phase delay in switching VLBI observations using the cycle ambiguity derived from SBV observations. This method can be performed in more than 90 % of the VRAD mission’s total paths. Precise positioning with SBV contributes to accurate estimation of the low degree coefficients of lunar gravity fields by more than one order of magnitude than previous results.|$|E

The ionopsheric storm and trough can enlarge the bending angle RIE standard deviations by more than 20 times, and TID can enlarge the bending angle RIE standard deviations by several times. Under the influence of ionospheric disturbances, temperature errors can reach 8 K and can pollute the GPS RO daily-mean and month-mean observations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} studies investigating the composition and dynamics of the low latitude F-region ionosphere using airglow imagers and the Arecibo and Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars (ISRs), along with supporting instrumentation. Some dynamical aspects of the low latitude ionosphere are investigated. The ef-fects of a large-scale <b>traveling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (TID) are studied. The TID characteristics are consistent with an atmospheric disturbance caused by high lati-tude Lorentz forcing associated with periodic substorms. Plasmaspheric coupling is necessary to explain the observed electron densities and airglow intensities. Evidence is presented for post-midnight uplifts during which the low latitude iono-sphere is lifted by tens of kilometers in mild events and by over a hundred kilometers in severe events. The uplifts are not caused by a reversal of the zonal electric field, instead occurring as a response to a decreasing westward field in conjunction with sufficient recombination and plasma flux. The midnight pressure bulge {{may play a role in}} the dynamics and the disturbance dynamo may enhance the uplifts.

We demonstrated that global ground-based GPS receivers {{could be used to}} monitor such disturbances. One of the main objectives of this paper has been to point out the complexities of using a global network of GPS receivers to monitor and detect natural-hazard generated TEC perturbations. To achieve our objective we have processed 300 GPS stations using a global network of GPS receivers displayed in Fig. 3. We used JPL’s PyIono package to process the slant TEC observations. Subsequently, we band-pass filtered the slant TEC measurements to generate filtered TEC observations. We showed that using about 300 GPS receivers we are able to map high and low latitude TEC disturbances, traveling ionospheric disturbances and the Tohoku earthquake generated TEC perturbations caused by acoustic and gravity waves. We also showed that March 10 and 11 exhibited disturbed geomagnetic conditions with high-latitude and low-latitude TEC perturbations.

30|$|We {{report the}} first {{observation}} of the disappearance of a plasma bubble over geomagnetically conjugate points. It was observed by airglow imagers at Darwin, Australia (magnetic latitude: − 22 °N) and Sata, Japan (21 °N) on 8 August 2002. The plasma bubble was observed in 630 -nm airglow images from 1530 (0030 LT) to 1800 UT (0300 LT) and disappeared equatorward at 1800 to 1900 UT (0300 to 0400 LT) {{in the field of}} view. The ionograms at Darwin and Yamagawa (20 km north of Sata) show strong spread-F signatures at approximately 16 to 21 UT. At Darwin, the F-layer virtual height suddenly increased from approximately 200 to approximately 260 km at the time of bubble disappearance. However, a similar F-layer height increase was not observed over the conjugate point at Yamagawa, indicating that this F-layer rise was caused not by an eastward electric field but by enhancement of the equatorward thermospheric wind over Darwin. We think that this enhancement of the equatorward neutral wind was caused by an equatorward-propagating large-scale <b>traveling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance,</b> which was identified in the north-south keogram of 630 -nm airglow images. We speculate that polarization electric field associated with this equatorward neutral wind drive plasma drift across the magnetic field line to cause the observed bubble disappearance.|$|E

The fluctuations in the AE-C data are found at times of low magnetic activity to extend from the auroral region in one hemisphere across the equator to the corresponding region in the other hemisphere with little change in apparent wavelength. The fluctuations in the AE-E data similarly exhibit at times of low magnetic activity nearly uniform wave structure encircling the equatorial belt. Typical examples of waves of more than 1000 km apparent wavelength in both the AE-C and AE-E data are presented.

Since December 1991, imaging observations with the MAIS have been conducted at the Zao observatory (38.09 °N, 140.56 °E). From these observations, two interesting events with wave structures have been detected in OI 630 -nm nightglow images. The first event was observed {{on the night of}} June 2 / 3, 1992 during a geomagnetically quiet period. Simultaneous data of ionospheric parameters showed that they are caused by propagation of the medium-scale <b>traveling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (TID). Phase velocity and horizontal wavelength determined from the image data are 45 – 100 m/s and ∼ 280 km, and the propagation direction is south-westward. The second event was observed on the night of February 27 / 28, 1992 during a geomagnetic storm. It is found that a large enhancement of OI 630 -nm emission is caused by a propagation of the large-scale TID. Meridional components of phase velocities and wavelengths determined from ionospheric data are 305 – 695 m/s (southward) and 930 – 5250 km.
