40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation into the engineering geology properties of three pyroclastic deposits from the Colli Albani volcanic complex, typical of the subsoil of Rome (Italy). In their natural state, these materials are coarse-grained weak rocks, generally unsaturated in situ. The mechanical properties of the material are related to the geological origin of the deposits, their formation environment and mechanisms. These are also revealed by peculiar microstructural features. A <b>technical</b> <b>sheet</b> for the description and classification of these deposits is proposed in the paper. The experimental investigation consisted mainly of identification and classification tests, one-dimensional compression and direct shear tests on saturated and dry samples. Due to their nature, non standard techniques had to be developed for sample preparation and testing.

40|$|Quality Control (QC) {{is a set}} of procedures, {{including}} technical activities, {{to ensure}} that a final product or a performed service adheres to a defined set of quality criteria and meets the customer requirements. Quality assurance (QA) is defined as a systematic process to check whether a service/product under development is meeting specific requirements before the product or service is completed. The non-proliferation treaty (NPT) comprises a verification mechanism: nuclear safeguards. Safeguards aims at the verification of the non-diversion of fissile material from its intended and declared (peaceful) use. Therefore a reliable nuclear material accountancy system has to be established by the plant operator. This accountancy is subject to independent verification by the safeguards authorities. Measurement of samples (for their content in U or Pu and the respective isotopic composition) taken by inspectors remains the backbone of any verification system. Environmental sampling is a supplementary safeguards tool aiming at verifying the correctness and completeness of a state¿s declarations. The system of measurements applied in nuclear safeguards is expected to conform to the latest standards. This <b>technical</b> <b>sheet</b> lists the different aspects of QA and QC in analytical measurements, explains the fundamental role of reference materials, quality control samples, uncertainty of measurement results and interlaboratory comparisons in view of measurements of the nuclear fuel cycle materials.

The research method was an experiment that involved two farms that grew 150 ha of tobacco applying the technology developed and recommended by the Institute. The obtained results demonstrated that the increase of the tobacco economic efficiency can be conditioned by an increased productivity of tobacco plants, improved use of means of production, labor productivity and quantity of high quality tobacco, thus production is intensified the higher the final revenue is. According to the development indexes the growth of tobacco decreased substantially. Thus, the area under tobacco decreased in 2011 compared to 2005 by 60. 5 % (absolute value of 2. 086 thousand hectares) whereas the yield per hectare remained stable - 1. 53 t / ha in both years. The same scenario was observer on the farms where tobacco cultivation was conducted according to <b>technical</b> <b>sheet.</b> On the Festelita farm in 2011 tobacco was grown on a 100 ha. In 2009 - 2011 the average yield was 2. 25 - 2. 3 t / ha. The quality of the raw material constituted 89 % on average being sold for 21000 i lei per ton.

40|$|Background: According to the American Academy of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, {{more than}} 11 million {{cosmetic}} surgical and nonsurgical procedures were performed by board-certified plastic surgeons, dermatologists and otolaryngologists in the United States, {{totaling more than}} 12 billion dollars. Of that total, more than 7 billion was spent on surgical procedures and more than 5 billion was spent on nonsurgical procedures. More than 1, 872, 172 people received Hyaluronic Acid (HA) injections in 2013. Moreover, filler treatments {{are the most popular}} procedures performed by dermatologists. Objective: Evaluate, with a new imaging system, durability, efficacy and safety of a nasolabial fold treatment with a cross-linked HA of non-animal origin with different molecular weights. Material and methods: A cross-linked HA (25 mg/ml, 1000 - 2000 kDa, 23 ± 3 Newton [N] extrusion force, 1, 4 -Butanediol Diglycidyl Ether (BDDE) content < 0. 1 ppm) was used in order to perform the treatment. The product is commercially available with the trademark Aliaxin®GP (Global Performance) and distributed by IBSA Farmaceutici Italia Srl. 25 female subjects aged 40 and 60 years with a photoageing level III according Rubin or type III according Glogau were recruited for the treatment and 0. 5 ml of the product were injected for single nasolabial fold. The aesthetic result and the duration of the aesthetic correction were evaluated by the analysis of the skin microreliefs through confocal microscopy and by Glogau's Scale. Additionally, pictures of each patient were collected by Canon PowerShot G 10 Digital Camera (14. 7 megapixels) before and after treatment. Below the description of the experimental schedule: T 0 : Baseline, evaluation and treatment; T 1 : second visit, 4 months after the treatment; T 2 : third visit, 6 months after the treatment. Results: From 25 patients, 150 silicone casts were obtained: 75 casts of the right nasolabial fold and 75 casts of the left nasolabial fold. Roughness arithmetical average (Ra) was assessed by profilometry. This parameter represents the arithmetic mean deviation of the profile points compared to the average value. The Ra of the right fold at T 2 decreased by 50 % versus T 0 and by 40 % compared to T 1; Ra of the left fold at T 2 decreased by the 45 % versus T 0 and by 35 % compared to T 1.

40|$|The {{expertise}} of both industry and research institutes {{has created an}} important collection of knowledge on food processes, {{which is the result}} of scientific and technological research and experimental know- how. However, despite a great number of results published in the form of “peer” reviewed papers and patents, it has been failed to formalize, organize and complete the acquired knowledge. The need for a sustained capitalization is crucial in view of: i) preventing the loss of knowledge due to the departure of employees over the years; ii) avoiding the dispersal of existing experimental data; iii) and finally, allowing optimal exploitation of data and knowledge. The objective of this work is to address these challenges by developing an electronic knowledge book (kBook) of one specific food process, the microfiltration of skimmed milk. Microfiltration of skimmed milk is widely used in the dairy industry to separate casein micelles from soluble protein aiming at producing a retentate used in cheese making and a permeate containing whey proteins with valuable nutritional and functional properties. Due to the increasingly use of this operation at industrial scale, {{there is a need to}} collect and correlate the existing knowledge in a structured way and to gain a better insight of the overall process. The knowledge was first elicited through semi-structured interviews with a group of experts on dairy filtration. Concomitantly, data and knowledge from patents and literature was collated. In a next step, a kBook was established, whose pages were formatted in concept maps (cmap) and <b>technical</b> <b>sheets</b> that are connected by hypertext links. A cmap is a semantic graph where nodes represent concepts that are connected by arcs expressing the relationships between them. A formatted cmap answers a specific question about one central concept. The hyperlinks between cmaps, <b>technical</b> <b>sheets</b> and cmaps and <b>technical</b> <b>sheets</b> form a network of knowledge which can be browsed by the user to find relevant answers to its questions. Several knowledge areas have been identified so far including milk pretreatment, microbiological stabilization, microfiltration and analytical methods for the characterization of fractions. A global representation of the overall process from raw milk to fractions of proteins, based on the individual cmaps has been built. The practical structuration of the knowledge and the original version of the kBook will be disclosed at the congress.

40|$|The {{existence}} of pilot and industrial scale biorefineries worldwide demonstrates the technical andeconomic feasibility of fractionating lignocellulose (LC) for chemistry and energy. This raisesnew {{questions about the}} biomass supply, management of its quality and about the elementary stepcombination in processes, to choose which compound will be main- or co-products from plantbiomass. Integrated and systemic approaches are requested to invent and/or to improve the biotechnicalfractionation of LCs {{and there is a}} need to collect and correlate the existing knowledge in astructured way, to gain a better insight of the overall process. Building such a knowledgerepresentation is important for scientists, research institutes, universities and industries, as it willgive a shared description of the knowledge in that field, that will further facilitate its diffusion,re-use, review, reassessment and updating with new findings. Practically, an extensive literature has been published in the past five years on the biorefinery ofLC, focusing mostly on the saccharification of polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose). As aconsequence, most of the data available results from biochemical and physicochemical analyzesfrom several processing chains, which combine different modes of physical pretreatments and/orchemical typologies of variables biomass and/or various hydrolytic enzyme cocktails. That is why a project for development of a hypertext electronic Knowledge Book onLignoCellulose DeConstruction (KB-LCDC) was initiated by the French National Institute forAgricultural Research (INRA) with two main goals: i/ to elicit the available knowledge fromvarious sources, more specifically related to the enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw intoglucose, ii/ to represent the knowledge and implement it into a web-based format of KnowledgeBook (KB) taking into account the overall saccharification process. The knowledge was first elicited by means of semi-structured interviews with a group of sixexperts working in several INRA research Units, and involved in the Institute’s biomass transformation network. Concomitantly, the collating of data and knowledge from “grey-” andpeer reviewed- literature was also done. Then, our approach consists in building a knowledge book (KB) whose pages are formattedconcept maps (Cmap) and technical sheets that are connected by hypertext links. A Cmap is asemantic graph where nodes represent concepts that are connected by arcs expressingrelationships between them. A formatted Cmap answers a specific question about one centralconcept (for instance: what is the impact of the pretreatment on the reactivity of biomass ? Howdoes enzyme diffuse into the lignocellulose ?). Hyperlinks existing between Cmaps and technicalsheets form a network of knowledge, into which the user can navigate, to find relevant answers,but also associated concepts. Hyperlinks can also link Cmaps or <b>technical</b> <b>sheet</b> to an Internetpage, scientific article and any document selected to illustrate the reality of a concept. Up to nine knowledge areas have been identified so far, among them: biomass pretreatment;separation methods; enzyme cocktails; substrate reactivity, hydrolysis mechanisms. A globalrepresentation of the overall process from wheat straw to glucose, based on the individual Cmaps,has been built. It includes a static structural view (environment and reactivity of the media,encompassing the cell wall); a dynamic view (hierarchy of the different sub-processes at work) and a functional view (description of the elementary steps and how they are organized in time). In the frame of the LBT III congress, the practical structuration of the knowledge and the originalversion of the KB will be disclosed. The potential development and use of this new approach forthe representation of biotechnology processes applied to LC will be discussed (process workflow;unlocking cell wall recalcitrance; strategic roadmaps) ...|$|E
