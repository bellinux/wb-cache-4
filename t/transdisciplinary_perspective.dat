40|$|This article {{seeks to}} address and direct future {{research}} collaboration {{in public policy}} and administration from a <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspective</b> in South Africa, by answering three major questions: Firstly, how can public administration be understood from a <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspective?</b> To demonstrate the development of public administration vis-a-vis trends in contemporary public policy and administration in South Africa? And establish the scope for future collaborative research in public policy and administration from a transdisciplinarity perspective in South Africa? This article uses themes in the qualitative realm to provide answers to the research aims: two special editions of Future, Transdisciplinary Manifesto and over 100 journal articles were read and scanned to provide evidence for the arguments in this article. It concludes {{that the need for}} transdisciplinarity in public policy and administration cannot be undermined or overlooked as a result of depleting strategies, theories, models and frameworks in resolving complex society quagmires from a disciplinary or interdisciplinary nomenclature...|$|E

40|$|For {{many decades}} now library {{practitioners}} have been generating a vast literature {{concerned with the}} “library of the future. ” While much of this literature may be classified according to its imperatives for radical versus incremental change, what is largely absent from these articles is a theoretical understanding of the underlying ideological bases of their arguments, as well as extrinsic or <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Reconsidering these prescriptions {{for the future of}} the library through the lens of futures studies has the potential to afford us critical perspectives on their ideological foundations.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{highlights}} {{the relation of}} congruence and complementarity between disciplinary knowledge and the transdisciplinary one. Without being a new discipline, transdisciplinary emerges from disciplinary research, {{which in turn is}} clarified by the transdisciplinary knowledge. First mention of transdisciplinary concept was made in 1970 at the international workshop “L’interdisciplinarité - Problemes d’enseignement et de recherch dans les universités” organized by OCDE in Nisa; the concept was mentioned during the talks among Jean Piaget, Erich Jantsch and André Lichnerowicz. Psychology, as a form of disciplinary knowledge, could benefit from the revitalization and enrichment of its field by approaching a <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspective.</b> This would help achieve a subjective objectivity and an objective subjectivity, by constantly questioning and always check understanding...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to expand the bioethics notion expressed in the Article 17 th of the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, concerning the interconnections between human beings and other life forms. For this purpose, it is combined the transdisciplinary methodology with the theoretical framework of the “Big History” to approach the co-evolutionary phenomena that life is developing on Earth for some 3. 8 billion years. As a result, the study introduces us to the unification, integration and inclusion {{of the history of}} the universe, the solar system, Earth, and life with the history of human beings. In conclusion, I consider to safeguard the cosmic miracle that represents the emergence of life we must adopt new <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspectives</b> into bioethics to address the ecosystem complexity of co-evolutionary processes of life on Gaia as a whole...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{significance}} of the ‘somatic’ and ‘ontological turn’ in locating the radical politics articulated in the contemporary performance, installation, video and digital art practices of New Delhi-based artist, Sonia Khurana (b. 1968). Since the late 1990 s Khurana has fashioned a range of artworks that require new sorts of reciprocal and embodied relations with their viewers. While this line of art practice suggests the need for a primarily philosophical mode of inquiry into an art of the body, such affective relations need to be historicised also in relation to a discursive field of ‘difference’ and public expectations about the artist’s ethnic, gendered and national identity. Thus, this intimate, visceral and emotional field of inter- and intra-action is a novel contribution to recent <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspectives</b> on the gendered, social and sentient body, that in turn prompts a wider debate on the ethics of cultural commentary and art historiography...|$|R
30|$|Reference {{was made}} to several actions and targets (Sassa 2017 a), which offered several viable {{strategic}} lines of engagement. These initiatives included the identification of root causes and risk drivers of landslides, particularly those related to land use, land development, and the consequent exposure of vulnerable communities to landslides {{as a result of}} population growth and lack of territorial management. To better understand and reduce landslide disaster risk, appropriate and periodic science-based risk assessments should be undertaken and better networking must be sought to enhance the interaction of all stakeholders. Cognizant of the fact that landslide disaster risk reduction is a cross-cutting concern, landscape mitigation has to be addressed by considering multiscale (with particular emphasis on local level), multihazard, <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Multiple speakers advocated an integrated approach on disaster risk research, a structure that is most likely to guarantee the codesign and coproduction of knowledge needed to strengthen decision making and practice for the benefit of society.|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} a {{considerable}} progress in comorbidity research and huge literature on it, this phenomenon {{is one of the}} greatest epistemological, research and clinical challenges to contemporary psychiatry and medicine. Mental disorders are very often comorbidly expressed, both among themselves and with various sorts of somatic diseases and illnesses. Therefore, comorbidity studies have been expected to be an impetus to research on the validity of current diagnostic systems as well as on establishing more effective and efﬁ cient treatment within the frame of person centered transdisciplinary psychiatry and integrative medicine.

40|$|Increasing children's {{physical}} activity at {{school is a}} national focus in the U. S. to address childhood obesity. While research has demonstrated associations between aspects of school environments and students' {{physical activity}}, the literature currently lacks a synthesis of evidence {{to serve as a}} practical, spatially-organized resource for school designers and decision-makers, as well as to point to pertinent research opportunities.

Its aims are to provide architects and designers, as well as school planners, educators, and public health professionals, with strategies for making K- 12 school environments conducive to healthy physical activity, and to engage scientists in <b>transdisciplinary</b> <b>perspectives</b> toward improved knowledge of the school environment's impact. We used a qualitative review process to develop evidence-based and theory-driven school design guidelines that promote increased physical activity among students. The design guidelines include specific strategies in 10 school design domains. Implementation of the guidelines is expected to enable students to adopt healthier physical activity behaviors. The tool bridges a translational gap between research and environmental design practice, and may contribute to setting new industry and education standards...|$|R
