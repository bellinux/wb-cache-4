5|$|At the time, World War II {{had broken}} out and by mid-1940, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had fallen to Nazi Germany.

5|$|His friend George Gray, {{himself a}} {{champion}} shooter, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he had reduced sniping casualties from five a week per battalion to forty-four {{in three months}} in sixty battalions; by his reckoning, this meant that Hesketh-Prichard had saved over 3,500 lives. He was promoted to major in November 1916. By {{this time in the}} war, his contributions to sniping had been such that the former German superiority in the practice had now been reversed.|$|E
5|$|His {{subsequent}} {{involvement in}} a conference promoting adolescent sexuality caused the party to announce that {{it would no longer}} publish his material. In March 1933 Freud <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> his contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish Character Analysis had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was almost certainly because of Reich's stance on teenage sex.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that {{that made his}} position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he}} had been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to Australia Dowling angrily accused the English cricket {{community}} of pre-judging Meckiff. Dowling said the strident press attacks on Meckiff had amounted to intimidation of umpires through the media, and claimed that some administrators had privately <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the Australian paceman would be called if he toured England. The president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, Sir Hubert Ashton, said he hoped Australia would not choose Meckiff for their 1961 tour.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Vrba {{is clear}} that warning the Hungarian {{community}} {{was one of the}} motives for his escape. He wrote that in January 1944 a Polish kapo <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> a million Hungarian Jews would soon arrive at Auschwitz, and that a new railway line was being built to accommodate them. He also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon be eating Hungarian salami.|$|E

5|$|When Dave Toschi met Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt, the {{director}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not}} going to make another Dirty Harry (which had been loosely based on the Zodiac case). Toschi was impressed with their knowledge of the case and afterwards, he realized that he had learned a lot from them. In addition, the Zodiac's two surviving victims, Mike Mageau and Bryan Hartnell were consultants on the film.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of rehab he {{recovered}} earlier than expected. His 2008–09 season started on 25 November, as Gradi gave him a start at the Walkers Stadium, where Leicester City won 2–1. The next month he played six games, keeping four clean sheets (against Carlisle United, Cheltenham Town, Swindon Town and Millwall). However he attracted criticism from his manager {{at the end of}} January following heavy defeats to Northampton Town and Peterborough United, and was subsequently dropped. New manager Gudjon Thordarson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he would not be offered a new contract {{at the end of the}} season, thus ending Tomlinson's long association with the club.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, as Scott's ships neared Cape Hunter at the {{northwest}} end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott's cruisers launched floatplanes. One crashed on takeoff, {{but the other}} two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom Sound. As the floatplanes were launched, Jojima's force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each other. At 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima's force later heard Scott's floatplanes overhead while unloading along {{the north shore of}} Guadalcanal, they failed to report this to Gotō.|$|E
