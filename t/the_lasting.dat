5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E
5|$|According {{to modern}} genealogies {{the father of}} Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was {{a son of a}} {{previous}} ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Windsor married Simpson, who {{had changed}} her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, in a private {{ceremony}} on 3 June 1937, at Château de Candé, near Tours, France. When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade {{members of the royal}} family to attend, to <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{was among}} the most {{powerful}} economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. It was one of the largest empires in world history. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres. It held sway over an estimated 70million people, at that time 21% of the world's entire population. The longevity and vast extent of the empire ensured <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> influence of Latin and Greek language, culture, religion, inventions, architecture, philosophy, law and forms of government on the empire's descendants. Throughout the European medieval period, attempts were even made to establish successors to the Roman Empire, including the Empire of Romania, a Crusader state, and the Holy Roman Empire. By means of European colonialism following the Renaissance, and their descendant states, Greco-Roman and Judaeo-Christian culture was exported on a worldwide scale, playing {{a crucial role in the}} development of the modern world.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} use {{of royal}} arms {{dates from the}} reign of Richard I (1189-1199). Lions had previously {{been used by the}} Norman dynasty as royal emblems, and much later, Attributed arms were retrospectively invented for kings who pre-dated the systematisation of hereditary English heraldry that occurred {{in the second half of}} the 12th century. Henry II (1133–1189) used a lion as his emblem, and may have used a coat of arms with a single lion or two lions, but no documentation of this survives. His children experimented with different combinations of lions on their arms. Richard I (1189–1199) used a single lion rampant, or perhaps two lions affrontés, on his first seal, but later used three lions passant in his 1198 Great Seal of England, and thus established <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> design of the Royal Arms of England. In 1177, his brother John had used a seal depicting a shield with two lions passant guardant, but when he succeeded his brother on the English throne he would adopt arms with three lions passant or on a field gules, and these were used as the Royal Arms (or King's Arms) by John (1199–1216), Henry III (1216–1272), Edward I (1272–1307), and Edward II (1307–1327).|$|E
