But mainly it's just the play calling, it's a lot longer than what it was in college, but all-in-all it's just learning a whole new terminology, some things are similar, but it's the words that they use are different. So it's all about adjustment. A lot of intelligence out there, they don't make mistakes. They are pretty mature on what they are doing.

[...] Pete Davison of MoeGamer noted how some {{characters in}} the game ridicule or parody real-life themes. For example, the corgis have prejudiced, [...] "even racist" [...] tendencies, with the [...] "disagreements between the different breeds of corgis who work at the company, and seeming resentment between some of the corgis and what they see as other types of dogs trying to take their jobs away from them" [...] mirroring real-life discrimination between humans; Betty, meanwhile, has irrational and illogical resentment of human enhancement. Davison praised these characterizations as laying bare the [...] "sheer ridiculousness of irrational prejudice." [...] There are at least seven different endings in VA-11 HALL-A depending on how well the player gets to know the characters. To obtain these special endings for certain characters, the player must get that character's order right every time throughout the game's story. Eventually, the player gets to know a character well enough that <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> they wish to drink in an exact moment, which leads to a [...] "very personal experience" [...] between the player and character.|$|E

Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth drove many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: [...] "I'll never believe {{that a man who}} understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony.

2500|$|Dasein is a German {{word and}} is {{sometimes}} translated as [...] "being-there" [...] or [...] "being-here" [...] (da combines in its meaning [...] "here" [...] and [...] "there", excluding the spatial-relational distinction {{made by the}} English words; Sein is the infinitive, [...] "to be"). It is the German form of the existential expletive, which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after Nietzsche, used the word, but as a gerund synonym for [...] "human being" [...] or [...] "human entity." [...] A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, in a familiar world, and in a mood. Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger {{does not want to}} get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as [...] "person," [...] "consciousness," [...] "soul," [...] or [...] "spirit," [...] so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of [...] "mineness," [...] or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> things are and that they are e.g. [...] "My dog is brown" [...] or [...] "Today is Sunday." [...] Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities as entities, helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of [...] "Dasein." ...|$|E
