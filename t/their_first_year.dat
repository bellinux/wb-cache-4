5|$|Baltimore was far {{and away}} the most {{successful}} of any American CFL team on the field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year).</b> Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E

Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E

5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings {{survived to}} <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities {{are due to}} nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive, childhood-onset disorder {{in which the}} body fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa {{and other forms of}} nerve dysfunction. It was first noted by the North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|Of eggs laid, 65–93% hatch successfully, and 75–92% of {{the chicks}} {{go on to}} fledge. The {{productivity}} (young fledged per nest) varies with location, level of predation and quality of habitat, but the national figure for the UK was 2.5. The adult annual survival rate is 43% (males 46%, females 29%), and 36% of juveniles live through <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> The typical life expectancy is two years, but the record is 13years and 10months for a bird in the Czech Republic.|$|E
