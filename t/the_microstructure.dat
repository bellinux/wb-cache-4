5|$|In {{the upper}} incisors, the chewing edges are located behind the {{vertical}} {{plane of the}} incisors; thus, they are opisthodont. <b>The</b> <b>microstructure</b> of the enamel of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of Hunter-Schreger bands, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism), as in all myomorph rodents. The PE consists of radial enamel, with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the dentine. <b>The</b> <b>microstructure</b> {{is similar to that}} of Holochilus brasiliensis and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{many other}} moths, the colour of C. rhipheuss wings {{does not come from}} pigments. The colour {{originates}} from coherent scattering and interference of light by <b>the</b> <b>microstructure</b> of the ribbon-like scales covering the moth's wings. These structural characteristics make this species and its Neotropical relative Urania common subjects of research in optical science.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through <b>the</b> <b>microstructure</b> of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Abrasive wear {{mechanism}} in HVOF sprayed near-nano and microstructured WC- 17 wt. %Co coatings was studied. The crack propagation mechanism {{shows that it}} propagates only through cobalt matrix {{in the case of}} near-nanostructured coatings while both trans-granular and intergranular crack propagation was observed in <b>the</b> <b>microstructured</b> coatings. SEM images show a relatively ductile failure {{mechanism in}} the near-nanostructured coating, while a brittle failure mechanism dominated in <b>the</b> <b>microstructured</b> coating. AFM images show that the worn surface is smooth in near-nanostructured coatings with an average roughness value of 19 nm, while the roughness on <b>the</b> <b>microstructured</b> coating worn surface was recorded at 83 nm. Further, the wear debris formed on the near-nanostructured coated surface was mostly spherical and finer, whereas this was irregular and coarser in <b>the</b> <b>microstructured</b> counterpart. <b>The</b> wear behaviour suggested a lower wear rate in the near-nanostructured coatings than <b>the</b> <b>microstructured</b> coating. This was further confirmed by abrasive wear tests results...|$|R

40|$|Two {{forms of}} microstructures in {{different}} types of asphaltenes and asphalt binder samples were discovered by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The first type of <b>the</b> <b>microstructures</b> is needle-shaped with a crystalline structure, while the second type is plate-shaped without a regular pattern. The size of <b>the</b> <b>microstructures</b> ranges from a few nanometers to several micrometers. <b>The</b> <b>microstructures</b> are more prevalent in field-aged asphalt binder and asphaltenes samples than those in nonaged ones. Experimental results indicate that both forms of microstructures are not made of wax, but asphaltenes molecules. The two forms of asphaltenes microstructures differ in morphology, microscopic structure, chemical composition, and resistance to electron radiation damage, indicating that they are formed by different mechanisms and have different physicochemical properties. Both types of microstructures also show thermal stability at elevated temperatures. The prevalence, size, and shape of <b>the</b> <b>microstructures</b> in field-aged asphalt binder may impart significant impacts on binder engineering properties in pavement use {{as well as its}} behaviors in recycling or rejuvenation.

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine <b>the</b> <b>microstructure</b> of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E

In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell and Esther A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that <b>the</b> <b>microstructure</b> of the trama and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it was moved to the genus Xerocomellus.|$|E

40|$|Enhancing the {{hydrophobicity}} {{of organic}} coatings retards their interaction {{with water and}} often leads to better protectiveness over metal corrosion. In this study, a soft lithography method was used to prepare epoxy coatings which showed surface microstructures in high replication to sandpapers. <b>The</b> effect of <b>microstructures</b> on coating’s hydrophobicity and barrier property was investigated. Compared to flat coatings, <b>the</b> <b>microstructured</b> coatings showed much higher water contact angles, which further increased with finer sandpapers. Determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the flat coating exhibited a higher anticorrosive performance than <b>the</b> <b>microstructured</b> coatings. With <b>the</b> use of finer sandpaper, the groove size of <b>the</b> corresponding <b>microstructured</b> coating was reduced. And a lower anticorrosive performance was observed since more defects might be formed in a given area of coating during the imprinting process. As the groove size of the coatings was further decreased to 5. 7 [*]µm, <b>the</b> <b>microstructures</b> became too small for water to easily penetrate through. Therefore, trapped air acted as an additional barrier and contributed to an increased anticorrosive performance compared to other microstructured coatings...|$|R
