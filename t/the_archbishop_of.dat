The unusual situation of having two archbishops {{at the top of}} Church hierarchy suggests that Northern England was seen as a sui generis. Likewise, with the exception of parts of the Diocese of Shrewsbury and Diocese of Nottingham, the North is covered in Roman Catholic Church administration by the Province of Liverpool, represented by <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> Toledo, Raymund, did attend. King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend. King Stephen of England refused permission {{for any of the}} English bishops to attend, except for the bishops of Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to attend the council.|$|E
5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> Cologne and <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with the problem}} and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E

5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council decided that <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury was the superior of <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> York and further ruled that York had no rights {{south of the}} Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics {{were taken from the}} province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving <b>the</b> <b>Archbishop</b> <b>of</b> suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England– such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E

5|$|Walter held a legateship from Pope Celestine III from 1195 to 1198, {{which enabled}} him to act with the pope's {{delegated}} authority within the English Church.

At the monastic cathedral of Worcester, he disciplined the monks between the death of Henry de Sully and the election of John of Coutances, as was his right as <b>the</b> <b>archbishop</b> <b>of</b> the province.
