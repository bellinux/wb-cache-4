50|$|Adding more {{controversy}} to the omega-6 fat {{issue is}} that the dietary requirement for linoleic acid has been questioned, because of a significant methodology error proposed by University of Toronto scientist Stephen Cunnane. Cunnane proposed that the seminal research {{used to determine the}} dietary requirement for linoleic acid was based on feeding animals linoleic acid-deficient diets, which were simultaneously deficient in omega-3 fats. <b>The</b> omega-3 <b>deficiency</b> was not taken into account. The omega-6 oils added back systematically <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> also contained trace amounts of omega-3 fats. Therefore, the researchers were inadvertently <b>correcting</b> <b>the</b> omega-3 <b>deficiency</b> as well. Ultimately, it took more oil <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> both deficiencies. According to Cunnane, this error overestimates linoleic acid requirements by 5 to 15 times.|$|R

The auditors` report on SEFPP`s internal control structure disclosed no new reportable conditions directed to the Southeastern Power Administration. However, the report did disclose a reportable condition directed to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps).

40|$|Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water {{splitting}} promises {{a solution to}} the problem of large-scale solar energy storage. However, its development has been impeded by the poor performance of photoanodes, particularly in their capability for photovoltage generation. Many examples employing photovoltaic modules <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> for unassisted solar {{water splitting}} have been reported to-date. Here we show that, by using the prototypical photoanode material of haematite as a study tool, structural disorders on or near the surfaces are important causes of the low photovoltages. We develop a facile re-growth strategy to reduce surface disorders and as a consequence, a turn-on voltage of 0. 45 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) is achieved. This result permits us to construct a photoelectrochemical device with a haematite photoanode and Si photocathode to split water at an overall efficiency of 0. 91 %, with NiFeOx and TiO 2 /Pt overlayers, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{problems}} had already existed in some form during the 1970s, and the government had introduced several measures intended <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Laws introduced in 1971 (which {{went into effect in}} 1975) had granted limited powers and a degree of decentralization to the intermediate level of administration, positioned between ministries and production enterprises. The intermediate level consisted of associations of industrial enterprises in the same or closely related branches, resembling trusts. The intent was to reduce overhead expenditures, such as planning and research, while promoting innovation and technological development. Changes also were introduced in the wage and price systems in an attempt to improve efficiency. Despite these measures, there was reason for continuing dissatisfaction in the 1980s.|$|E

Based on these trials, Spalding determined that Halley's design had weaknesses that added unnecessary risk to the divers. <b>To</b> <b>correct</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> Spalding added a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of ropes for signalling the surface crew. The redesigned diving bell weighed 200 lb and could accommodate two divers. Spalding also added ropes inside in the bell as seats and thick glass windows to admit light.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the past}} decade, major {{advances}} have reported {{the importance of}} the vitamin D on the bone metabolism, and recent studies have suggested the potential non skeletal effects of the vitamin D. Adequate vitamin D contributes {{to reduce the risk of}} non vertebral fractures, improves the neuromuscular function and reduces the risk of falls when serum 25 OHD level are greater than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). A possible role of vitamin D has been implicated in the reduction of mortality, of the non-skin cancers, of the risk of infections, of inflammatory diseases, of cardiovascular diseases and maybe osteoarthritis. However the current level of evidence for associations is weaker than for skeletal effects. Serum 25 OHD level is influenced by several factors (cutaneous vitamin D production, fat mass, dietary sources, UV-B exposure, latitude, season [...] .), and the measurement of the serum 25 OHD level is the only way to determine the vitamin D status.

Base pressures were measured on a classic cone ogive cylinder body as affected by the coaxial, high temperature exhaust plumes of a variety of solid propellant rockets. Valid data were obtained at supersonic freestream conditions but not at transonic. Pressure data related to lateral (separation) jets at M infinity = 4. 5, for multiple clustered nozzles canted to the freestream and operating at high dynamic pressure ratios.
