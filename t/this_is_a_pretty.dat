500|$|Before {{leaving town}} after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln {{to press the}} South hard militarily, though the war was ending.

[...] We must take care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.|$|E

[...] Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that, [...] "There's {{a healthy dose of}} nostalgia involved in watching these videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular. [...] The video quality is a mixed bag. Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips, which were photographed on much more primitive equipment. [...] All things considered, especially when viewed on a Blu-ray player and hi-def TV, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> rough looking set. Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness." [...] Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented, [...] "Celebration is a journey [...] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution. [...] The videos parallel this transformation from her innocent cavorting on a Venetian gondola for 'Like a Virgin' to the determinedly X-rated couplings of 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', both of which were banned. Monica Herrera from Billboard was not impressed with the collection and was disappointed with the [...] "dull quality of the videos. The collection is a probable shame in Madonna's catalogue, but a great one for her fans." [...] Bönz Malone from Spin said, [...] "Celebration: The Video Collection is a reminder that Madonna is, and always will be, a true video artist.

2500|$|In {{defining}} conservatism, Reagan said: [...] "If you {{analyze it}} I believe {{the very heart}} and soul of conservatism is libertarianism. I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals—if we were back {{in the days of the}} Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> general description also of what libertarianism is." [...] Reagan's views on government were influenced by Thomas Jefferson, especially his hostility to strong central governments. [...] "We're still Jefferson's children," [...] he declared in 1987. He also stated, [...] "Freedom is not created by Government, nor is it a gift from those in political power. It is, in fact, secured, more than anything else, by limitations placed on those in Government". Likewise he greatly admired and often quoted Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
2500|$|The pair bottled {{their first}} vintage Cabernet Sauvignon in 1972, aging the {{wine in the}} old Keig Dairy barn on the {{original}} plot of land Duncan purchased. They {{made the decision to}} produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world, to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels. Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, [...] "it was kind of a reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it was hard to do them all right, {{and it was kind of}} in keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention to that. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> common concept in France." [...] According to noted wine critic Robert Parker, Meyer always believed in harvesting ripe, physiologically mature fruit. In answer to the question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much as I like tough steak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vince Aletti from Rolling Stone {{also gave}} an {{unfavorable}} review, stating [...] "the formula is more rigorously locked in than before, {{and the range}} so tightly circumscribed that Houston's potential seems to have shrunk rather than expanded" [...] and the record is [...] "smug, repressive and ridiculously safe." [...] Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", calling it [...] "How Will I Know II", spoken at Hollywood's blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for Los Angeles Times, regarded the album as [...] "another commercial blockbuster", writing that the record is [...] "a series of highly accessible selections that will work {{on a variety of}} radio formats." [...] However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that Whitney did precious little to define the singer's vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn't assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of The Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: [...] "Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice takes us to places we know and to places we might want to forget and to places we dream about." [...] But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting [...] "There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring." [...] St. Petersburg Times showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating [...] " [...] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it's easy to be cynical about. But as products go, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good one." [...] They also praised her vocals as follows: [...] "Houston's voice sounds good, real good. [...] She's firmer, more confident." ...|$|E

[...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "overall, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> drab episode" [...] and added that [...] "it had some moments, such as the videogame boxing matches between Homer and Bart, but Lisa lacked the strength at this point to carry an entire show." ...|$|R

The idea of tossing Roger {{into the middle of}} a Banana republic and making him the dictator was inspired, especially as his personal obsessions somehow made him even more of a power-mad ruler than the old guy. American Dad’s political satire is always as broad and non-specific as possible, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> amusing take on the U.S.’ relations with Latin American countries as well, and the attempts to tie everything in to some sort of personal story involving the characters - specifically Roger’s desire to have Stan be his best friend and go pants shopping with him - worked better than it sometimes does." [...] He also gave the subplot of the episode a positive review, going on to write, [...] "The plot where Steve and Snot competed to see who could get whose mom to fondle whom in the most egregious fashion <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little overly broad, to be honest, but enough of the lines were amusing that the plot worked almost in spite of itself." [...] In conclusion of his review, VanDerWerff would write, [...] "American Dad sometimes wins the animation week by default, but <b>this</b> episode <b>was</b> actually and genuinely a fun piece of television."
