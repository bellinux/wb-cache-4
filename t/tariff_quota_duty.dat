40|$|Contact {{for this}} paper: Dr. Karl Meilke, Department of Agricultural Economics and Business, Guelph, Ontario N 1 G 2 W 1, Canada. The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture.

Analysts use such measures as arithmetic or trade-weighted average tariffs, Non-Tariff Barrier (NTB) coverage ratios and measures of tariff dispersion. All such measures are without theoretical foundation. In this paper we develop and characterise a theoretically-based index number of trade policy which is appropriate to trade negotiations. We characterize an index of trade policy restrictiveness defined as the uniform tariff equivalent which maintains the same volume of trade as a given set of <b>tariffs,</b> <b>quotas,</b> and domestic taxes and subsidies. We relate this volume-equivalent index to the Trade Restrictiveness Index, a welfare-equivalent measure, and relate changes in both indexes to changes in the generalised mean and variance of the tariff schedule. Applications to international cross-section and time-series comparisons of trade policy show that the new index frequently gives a very different picture than do standard indexes.

40|$|The use of tariff-rate quotas as a {{protectionist}} device has not {{yet been}} quite well understood. There is a widespread understanding that the offer of an additional <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> will generate a growth in the volume exported equivalent to the extra amount yielded. However, this may not happen, due to the characteristics of the tariff-quota system. Given the demand curve for a certain product, only one of the three components of the tariff-quota mechanism is determinant in restraining imports: the volume of the quota, the in-quota or the extra-quota. In addition, the estimate of gains in the value exported must include the increase in the ?quota-rent? allowed by the additional quota. This paper aims to point out the importance of an accurate assessment of the effects of additional <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> for some Brazilian agricultural exports. The study focuses on the case of the offer made by the European Union in the negotiations for a Mercosur-EU free trade agreement. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier <b>tariff</b> rate import <b>quota</b> system. Although Taiwan maintained land set-asides and domestic support prices for producer sales to the State Trading Enterprise, the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, land set-aside and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and land set-aside improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments. But the policy regime of the <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> (the in-quota <b>tariff</b> versus the out-of-quota <b>tariff</b> versus the <b>quota)</b> and hence social welfare is sensitive to changes in both domestic policy instruments and market structure. <b>tariff</b> rate <b>quota,</b> strategic alliance, domestic support, market structure, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|R

40|$|In the {{negotiations}} on {{agriculture in the}} World Trade Organization, it was asserted that an importing state trading enterprise affects the domestic market but not the international market. This claim is investigated through specifying a model of intermediaries in international trade. There {{are two kinds of}} intermediaries: first, a state trading enterprise; and second, an n-firm Cournot oligopsony/oligopoly that acts as the counterfactual. Using Japanese market price and quantity data for rice, and elasticity parameters drawn from the literature, the equations of the model are calibrated to these data and parameters. The resulting equations then permit the calculation of the tariff equivalence of the state trading enterprise under different assumptions about market structure, as well as the welfare effects associated with them. The equations are re-specified to model the existing import regime for rice, which is a <b>tariff</b> <b>quota.</b> The conclusions are: first, that, compared with the counterfactual, an importing state trading enterprise acts like a tariff by restricting imports; and second, the current import regime of a <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> causes a welfare loss compared with the counterfactual...|$|R
