5|$|In western Madagascar, {{sympatric}} ring-tailed lemurs and red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) {{have been}} studied together. Little interaction takes place between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species.</b> While the diets of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> overlap, they eat in different proportions since the ring-tailed lemur has a more varied diet and spends {{more time on the}} ground.|$|E
5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, and indeed <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> were {{roughly the same}} size. A review of their morphology and habitat, however, suggested a closer relationship to the modern pygmy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living forms, as well as elephant birds and Malagasy hippopotamuses, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and mongooses found in the same areas, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> may have been able to occur together.|$|E
40|$|The global {{dynamics}} of discrete competitive model of Lotka-Volterra type with <b>two</b> <b>species</b> is considered.

We prove that the system can also be globally asymptotically stable when the intrinsic growth rates of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> competitive <b>species</b> are greater than 1 and globally attractive when the intrinsic growth rates of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> competitive <b>species</b> are greater than 1 + ln 2...|$|R

5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary. The most complete account {{is that of}} Arnold Jacobi (1895) on specimens from Great Natuna (Natuna Islands) and Djemadja (Anamba Islands). Unfortunately, although {{it is clear that}} anatomical differences exist in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> Jacobi dissected, unfortunately we do not know which forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper he referred to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus. However, that is not possible, because in reality Amphidromus chloris is a species found only in the Philippine Islands, and the interruptus phase of A. perversus is not present in the Natuna Islands.|$|E

5|$|Sphecius grandis can be {{distinguished}} from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral tergites.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> of Seorsumuscardinus {{are known}} from {{isolated}} teeth, which {{show that they}} were medium-sized dormice with flat teeth. The teeth are all characterized by long transverse crests coupled with shorter ones. One of these crests, the anterotropid, distinguishes <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species,</b> as it {{is present in the}} lower molars of S.alpinus, but not in those of S.bolligeri. Another crest, the centroloph, reaches the outer margin of the first upper molar in S.bolligeri, but not in S.alpinus. Seorsumuscardinus may be related to Muscardinus, the genus of the living hazel dormouse, which appears at about the same time, and the older Glirudinus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> of Voalavo {{are only}} subtly {{different}} in morphology. With a body mass of , the eastern voalavo {{is a small}} rodent.

5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and colleagues in 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close to when the Isthmus of Panama first began to form.

5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2000 {{found that the}} genetic {{distance}} between jackdaws {{and the other members}} of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus, created by Johann Kaup in 1829, in her Birds of South Asia (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters. A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related Daurian jackdaw (C.dauuricus) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core Corvus clade. The names Coloeusmonedula and Coloeusdauuricus have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the Altai Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>species</b> from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.|$|E
