In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E

5|$|Athletes {{performances}} are timed or measured at virtually all {{track and field}} competitions.

The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, JAL debuted a Boeing777–300 (JA8941) with {{a special}} Oneworld livery to promote the airlines's entry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> airline alliance.

In 2008, JAL repainted a single Boeing 777–200 to have a green rather than red arc on its tail, along with a green origami airplane on the fuselage, and named it the Eco Jet, to highlight the company's efforts to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} commercial aviation. In 2009, JAL repainted JA8941 again, as well as a JTA 737-400 (JA8933) to promote Kobukuro and their new album Calling as well as a live concert tour in Okinawa and around Japan. This livery was released officially on 30 July 2009. It has since then been replaced {{with a special}} Doraemon livery.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales for the type. British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E

The first 1,000 fans who would drop off a minimum of three non-perishable food items would receive an autographed photo of Knowles and a raffle ticket for a chance to have an upgraded seat.

5|$|Minneapolis lies on both {{banks of}} the Mississippi River, {{just north of the}} river's {{confluence}} with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls, many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle, with Minneapolis proper containing America's fifth-highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies. As an integral link <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> economy, Minneapolis is categorized as a global city.|$|E
5|$|Netball is an Olympic {{recognised}} sport, {{a status}} attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period of lobbying.

Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of funds that the global netball community {{had not been able}} to access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, as of 2008, Japan {{still was}} Germany's second largest trading partner in Asia after China. In 2006, German imports from Japan totaled €15.6billion and German exports to Japan €14.2billion (15.4% and 9% {{more than the}} {{previous}} year, respectively). In 2008, however, Japanese exports and imports {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after growing by 5.8% in 2007 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> financial crisis. Bilateral trade between Germany and Japan also shrank in 2008, with imports from Japan having dropped by 6.6% and German exports to Japan having declined by 5.5%. Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal trading partner in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both exports and imports is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E

5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were replicated in an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> financial crisis of 2008–2009.|$|E

5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E

Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West Nile Virus may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E
