25|$|Amtrak {{commenced}} {{operations in}} 1971 with $40million in direct federal aid, $100million in federally insured loans, and a somewhat larger private contribution. Officials expected that Amtrak would break even by 1974, but <b>those</b> <b>expectations</b> proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of $1.25billion.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress continued the reductionist trend even while Amtrak expenses held steady or rose. Amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs, and by 1995 Amtrak {{was on the brink}} of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts. In response, in 1997 Congress authorized $5.2billion for Amtrak over the next five years – largely to complete the Acela capital project – on the condition that Amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation. While Amtrak made financial improvements during this period, it did not achieve self-sufficiency.|$|E
25|$|According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer {{the biggest}} primary {{impact of the}} New Deal {{on the economy and}} the key to {{recovery}} and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive just in March 1933 when Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933 people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With <b>those</b> <b>expectations,</b> interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free-fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} Japanese voters became happy and/or unhappy {{due to the}} results of the General Election in 2009.

However, happiness returned to the previous level in one or two days, implying people adapted to the news very quickly. Dividing those who support the policies of DPJ into two groups, those who expect material benefits from the victory of DPJ and those who do not, we demonstrated that the reason why the supporters of the winner (DPJ) felt happy was not because they obtained material benefits from the change of government. We also found that the happiness level of <b>those</b> whose <b>expectation</b> of the election results were realized did not change, while that of <b>those</b> whose <b>expectation</b> differed from the reality changed substantially.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941, shattered <b>those</b> <b>expectations</b> and plunged a not fully prepared United States into the war. At the beginning of 1942, two armored divisions were operational and three were in training; the 6th Armored Division was activated in February, followed by the 7th Armored Division in March. McNair recommended that one division in five be an armored division; [...] that meant up to fifty armored divisions by the end of 1943. Increased pressure was on Devers, promoted to lieutenant general (equal in rank to McNair) on 6 September 1942, to push more armored units through the pipeline even faster. Training was sometimes neglected because of the pressing need to get units ready for overseas deployment. Initially the Armored Force trained all the components of the armored division, but after March 1942 it became restricted to tank personnel, with other personnel coming from their own branch training centers. Devers sent Patton, now commander of I Armored Corps, to set up the Desert Training Center (DTC) in the California-Arizona Mojave Desert, where soldiers could train for desert warfare. By the time it closed in 1944, 20 infantry and armored divisions had trained there, although none fought in the desert, and five of them were sent to the Pacific.|$|E
