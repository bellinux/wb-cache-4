Chakotay mentions that he has mastered a skill of his native people called [...] "lucid dreaming." [...] Before entering a dream state, Chakotay provides himself with a <b>trigger</b> <b>image,</b> Earth's Moon that will remind him that he is still dreaming and {{can use it to}} restore himself to a conscious state. Suddenly he is asleep and in his dream, he is holding a spear and is deer hunting through the corridors of Voyager. When the deer enters the mess hall, he sees the full moon outside the window and realizes he's dreaming. A few seconds later, he sees the deer again but it transforms into the alien. The two men fight but Chakotay manages to subdue the alien who expresses surprise that Chakotay can control his dream. Chakotay then forces the alien to tell him how the other crew members can wake up. The alien tells him that once they passed their space, they will awake. Chakotay taps his hand three times and is instantly awake in sickbay.|$|E

40|$|Images from 7 {{patients}} {{were used to}} compare image quality {{in the terms of}} ghosting, sharpness and signal-to-noise ratio. The image quality were superior in the respiratory <b>triggered</b> <b>images,</b> less ghosting, higher sharpness and a significant higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to the free breathing images.

The simplified model relative enhanced diffusion (RED) was used in the data analysis. Based on this single patient the RED model seems promising. Based on the work present in this thesis it was concluded that the respiratory triggered protocol, due to the highest image quality, should be the base for further development of a new diffusion weighted protocol for pancreas.

40|$|Compressed sensing {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (CSMRI) employs image sparsity to reconstruct MR images from incoherently undersampled K-space data. Existing CSMRI approaches have exploited analysis transform, synthesis dictionary, and their variants to <b>trigger</b> <b>image</b> sparsity. Nevertheless, the accuracy, efficiency, or acceleration rate of existing CSMRI methods can still be improved due to either lack of adaptability, high complexity of the training, or insufficient sparsity promotion. To properly balance the three factors, this paper proposes a two-layer tight frame sparsifying (TRIMS) model for CSMRI by sparsifying the image with {{a product of a}} fixed tight frame and an adaptively learned tight frame. The two-layer sparsifying and adaptive learning nature of TRIMS has enabled accurate MR reconstruction from highly undersampled data with efficiency. To solve the reconstruction problem, a three-level Bregman numerical algorithm is developed. The proposed approach has been compared to three state-of-the-art methods over scanned physical phantom and in vivo MR datasets and encouraging performances have been achieved...|$|E

40|$|Fetal cardiac {{function}} is increasingly {{recognized as a}} marker of disease severity and prognosis in selected fetal conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{has been used in}} experimental (animal) fetal cardiology but the lack of a noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) to <b>trigger</b> <b>image</b> acquisition remains a major limiting factor precluding its application in humans. Fetal medicine specialists are therefore limited to ultrasound to evaluate human fetal cardiac function. In this review, we aim to provide a complete overview of the different ultrasound techniques {{that can be used for}} fetal cardiac function assessment and we discuss their (theoretical) strengths and shortcomings. Conventional methods include M-mode assessment of ventricular contractility and Doppler assessment of the precordial veins and cardiac output (CO). More recent techniques such as the measurement of the myocardial performance index (MPI), myocardial motion analysis with tissue Doppler, speckle tracking and three-dimensional (3 D) ultrasound techniques are also discussed.

40|$|Pre-clinical cardiac imaging {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} non-invasive techniques widely used nowadays for studying the electrophysiology and hemodynamic behaviour of the heart using small animals’ models. Despite the great potential it offers for clinical applications in humans, the introduction of movement artefacts and blurring in the images due to the inherent blood flow and respiration among others, reduces significantly the quality of imaging leading to mistakes in results interpretation. A solution to this problem is the synchronization of the electrocardiogram with the imaging machine in a process called gated imaging to <b>trigger</b> <b>image</b> acquisition at specific moments of the cardiac cycle. In this manner, the principal objective of the presented Bachelor Thesis was to design, develop, program and test a small size ECG monitor for small animal gated imaging. The main functions of this device are monitoring the cardiac activity at the same time a TTL pulse is activated in real-time for gating synchronization with the imaging machine. A microcontroller, an analog-to-digital converter and a touch screen were connected together to form a small ECG device that is able to record bioelectrical signals of the heart, to process them and display the electrocardiogram on the screen and generate a TTL pulse for gated imaging. Communication in between the different modules was enabled by SPI protocol implementation. The evaluation of the ECG prototype was performed first in the laboratory with an ECG simulator showing good performance to be later tried in small animals. On the whole the results were satisfactory except from some issues in TTL pulse activation that might need further improvements to enhance gated imaging implementation. This project and the future improved versions of this ECG device, will have a big scientific and social impact. This small size ECG monitor will not only offer an easy to use portable monitoring device for pre-clinical research but also a powerful tool for gated imaging that will be essential for the development of revolutionary drugs to treat heart diseases.

40|$|Four {{dimensional}} (4 D) {{computed tomography}} (CT) image sorting {{is currently a}} retrospective procedure. Mismatches in displacement and∕or phase of a patient’s respiratory signal, corresponding with two dimensional images taken at subsequent couch positions, become visible as artifacts in reconstructed 4 D CT images. These artifacts appear as undefined or irregular boundaries in the 4 D CT images and cause systematic errors in patient contouring and dose calculations. In addition, the substantially higher dose required for 4 D CT, compared with 3 D CT, is of concern. To minimize these problems, we developed a prospective respiratory displacement and velocity based cine 4 D CT (PDV CT) method to <b>trigger</b> <b>image</b> acquisition if the displacement and velocity of the respiratory signal occurred within predetermined tolerances simultaneously. The use of velocity avoids real-time phase estimation. Real-time image acquisition ensures data sufficiency, while avoiding the need for redundant data. This may potentially result in a lower dose to the patient. PDV CT was compared with retrospective 4 D CT acquisition methods, using respiratory signals of 24 lung cancer patients (103 sessions) under free breathing conditions. Image acquisition was simulated {{for each of these}} sessions from the respiratory signal. The root mean square (RMS) of differences between displacements and velocities of the respiratory signal corresponding to subsequent images was calculated in order to evaluate the image-sorting accuracy of each method. Patient dose reductions of 22 to 50 % were achieved during image acquisition depending on the model parameters chosen. The mean RMS differences over all sessions and image bins show that PDV CT produces similar results to retrospective displacement sorting overall, although improvements of the RMS difference up to 20 % were achieved depending on the model parameters chosen. Velocity RMS differences improved between 30 and 45 % when compared with retrospective phase sorting. The efficiency in acquisition compared with retrospective phase sorting varied from ∼ 10 % for displacement and velocity tolerances of 1 mm and 4 mm∕s, respectively, to 80 to 93 % for 4 mm and 4 mm∕s. The lower variation in the displacement and velocity of the respiratory signal in each image bin indicates that PDV CT could be a valuable tool for reducing artifacts in 4 D CT images and lowering patient dose, although the cost may be increased acquisition time...|$|E

This indicates that the presented solution could enable clinical applications of real-time MRI for the examination of arrhythmic cardiac motion in the future...|$|R
