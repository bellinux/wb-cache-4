40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaAs {{the flight}} test {{community}} {{moves into the}} 21 st century, the ever increasing demand for higher telemetry data rates {{and the need to}} transport additional data types is becoming the challenge of every flight test range. The evolution of the flight test range has grown from low telemetry data rates and a few 2400 baud tracking sources into high-speed telemetry, GPS based tracking, networking, digital video, and more. Recognizing the need to change the way data is managed has resulted in an effort to redefine the work centers at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB. The <b>Technical</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> (TCC) within the Ridley Mission Control Center at Edwards AFB is currently being relocated with the intent of achieving tomorrow’s vision, while supporting the missions of today. One major goal of this redefinition is the elimination of as much analog transmission equipment as possible in favor of digital transmission. The new digital range requires management of data and allocation of that management in different ways than the past. Moving to an all-digital range has advantages that are just now being realized. This paper outlines the current and future design, configuration, maintenance, and operation of the TCC and touches on how some of the other range functions are impacted. In addition, the challenges and benefits of implementing the next generation in range communications will be discussed...|$|E

The 267th Communications Squadron was the first Air National Guard unit to join the Air Force Space Surveillance Team with the acquisition of a Doppler Satellite Tracking System in December 1960.

In 1963, a new wing was added to the Wellesley Air National Guard Station to accommodate its growing mission and training requirements in support of tactical operations.|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the AN/MLQ-36, used by the Army and Marines, is a multifunction, open-architecture AN/MLQ-36A Mobile Electronic Warfare Support System Product Improvement Program, which is a total replacement of the electronics in the AN/MLQ-36. The MEWSS PIP provides the ability to detect and evaluate enemy communications emissions, detect and categorize enemy noncommunications emissions (i.e., battlefield radars), determine Lines-of-Bearing (LOBs), and degrade enemy tactical radio communications during amphibious assaults and subsequent operations ashore. When mission configured, and working cooperatively with other MEWSS PIP platforms, the common suite of equipment can also provide precision location of battlefield emitters. The system is designed to have an automated tasking and reporting data link to other MAGTF assets such as the AN/TSQ-130 <b>Technical</b> <b>Control</b> and Analysis <b>Center</b> (TCAC) PIP. The MEWSS PIP and future enhancements will provide the capability to exploit new and sophisticated enemy electronic emissions and conduct Electronic Attack (EA) in support of existing and planned national, theater, Fleet, and MAGTF SIGINT/EW operations.|$|R

The Group Headquarters, the 282 Combat Communications Squadron (CBCS), and the 283 CBCS were formerly Tactical Air Control units. The 263 CBCS {{was assigned to}} the Group in 1988. In 1993, the 118 CBCS {{was assigned to the}} Group Hqs. The 118th was a NATO Air Base Support (NABS) organization and recently converted to an Initial Beddown mission in NATO. Prior to the new Tactical Contingency Communications Equipment - Central Area (TCCE-CA) mission, the 282CBCS and 283 CBCS provided the entire USAF inventory of MRC-113 wideband radios and TSC-38B [...] high frequency radios. The MRC-113 was the largest and had the longest range and channel capacity of any USAF Tactical Wideband radio system. The TSC-38B provided secure record traffic and a telephone switch in addition to its HF radio capabilities. The 263 CBCS was part of the 251CCG from Springfield, Ohio and had the contingency squadron mission. They possessed a variety of analog communications equipment, including high frequency and line-of-sight radios, <b>technical</b> <b>control,</b> record communications <b>center,</b> tactical switchboards, and a Digital Subscriber Terminal. In 1985, the 281 CCG was selected as the USAF Component of the Tactical Contingency Communications Equipment - Central Area (TCCE-CA) in support of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM).|$|R
