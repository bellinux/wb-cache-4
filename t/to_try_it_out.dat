500|$|In junior high, Lautner—who was {{involved}} in karate, baseball and hip-hop dance—won the award for [...] "Best Smile" [...] and played in the school's Turkey Bowl American Football game. He went to public school in Valencia, California at Valencia High School until his sophomore year. Chaturantabut, who once portrayed the Blue Ranger in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, suggested to Lautner that he take up acting. For a few years, the Lautners flew from Michigan to Los Angeles for auditions when his talent agency called, and returned to Grand Rapids for school sometimes the same day. Lautner balanced karate and acting with being on the football and baseball teams at his school, and taking up jazz and hip-hop dance. After that became tiring, Lautner and his family {{decided to move to}} California for a month, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> before moving to Santa Clarita, California, permanently in 2002.|$|E

60|$|Now {{when the}} captains saw the answer {{of the great}} ones, {{and that they could}} not get a hearing from the old natives of the town, and that Mansoul was {{resolved}} to give the King's army battle, they prepared themselves to receive them, and <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> by the power of the arm. And, first, they made their force more formidable against Ear-gate; for they knew that, unless they could penetrate that, no good could be done upon the town. This done, they put the rest of their men in their places; after which, they gave out the word, which was, 'YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN.' Then they sounded the trumpet; then they in the town made them answer, with shout against shout, charge against charge, and so the battle began. Now they in the town had planted upon the tower over Ear-gate two great guns, the one called High-mind, and the other Heady. Unto these two guns they trusted much; they were cast in the castle by Diabolus' founder, whose name was Mr. Puff-up, and mischievous pieces they were. But so vigilant and watchful, when the captains saw them, were they, that though sometimes their shot would go by their ears with a whiz, yet they did them no harm. By these two guns the townsfolk made no question but greatly to annoy the camp of Shaddai, and well enough to secure the gate; but they had not much cause to boast of what execution they did, as by what follows will be gathered.|$|E
