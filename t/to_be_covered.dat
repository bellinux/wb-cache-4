5|$|In 2002, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet Woollard {{called for}} the statue's {{genitalia}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again {{called for the}} statue's groin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered,</b> {{on the grounds that}} such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is {{the creation of a new}} statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E
5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{part of the}} {{constellation}} {{was the subject of}} a two-week observation program by the Hubble Space Telescope, which resulted in the Hubble Deep Field South. The potential area <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> needed to be at the poles of the telescope's orbit for continuous observing, with the final choice resting upon the discovery of a quasar, QSO J2233-606, in the field.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|Air Greenland also {{performs}} charter flights within Europe {{on behalf}} of European travel agencies using its Airbus A330. In 2015, the decision voted by Greenland's governments to extend the runways of Nuuk and Ilulissat airports directly threatened the purpose of Air Greenland's single widebody aircraft. The A330 was only used from Pituffik and Kangerlussuaq to Copenhagen Kastrup, but in January 2017, Air Greenland had announced more commercial routes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by the aircraft between Iceland and Greenland. In March 2017, Air Greenland also announced adding more flights to Kangerlussuaq.|$|E
5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E

5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts {{on the inside of}} her hull <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> with sheet iron to prevent them from breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the assault in Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred {{too late in the}} evening <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi– due to press censorship– was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and {{the front page of the}} 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E

5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the Dome of the Rock <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|The Diet of 1468 {{authorized}} Matthias to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax {{to finance the}} new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf {{that he would not}} demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine's eyre in a county, the cost of which were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty.|$|E

5|$|The bronze quoll (D. spartacus) is {{the only}} mammal found in the Trans Fly ecoregion, but not in {{northern}} Australia. It {{is found in the}} southern part of New Guinea south of the Fly River. Rising sea levels due to an increase in global temperature caused a land bridge that once connected Australia and New guinea <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> up with water. A 2007 study conducted by the University of New South Wales suggests the bronze quoll is closely related to the western quoll, their ancestors diverging with the separation of land masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the arcades of Freedom Square began in October 2010. Excavation {{works for the}} foundations of the Parliament House began soon after demolition was complete. In early 2011, the original plan was modified with the relocation of a staircase, the extension of one of the blocks, and changes {{in the design of the}} louvers on the facade. Construction started later that year, and the steel frame of the structure was complete by early 2012. At this point, it began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> in limestone which had been quarried in Gozo, and cut into specific shapes in Italy, before being sent back to Malta. Between 120 and 150 workers were on the construction site every day, and it cost more than €90 million to build.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E

5|$|The press had an {{aggressive}} {{coverage of the}} accident. Several major press organizations attended the memorial service, and newspapers published close-up pictures of crying next of kin on their front pages. The Norwegian Press Complaints Commission, a committee appointed by the newspapers themselves, acquitted Dagbladet after a complaint for their aggressive image use. However, the accident coverage started an internal debate among journalists about their coverage of major accidents. The conclusion was that private sorrow was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> {{in the media and}} since the media has had a strict self-enforcement of such a policy.|$|E
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered.</b> Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
