5|$|A {{prime example}} of Roman loss in battle was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were {{destroyed}} by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> Roman expansion into Germany. Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.|$|E
5|$|Burchard du Puiset (died 1196) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Norman clergyman and {{treasurer}} of the diocese of York. Either the nephew or son of Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, Burchard held a number of offices in the dioceses of York and Durham before being appointed treasurer by King Richard I of England in 1189. His appointment was opposed by the newly appointed Archbishop Geoffrey, {{which led to a}} long dispute between Geoffrey and Burchard that was not resolved until the mid 1190s. After the death of Hugh du Puiset, Burchard was a candidate for the Hugh's old bishopric, but lost out in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> another candidate. Burchard died in 1196.|$|E
5|$|Of the 158 {{people on}} board, 73 {{died as a}} result of the crash. The lead flight {{attendant}} was the only crew member to survive. Of the surviving passengers, 72 adults and children over three years old sustained serious injuries, while two sustained minor injuries. Of the 11 infants, two sustained minor injuries, eight were seriously injured, and one, Kenneth Fernando Martinez, the four-month-old son of Gloria L. Martinez, died. The surviving steward testified that there had been no communication from the cockpit as to the unfolding situation and, thus, no warning in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> assume brace positions. The NTSB report held that, had passengers been warned ahead of time to brace for impact, the severity of some injuries might have been avoided.|$|E

His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator.

Samuel Eto'o opened the scoring in the 10thminute, and Lionel Messi added another goal 20minutes from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> earn Barcelona a historic treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, a feat never before achieved by a Spanish club.

5|$|The {{long jump}} {{is one of}} the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>to</b> reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E
5|$|The thin corpus spongiosum of {{the penis}} {{runs along the}} {{underside}} of the penile shaft, enveloping the urethra, and expands at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> form the glans. It partially contributes to erection, which are primarily caused by the two corpora cavernosa that comprise the bulk of the shaft; like the female cavernosa, the male cavernosa soak up blood and become erect when sexually excited. The male corpora cavernosa taper off internally on reaching the spongiosum head. With regard to the Y-shape of the cavernosa– crown, body, and legs– the body accounts for much more of the structure in men, and the legs are stubbier; typically, the cavernosa are longer and thicker in males than in females.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material presented at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> explain material {{presented at the}} beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear narrative in chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous was not necessary for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach {{was typical of the}} era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.|$|E
5|$|To reach a {{complete}} peace Thurisind had first {{to deal with}} Ildigis who had found hospitality at Thurisind's court. Audoin demanded yet again to have him turned in, and Justinian joined in the request. Thurisind, despite his reluctance to resume the war with both Audoin and Justinian, {{did not want to}} openly breach the rules of hospitality and thus tried to evade the request by demanding in his turn to have Ostrogotha given to him; in <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>to</b> avoid both openly giving in {{and at the same time}} renewing the war, both kings murdered their respective guests but kept secret their involvement in the act.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> <b>To</b> the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead as a vehicle for a good story.|$|E

5|$|After {{his earlier}} crash Downie retired {{on the third}} lap with a broken wheel, while Thornycroft, who had also had first lap trouble, was forced to stop with a broken rear axle. Over the final two laps a number of cars ran out of fuel, and of the 42 {{starters}} only 18 completed the race. The first car to finish was the Rolls Royce of Percy Northey. He had started twenty minutes ahead of Napier's Arrol-Johnston so Napier had to finish within twenty minutes of Northey in order to win. He did so, passing the finish line eighteen minutes later, having run the fastest lap of the race at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> win by just over two minutes. Napier's time was 6 hours 9 minutes 14.6 seconds, followed by Northey in 6:11:23 and Norman Littlejohn in a French Vinot-Deguingand, in 6:14:32.4. The three drivers had been consistently the quickest throughout the race and were separated by just over five minutes. The next quickest driver was E. J. C. Roberts in {{the second of the}} Arrol-Johnstons, but he was over 25 minutes behind his victorious team-mate.|$|E
5|$|Fagan's {{retirement}} in May 1985 and Dalglish's subsequent promotion to player-manager meant {{that instead of}} gradually succeeding Dalglish as Liverpool's main striker Walsh instead {{had to contend with}} a rival for his position as the club's manager. He missed 1985–86 pre-season after undergoing a hernia operation. He returned to fitness against Oxford United on 14 September, but had a bitter argument with Dalglish at half-time which initially seemed to spell <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> his Liverpool career as he was placed on the transfer list. He returned to the first team though and was taken off the transfer list by his own request and soon entered a scoring streak, though his form was ended after he ruptured his ankle ligaments in a collision with Manchester United's Kevin Moran on 9 February. He returned to action six weeks later but continued to suffer with ankle trouble and was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season, ending the campaign with 18 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions throughout the campaign. His injury caused him to miss the 1986 FA Cup Final, though he secured a First Division winners medal as Liverpool won the league by a two-point margin over Everton. His contribution to the club's success was not forgotten as he was named in the First Division's PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Mark Lawrenson.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1979–80, under former {{player and}} new manager Billy McNeill, {{they reached the}} quarter-finals of the European Cup. Celtic were drawn against Real Madrid, and goals from George McCluskey and Johnny Doyle gave Celtic a 2–0 win in the first leg at Parkhead. Goalkeeper Peter Latchford had an {{excellent}} match, and in particular his saves from England striker Laurie Cunningham and Spanish star Santillana were crucial in helping Celtic keep a clean sheet. The return leg took place two weeks later at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in front of approximately 120,000 fans. Johnny Doyle missed an excellent chance to score early in the first half, and then just before half-time Santillana pulled a goal back for Real. Uli Stielike levelled the tie {{in the second half}} with a powerful volley past Latchford, before Juanito added a third near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> send Celtic out 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma State scored first, with a {{surprising}} 49yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 {{as if trying}} a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21–9 {{at the end of}} the firstquarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the secondquarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28–12 at halftime.

5|$|The Czech events {{weakened}} {{the position of}} the Habsburgs in Silesia, where there were large concentrations of ethnically Polish inhabitants, whose ties and interests at that time placed them within the Protestant camp. Numerous Polish Lutheran parishes, with schools and centers of cultural activity, had been established in the heavily Polish areas around Opole and Cieszyn in eastern Silesia, as well as in numerous cities and towns throughout the region and beyond, including Breslau (Wrocław) and Grünberg (Zielona Góra). The threat posed by a potentially resurgent Habsburg monarchy to the situation of Polish Silesians was keenly felt, and there were voices within King Sigismund's circle, including Stanisław Łubieński and Jerzy Zbaraski, who brought to his attention Poland's historic rights and options in the area. The King, an ardent Catholic, advised by many not to involve the Commonwealth on the Catholic-Habsburg side, decided in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> act in their support, but unofficially.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E
