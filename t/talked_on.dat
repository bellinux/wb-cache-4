In anticipation of this event, in August 1939 he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples; Churchill asked Wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which the latter agreed.|$|E

England established a trading relationship with Morocco in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, {{in spite of a}} Papal ban. In 1600, Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud, the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur, visited England as an ambassador to the court of Queen Elizabeth I, to negotiate an Anglo-Moroccan alliance against Spain.

He made friends with the press and radio, he {{went out of his}} way to be congenial and likable." [...] Bullock indicated that regardless of the tactics used, Nixon would likely have beaten the incumbent given the national Republican tide that swept the party into power in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1931.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} motor vehicle {{accidents}} that {{occur as a}} result of driving while <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices increases each year. Distracted driving is dangerous; however, policy researchers have not focused <b>on</b> adults who <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices as they drive children to and from daily events. This study focused on the experiences of soccer parents, an important focus because of soccer 2 ̆ 7 s year-long duration that requires a large amount of driving in addition to the other daily tasks of parenting. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to investigate the perceptions of parents of child soccer players regarding the motivations for and risks of <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices while driving. The theoretical framework for this phenomenological study was the self-determination theory. Data were collected by electronic surveys using a convenience sample of 10 couples and 4 single parents of children who play soccer for a team in a southern state. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method in which patterns were identified and coded into themes. The key findings were that the parents had different perceptions of the risks and motivations for <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices while driving. There were participants who viewed <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices as risky while others did not perceive <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices while driving as a risk. Recommendations include conducting further research on parents who drive children to and from soccer practices, while <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices, in order to gain better understanding of what motivates people to choose to <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices while driving. The implications for positive social change include informing policy makers about the importance of increasing awareness and educating the public about the risks of <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> mobile devices while driving...|$|R
