Negative net debt arises because tradeable claims cannot be issued against <b>transferable</b> human <b>capital.</b> Heterogeneity in capital structure occurs when firms have debt that is not fully collateralized.

This arises in economies where the average unemployment duration of low-skilled workers is not too much greater than that of the high-skilled.

40|$|Does {{technological}} change amount to accumulation of general, and so <b>transferable,</b> human <b>capital?</b> To approach this question I {{rely on a}} theoretical framework in which the "technology distance" between industries reduces inter-industry transferability of workers' skill. Empirically, I use US panel data on individual intra-industry and inter-industry mobility decisions between 1982 and 1990, a period of rapid {{technological change}} in all manufacturing sectors, to estimate a mixed logit econometric specification that does not rely on the IIA assumption. I find support to the main idea that technological innovation and diffusion have different effects on workers' industrial mobility patterns. "Knowledge spillovers", differently from "rent spillovers", indeed boost the chances of workers' inter-industry mobility. Surprisingly, this is more consistently so in low-tech industries than in high-tech industries. Consistently with the expectations developed in the theoretical framework, in low-tech industries skilled workers respond more sharply to technology diffusion than unskilled workers. 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the puzzle how employers {{that invest in}} general human capital can gain an information advantage {{with respect to the}} ability of their employees when training is certified by credible external institutions. We apply an established model from the employer-learning literature and distinguish between two ability dimensions: cognitive and work-related ability. We apply this model to the German apprenticeship system and show that cognitive ability certified by external institutions at that the end of apprenticeship training can be signalled to outside employers. Apprenticeship graduates however cannot signal their work-related ability - measured by a small voluntary bonus paid by the training employer - to the outside market. We therefore show that the information advantage on work-related ability explains that training employers can positively select the apprentices they retain. As a consequence, this information advantage induces employers to invest in certified and <b>transferable</b> human <b>capital...</b>|$|R

In this paper we analyze this sectoral mobility after graduation.

As a consequence, after graduation, these young workers might know that work in another sector would better fit their preferences although they are better equipped for work in their own sector. The empirical analysis reveals that, consistent with the predictions of this model, the probability of sectoral mobility increases the more graduates regret their educational choice and the higher the transferability of skills. When graduates leave, they take more training and face larger wage losses when the transferability is lower. Finally, we find evidence that pupils who face more uncertainty about their educational choice tend to choose fields of study with a high transferability of skills...|$|R
40|$|After {{graduation}} {{many students}} start working in sectors {{not related to}} their field of study or participate in training targeted at work in other sectors. In this article, we look at mobility immediately after graduation from the perspective that educational choices have been made when these pupils had little experience of the actual working life in these professions. We develop a model where students accumulate partially <b>transferable</b> human <b>capital</b> but also learn about their professional preferences at the university and during the first years in the labour market. As a consequence of this newly acquired insight, these young workers might realize that working in another occupational field would better fit their preferences, although they are better equipped to work in their own field.

40|$|How do firms {{benefit from}} {{employees}} with transferable skills? The prevailing {{view is that}} labor market frictions that impede employee mobility or strategies that constrain skill transferability are the primary instruments for firms to appropriate value from human capital. The empirical evidence, however, suggests that employees continue to be mobile, and firms pay premiums {{to attract and retain}} employees with transferable skills. To reconcile theory with data, we use data from the mutual-fund industry, where it is widely documented that active fund managers appropriate more value than they generate. We develop a theory of positive externalities stemming from <b>transferable</b> human <b>capital</b> that we argue accrue mostly to the firm, and provide evidence of such externalities in the mutual fund context. Empirically, we decompose the skills of mutual-fund managers into task- and firm-specific components, and argue that managers with taskspecific skills generate positive externalities at the firm level that are not reflected in their performance measured at the fund level. We advance and test empirical hypotheses on the existence of these positive unmeasured externalities by examining whether managers with task-specific skills {{are more likely to be}} associated with activities such as mentoring, increased risk taking, and generating spillovers at the firm level. Our results show that managers with task-specific skills are indeed associated with greater positive externalities, compared with managers with firm-specific skills.

40|$|Internationalisation is a {{dominant}} policy discourse {{in higher education}} today. It is invariably presented as an ideologically neutral, coherent, disembodied, knowledgedriven policy intervention - an unconditional good. Yet it is a complex assemblage of values linked not only to economic growth and prosperity, but also to global citizenship, transnational identity capital, social cohesion, intercultural competencies and soft power (Clifford and Montgomery 2014; De Wit et al. 2015; Kim 2017; Lomer 2016; Stier 2004). Mobility is {{the sine qua non}} of the global academy (Sheller 2014). International movements, flows and networks are perceived as valuable transnational and <b>transferable</b> identity <b>capital</b> and as counterpoints to intellectual parochialism. Fluidity metaphors abound as an antidote to stasis e. g. flows, flux and circulations (Urry 2007). For some, internationalisation is conceptually linked to the political economy of neoliberalism and the spatial extension of the market, risking commodification and commercialisation (Matus and Talburt 2009). Others raise questions about what/whose knowledge is circulating and whether internationalisation is a form of re-colonisation and convergence that seeks to homogenise higher education systems (Stromquist 2007). Internationalisation policies and practices, it seems, are complex entanglements of economic, political, social and affective domains. They are mechanisms for driving the global knowledge 2 economy and the fulfilment of personal aspirations (Hoffman 2009). Academic geographical mobility is often conflated with social mobility and career advancement (Leung 2017). However, Robertson (2010 : 646) suggested that ‘the romance of movement and mobility ought to be the first clue that this is something we ought to be particularly curious about. ...|$|R
40|$|Employer-funded {{investments}} in human capital {{are associated with}} risks for firms which are difficult to calculate and which result from the unsecured binding to the firm of the employees in question. From a theoretical point of view the employer-side funding of {{investments in}} general or <b>transferable</b> human <b>capital</b> can be a rational strategy of the employers if repayment clauses are used at the same time. This can be derived {{on the basis of}} a human capital theory approach which is augmented by risk and incentive aspects. A survey conducted among just under 330 firms in various sectors proves that repayment clauses are clearly preferred to employees sharing the costs. According to the results of the logistic regression models, the employer's investment risk plays a key role in this respect. Cost-sharing by the employees in the form of direct monetary integration or the use of leisure time are in some cases used complementary to repayment clauses at firm level. Furthermore great differences in use between the sectors become apparent. Repayment clauses are very common in the financial intermediation sector and in commerce. Future theoretical and empirical research work should take into account employment system effects and processes institutionalising certain personnel-policy practices more intensively than has been the case to date in order to be able to record in a more differentiated form the possible effects of the personnel-policy instruments in the particular concrete (personnel management and industry-specific) environment.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{significance of}} employers' collective action for economic performance is widely acknowledged, {{but has not}} been complemented with corresponding theory-guided research on the probability of collective action and the conditions for effective action. This thesis examines the nature of, the conditions for, {{and the consequences of}} employers' collective action on further training, a crucial component of a successful high-skill strategy for industries and nations. The study addresses three core issues of labour economics: transferability of training, skill shortages, and sharing of training costs between employer and employees. The enquiry builds on and adds to previous contributions that analyse transferable training as a collective good. It scrutinises the theoretical foundation and compares its implications with those of human capital theory. Finally, the empirical study of further education and training in four Norwegian industries is offered as a strategic test of these two alternative theories. The collective action perspective shares core assumptions of human capital theory, but integrates the possibility of collective action as a solution to some of the market failures associated with investment in <b>transferable</b> human <b>capital.</b> This alternative view also predicts in what labour market settings such action is likely to occur, building on Olson's work and theories of employers' collective action. The collective action perspective differs crucially from human capital theory by predicting that transferability is endogenous i. e. significantly shaped by employers' individual and collective action, and not simply by technology. Thus, 'endogenous transferability' is a principal link between the constitution of labour markets and employers' choice of training and skill supply strategies. The results confirm the prediction that transferability is 'endogenous'. Moreover, they suggest that employers' collective action is more likely to succeed in ensuring transferability and encouraging employee investment than is using sanctions against employers to promote employer-financed transferable training...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is explore an {{organizational}} design that allows firms to invest in <b>transferable</b> strategic human <b>capital.</b> Strategic human capital requires considerable investment in training costs, effective compensation, opportunities for professional development and expectancy of long employment relationship within a firm. A firm can undertake investment in strategic knowledge and workers can engage in learning only in these circumstances. However, there are a number of risks that are associated with investment in strategic human capital within a firm […]. Design/methodology/approach – This paper conceptualizes the use of alliance based on co-specialization as a strategy to optimize investment in strategic human capital resource […]. Findings – First, the paper reviews the theoretical literature on human capital as a strategic resource (Becker, 1962; Coff, 1997), its sourcing on internal and external labor markets and respective employment systems (Delery and Doty, 1996; Doeringer and Piore, 1971). Second, it focuses on the features of human capital resource (Barney, 1986; Chi, 1994; Doz and Hamel, 1998). Third, it conceptualizes the use of alliances based on co-specialization as organizational structures for investment in human capital across organizations and examines respective employment system and HR practices (Delery and Doty, 1996; Doeringer and Piore, 1971) […].

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays addressing the issues of labor mobility or human capital accumulation from different aspects. The first essay is titled as “Human Capital Accumulation and the Use of Non-compete Agreements. ” This essay analyzes under what conditions it is desirable for firms to use non-compete agreements (NCAs) by analyzing a model with non-contractible and partially <b>transferable</b> human <b>capital,</b> wage bargaining, and bilateral investment from both firms and works. Elaborating on the trade-off between mitigating the firm's and worker's under-investment problem, we show that firms will use NCAs {{if and only if}} the relative importance of firm's training when building up worker's overall human capital is sufficiently high. We also analyzed an extension of our model that incorporates unknown match quality and the measurement of worker's riskiness. The result suggests that it is more desirable to use NCAs for the high risky worker, which offers implication in the recruitment practice. The second essay is titled as “Asset Specificity, Human Capital Acquisition, and Labor Market Competition. ” This essay explores a new model of labor market competition that incorporates asset specificity, acquisition of firm-specific human capital, firm size, and labor mobility. Each firm's production efficiency is determined by the level of its managerial capability, and firm-specificity of asset and human capital in the model. Elaborating on the connection between labor mobility and the levels of firms' asset specificity and their employment sizes, we show that the importance of managerial capability and firm-specificity of asset systematically influence labor mobility, asset specificity, average firm size, and employment practices. The model's empirical implications are also discussed. The third essay is titled as “Taxation of Human Capital and Labor Income Inequality: The Role of Parental Transfer. ” This essay studies how labor income and bequest taxes affect labor income inequality. The data from 19 OECD countries between 1980 and 2008 show that the labor income taxation significantly increases income inequality measured by Gini coefficient, and the inequality effect of bequest taxation is ambiguous.
