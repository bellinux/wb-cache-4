40|$|A review {{describing}} the latest {{advances in the}} mesoscopic and molecular modelling of polyolefins is presented. Mesoscopic investigation into the effects of sequence length and sequence length distribution on the reinforcement of stereoblock-stereoregular polyolefins has been performed. These polymers consist of alternating atactic sequences, which are amorphous and act as elastomeric chains, and isotactic sequences which, if long enough, will crystallise, and act as physical reinforcing cross-links. According to simulated morphology, the degrees of crystallinity of the different samples have been predicted. Mechanical properties such as Young's modulus at small extensions are also predicted {{in terms of the}} block size of the alternating isotactic and atactic sequences. Molecular simulation investigation into the influence of the chain microstructure on the conformational behaviour of these polymers has been detailed. Characteristic ratios, calculated {{on the basis of the}} rotational isomeric state model, have indicated the increased extension of the polymer backbone with the increase in the side chain length. The lower characteristic ratio calculated for octene polymers may explain the experimental observation that polyoctene has a lower melting point than other polyolefins.

40|$|The {{rotational}} {{isomeric state}} model {{was employed to}} provide {{a better understanding of}} the role of chain microstructure on the conformational behavior of homogeneous ethylene-l-olefin copolymers. The chain microstructure was assembled in accordance with the copolymerization theory using a set of conditional probabilities in direct relation to the reactivity ratios and the feed compositions of the comonomers. The catalytic inversion influence on the tacticity of the polymeric microstructure was also taken into account by considering the replication probability during the Monte Carlo simulation. Statistical weight factors of the rotational isomeric states were evaluated using molecular dynamics runs of the various homopolymers according to the earlier work of Mattice et al. Probability distribution surfaces constructed by the integration of the molecular dynamics trajectories of sufficient length to sample all of the conformational space indicated the increase of the probability of g(+/-) <b>t</b> <b>joint</b> states at the expense of g(+/-) g(+/-) pairs with the increase in the side chain length of the 1 -olefin comonomers. It was also indicated that this behavior had a maximum around poly(1 -butene) /poly(1 -hexene) with an apparent reversal in case of poly(1 -octene) due to the side chain crowding, which forces the chain to favor more of the g(+/-) g(+/-) joint states. The characteristic ratios calculated for the copolymers on the basis of the rotational isomeric state model also indicated the increased extension of the polymer backbone with the increase in the side chain length. The lower characteristic ratio calculated for the octene polymers may, in fact, explain the experimental observation that poly(1 -octene) has a lower melting point than those of other poly(1 -olefins of shorter side chains. A complete account of the role of tacticity on the characteristic ratio and the radial distribution function is also given. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with experimental tests and computer simulations to determine electrical characteristics of carbon fibre composites used in aerospace. The work has involved an extensive review of published literature, numerical modelling and experimental findings on electrical characterization of carbon fibre composites. The numerical modelling on carbon composites was carried out using finite element package COMSOL, using preliminary conductivity values from literature. Lightning impulse waveform D was used, on a surface electrode to study the effect of lightning strike on carbon composites. Existence of shared equi-potentials was found. Low current testing using variable ply lay ups of carbon composites was performed, the resistance measurements were taken using two probe method for volume conductivity, these values were compared and complied well with the values in literature. Surface resistance was also measured using new techniques, which introduced material and contact resistance into the parasitic resistance, the measurements of parasitic resistance gave an accurate measure of current distortion in variable ply layups. The current distortion was more transverse to the fibre direction and less in line to the fibre direction. High current testing was performed using high voltage system in Cardiff high voltage lab, this was done for two current ranges Amperes and kA range. For both current ranges the samples were tested for mechanical strength requirements keeping in mind the mechanical design requirements for aircraft designers, {{it was found that}} the mechanical strength for samples impact with lightning impulse was not effected in Amperes range however it starts to effect in kA range at 11 kA.

30|$|A {{large number}} of studies on the stress {{intensity}} factor of welded joints have been done by scholars using numerical methods [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Al-Mukhtar et al. [7] evaluated the stress intensity factor of load-carrying cruciform welded joints using 2 D finite element method, considering the effects of weld size and plate thickness ratio. The {{results show that the}} weld size has a major effect on the stress intensity factor, while the plate thickness ratio {{has nothing to do with}} the stress intensity factor. The comparisons between FE solutions and analytical solutions show a good agreement. Chung et al. [8] analyzed the effects of lack-of-penetration crack size, weld leg size, and main plate thickness on mixed-mode stress intensity factors of load-carrying fillet welded cruciform joints using the finite element method and the least-squares method, and the general formulae of modes I and II stress intensity factors obtained from numerical results were verified by experimental results. Pasca et al. [9] determined the 3 D stress intensity factors along the crack growth path of quarter-elliptical corner cracks for <b>T</b> <b>joint</b> using FRANC 3 D in tension and bending loadings; crack growth paths were obtained from Paris’ law based on the maximum tensile stress criterion. Pang et al. [10] studied the 3 D stress intensity factor and weld toe magnification factor of a semielliptical weld toe crack for T-butt joint using the three-dimensional extended finite element method. They investigated the modeling of fatigue crack growth of weld toe semielliptical surface cracks for initial surface cracks with crack depth to plate thickness ratio (a/T) of 0.01 and three different crack aspect ratios (a/c) of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0. The above studies did not consider the effect of corrosion damages on the stress intensity factor. Ghidini et al. [11] simulated corrosion-damaged areas of the specimen surface using a single semielliptical surface crack and a single through edge crack. Cerit [12] modeled the corrosion pit as a semielliptical notch based on the finite element analyses. Generally, corrosion pits can be modeled as cracks or notches in numerical simulation. In all the aforementioned research, however, the effects of corrosion and complex stress fields on the stress intensity factor were studied separately. To date, the stress intensity factor of welded steel joints has never been studied with the simultaneous presence of prior corrosion and complex stress fields.|$|E
40|$|Steel-plate {{composite}} (SC) {{walls are}} {{being used in the}} containment internal structures (CIS) of safety-related nuclear facilities. CIS are labyrinthine in plan, and typically composed of numerous SC walls that intersect each other. This dissertation focuses on the joint shear strength of SC wall-to-wall connection regions in the CIS. ^ SC wall joints and intersections are typically designed to fail with flexural yielding of the connected SC walls. Plastic hinges are expected to form in the SC walls and dissipate energy through inelasticity. In order to ensure that flexural yielding of the SC walls occur prior to joint shear failure, it is important to estimate the joint shear strength of SC wall-to-wall joint regions. ^ Due to the lack of information on the joint shear strength of SC wall-to-wall joints, the equation for reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column joint shear strength given in ACI 349 - 06 Section 21. 5. 3 was adopted in this research. The overall goal of this research is to develop knowledge of the fundamental behavior and joint shear strength of typical SC wall-to-wall joints in safety-related nuclear facilities. Two of the most common joint configurations in the CIS, namely, T-joints and L-joints are considered in this study. However, the focus is primarily on SC wall-to-wall T-joints. ^ A total of four SC wall-to-wall <b>T</b> <b>joint</b> specimens were tested under cyclic loading to investigate the joint shear behavior and joint shear strength. The governing failure mode of each test specimen was evaluated based on the experimental results. The measured joint shear strength was compared with values computed using the equation for RC beam-column joint shear strength given in ACI 349 - 06 (2006), Section 21. 5. 3. ^ Three dimensional finite element models were also developed and analyzed to verify the experimental results and to gain additional insight into the joint shear behavior of the test specimens. Analytical parametric studies were conducted using the benchmarked finite element models to expand the database of SC wall-to-wall T joints and L joints. The parameters included in the analytical studies were the SC wall thickness, SC wall length, steel reinforcement ratio, and concrete strength. ^ The experimental and analytical results indicate that the fundamental behavior and joint shear strength of SC wall-to-wall joints are governed by the steel faceplate reinforcement ratios of the connected SC walls. The effects of steel tie reinforcement ratio and shear stud layout in the joint region are not significant. Finally, the joint shear strength of SC wall-to-wall joints can be estimated conservatively using the applicable ACI 349 RC beam-column joint shear strength equation. ...|$|E
