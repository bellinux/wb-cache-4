500|$|In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith, who {{collaborated with}} Burton on Dark Shadows and , {{to write and}} produce a sequel to Beetlejuice. Grahame-Smith signed on with the {{intention}} of doing [...] "a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat." [...] He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We talked {{for a couple of hours}} and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [...] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> about it who will listen." [...] The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; [...] "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice , time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{day later}} at FAA {{headquarters}} they briefed Vice Admiral Donald D. Engen, {{who watched the}} whole video of over half an hour, and asked them not to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> until they were given the OK, and to prepare an encompassing presentation of the data {{for a group of}} government officials the next day. The meeting was attended by representatives of the FBI, CIA and President Reagan’s Scientific Study Team, among others. Upon completion of the presentation, all present were told that the incident was secret and that their meeting [...] "never took place". According to Callahan, the officials considered the data to represent the first instance of recorded radar data on a UFO, and they took possession of all the presented data. John Callahan however managed to retain the original video, the pilot's report and the FAA's first report in his office. The forgotten target print-outs of the computer data were also rediscovered, from which all targets can be reproduced that were in the sky at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Capri's {{second and}} last film was Good Morning... and Goodbye! (1967). According to Jimmy McDonough, Capri felt betrayed by Meyer after a scene {{she was told}} [...] "alluded to nudity" [...] showed more of her body than Capri was {{comfortable}} with.

60|$|During {{the next}} day no one in camp had reason to {{complain}} of Corona Raybold. She did not seem inclined to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> but spent the {{most of her time}} alone.

60|$|After dinner {{he hardly}} spoke to her; indeed, the room itself,--the same big {{room in which}} they had been {{assembled}} before the feast,--seemed to be ill-adapted for conversation. Again nobody <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> and the minutes went very heavily till at last the carriages were there to take them all home. 'They arranged that you should sit next to her,' said Lady Carbury to her son, {{as they were in the}} carriage.|$|R
5000|$|Twoie starts {{getting better}} grades {{not because he}} is a lot smarter than Will (it was {{demonstrated}} throughout the movie that Will is smart, but he doesn't try) but because Twoie isn't afraid to try, and makes amends with Will's old rival, Scotty DeSota. When the family visits Will's grandfather, who never <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> Twoie asks if being old hurts. Grandfather simply replies, [...] "Not today." [...] They talk and catch up for a long time.|$|R

6000|$|She {{looked at}} him steadily. [...] "There is an {{unpleasant}} feeling {{between me and my}} uncle, but this visit {{has nothing to do with}} it. And I am going to tell you all about it. I hate to feel so much alone in the world that I can't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> about what makes me unhappy. I might have spoken to Mrs. Easterfield, but she didn't ask me.

60|$|I don't {{say that}} every lunch was quite such a success as the first. It's {{not always easy to}} get out of the store if you're a busy man, and a good many of the Whirlwind Committee found that they had just time to hurry down and snatch their lunch and get back again. Still, they came, and {{snatched}} it. As long as the lunches lasted, they came. Even if they had simply to rush it and grab something to eat and drink without time to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> they came.|$|E

2500|$|Child was a {{favorite}} of audiences {{from the moment of}} her television debut on public television in 1963, and she was a familiar part of American culture and the subject of numerous references, including numerous parodies in television and radio programs and skits.

5000|$|Jorgensen had it {{written into}} his {{contract}} at WNEW {{that he was}} the only one who could use a TelePrompTer, and this meant that when he was debriefing a reporter on set, the reporter would have to constantly look at his notes. By contract, Jorgensen would always look steadily into the camera, projecting an air of power and confidence. He warred bitterly with station management, including Ted Kavanau, then news director, who says Jorgensen [...] "was a difficult guy, very moody, hardly <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> but when you turned on that camera, he performed brilliantly. He had a voice that was like fate reaching out to you." ...|$|R
60|$|The captain {{walked by}} the little group of Africans, who {{were sitting on}} the ground, talking in their native tongue, and entered the passage. He climbed over the barrier, and went to the lake. He did not wish to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> but he felt that he must do something, and now was a good time to carry out his {{previous}} intention to cross over the empty bed of the lake and to look out of the opening on the other side. There was no need now to do this for purposes of vigilance, but he thought that if he could get out {{on the other side of}} the cave he might discover some clew to the disappearance of the lake.|$|E
60|$|Strangely enough it was Morris's good genius, Mary, who {{suggested}} the substance, or, rather, {{the mixture of}} substances, whereof {{that portion of the}} aerophone was finally constructed which is still known as the Monk Sound Waves Receiver. Whether, as she alleged, she made this discovery by pure accident, or whether, as seems possible, she had thought the problem out in her own feminine fashion with results that proved excellent, does not matter in the least. The issue remains the same. An apparatus which before would work only on rare occasions--and then without any certitude--between people in the highest state of sympathy or nervous excitement, has now been brought to such a stage of perfection that by its means anybody can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> even if their interests are antagonistic, or their personal enmity bitter.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was in no}} humour to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> or hear himself {{questioned}} as to {{his absence}} from lectures the day before. But {{it was difficult to}} repulse rudely a very good comrade with a smooth pink face and fair hair, bearing the nickname amongst his fellow-students of [...] "Madcap Kostia." [...] He was the idolized only son of a very wealthy and illiterate Government contractor, and attended the lectures only during the periodical fits of contrition following upon tearful paternal remonstrances. Noisily blundering like a retriever puppy, his elated voice and great gestures filled the bare academy corridors with the joy of thoughtless animal life, provoking indulgent smiles at a great distance. His usual discourses treated of trotting horses, wine-parties in expensive restaurants, and the merits of persons of easy virtue, with a disarming artlessness of outlook. He pounced upon Razumov about midday, somewhat less uproariously than his habit was, and led him aside.|$|E

60|$|The {{dinner was}} a most doleful breakdown. The philanthropist {{deranged}} the symmetry of the table, sat himself {{in the way of}} the waiting, blocked up the thoroughfare, and drove Mr. Tope (who assisted the parlour-maid) to the verge of distraction by passing plates and dishes on, over his own head. Nobody could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody,</b> because he held forth to everybody at once, as if the company had no individual existence, but were a Meeting. He impounded the Reverend Mr. Septimus, as an official personage to be addressed, or kind of human peg to hang his oratorical hat on, and fell into the exasperating habit, common among such orators, of impersonating him as a wicked and weak opponent. Thus, he would ask: ‘And will you, sir, now stultify yourself by telling me’—and so forth, when the innocent man had not opened his lips, nor meant to open them. Or he would say: ‘Now see, sir, to what a position you are reduced. I will leave you no escape. After exhausting all the resources of fraud and falsehood, during years upon years; after exhibiting a combination of dastardly meanness with ensanguined daring, such as the world has not often witnessed; you have now the hypocrisy to bend the knee before the most degraded of mankind, and to sue and whine and howl for mercy!’ Whereat the unfortunate Minor Canon would look, in part indignant and in part perplexed; while his worthy mother sat bridling, with tears in her eyes, and the remainder of the party lapsed into a sort of gelatinous state, in which there was no flavour or solidity, and very little resistance.|$|E
60|$|Washington, Sept. 15, 1863. DEAR MOTHER--Your {{letters were}} very acceptable--one came just as I was putting my {{last in the}} post office--I guess they all come right. I have written to Han and George and sent George papers. Mother, have you heard {{anything}} whether the 51st went on with Burnside, or did they remain as a reserve in Kentucky? Burnside has managed splendidly so far, his taking Knoxville and all together--it is a first-class success. I have known Tennessee Union men here in hospital, and I understand it, therefore--the region where Knoxville is is mainly Union, but the Southerners could not exist without it, {{as it is in}} their midst, so they determined to pound and kill and crush out the Unionists--all the savage and monstrous things printed in the papers about their treatment are true, at least that kind of thing is, as bad as the Irish in the mob treated the poor niggers in New York. We North don't understand some things about Southerners; it is very strange, the contrast--if I should pick out the most genuine Union men and real patriots I have ever met in all my experience, I should pick out two or three Tennessee and Virginia Unionists I have met in the hospitals, wounded or sick. One young man I guess I have mentioned to you in my letters, John Barker, 2nd Tennessee Vol. (Union), was a long while a prisoner in Secesh prisons in Georgia, and in Richmond--three times the devils hung him up by the heels to make him promise to give up his Unionism; once he was cut down for dead. He is a young married man with one child. His little property destroyed, his wife and child turned out--he hunted and tormented--and any moment he could have had anything if he would join the Confederacy--but he was firm as a rock; he would not even take an oath to not fight for either side. They held him about eight months--then he was very sick, scurvy, and they exchanged him and he came up from Richmond here to hospital; here I got acquainted with him. He is a large, slow, good-natured man, somehow made me often think of father; shrewd, very little to say--wouldn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> but me. His whole thought was to get back and fight; he was not fit to go, but he has gone back to Tennessee. He spent two days with his wife and young one there, and then to his regiment--he writes to me frequently and I to him; he is not fit to soldier, for the Rebels have destroyed his health and strength (though he is only 23 or 4), but nothing will keep him from his regiment, and fighting--he is uneducated, but as sensible a young man as I ever met, and understands the whole question. Well, mother, Jack Barker is the most genuine Union man I have ever yet met. I asked him once very gravely why he didn't take the Southern oath and get his liberty--if he didn't think he was foolish to be so stiff, etc. I never saw such a look as he gave me, he thought I was in earnest--the old devil himself couldn't have had put a worse look in his eyes. Mother, I have no doubt there are quite a good many just such men. He is down there with his regiment (one of his brothers was killed)--when he fails in strength he gets the colonel to detach him to do teamster's duty for a few days, on a march till he recruits his strength--but he always carries his gun with him--in a battle he is always in the ranks--then he is so sensible, such decent manly ways, nothing shallow or mean (he must have been a giant in health, but now he is weaker, has a cough too). Mother, can you wonder at my getting so attached to such men, with such love, especially when they show it to me--some of them on their dying beds, and in the very hour of death, or just the same when they recover, or partially recover? I never knew what American young men were till I have been in the hospitals. Well, mother, I have got writing on--there is nothing new with me, just the same old thing, as I suppose it is with you there. Mother, how is Andrew? I wish to hear all about him--I do hope he is better, and that it will not prove anything so bad. I will write to him soon myself, but in the meantime you must tell him to not put so much faith in medicine--drugs, I mean--as in the true curative things; namely, diet and careful habits, breathing good air, etc. You know I wrote in a former letter what is the cause and foundation of the diseases of the throat and what must be the remedy that goes {{to the bottom of the}} thing--sudden attacks are to be treated with applications and medicines, but diseases of a seated character are not to be cured by them, only perhaps a little relieved (and often aggravated, made firmer).|$|E
