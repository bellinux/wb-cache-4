500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> out of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E

500|$|Howe favoured {{as quick}} a {{transition}} to a peacetime economy as possible. Most industries in which there were not shortages were released from government controls in late 1945. Labour leaders, fearing unemployment, wanted to keep wartime government plants in production; Howe opposed such proposals. When union members who were laid off from the Research Enterprises Limited (R.E.L.) confronted Howe on a golf course, the minister stated, [...] "R.E.L. was a war-time plant. The war is through, the plant is through, and your union... what happens to your union is up <b>to</b> you. <b>Get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> off of <b>the</b> course." [...] In disposing of redundant government property, Howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored {{since the end of}} the Boer War and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years. He strove to eliminate such anachronisms. [...] However, Howe was slower to release economic controls. According to Roberts, [...] "although he worked to return the country's economic power to private hands, he often seemed as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to Parliament". [...] In November 1945, Howe's wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form the Department of Reconstruction and Supply.|$|R

2500|$|Facing a Dallas {{defense that}} had allowed its {{previous}} six opponents {{an average of}} less than ten points per game, the Buccaneers were in immediate trouble. Doug Williams was sacked on the game's very first play. Field position was a problem, with the Buccaneers' first-half drives starting {{at an average of}} the 19-yard line. Tampa Bay was only able to advance beyond midfield four times during the entire game, and Williams was pressured into mistakes by a constant Dallas pass rush. The ground game was held to only 2 yards in the second half, with James Owens starting at running back in place of the injured Jerry Eckwood. The Dallas front four of Ed [...] "Too Tall" [...] Jones, Harvey Martin, Randy White, and John Dutton dominated the Buccaneers' offensive line, moving them backwards with 59 yards in sacks and forcing two intentional grounding penalties. They batted down several of Williams' passes, and Jones caught one of Williams' four interceptions. Tom Landry said that it was the best performance by a Dallas front four since their Super Bowl XII victory over Denver in 1978, and credited their intensity for the difference. Interceptions by Jones and Michael Downs set up two third-quarter touchdowns, helping the Cowboys to match their largest-ever margin of victory. Dallas committed no turnovers, and all tipped passes wound {{up in the hands of}} Cowboys players. It was the last time that an NFL playoff team had been shut out since the Buccaneers' NFC Championship loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the 1979 postseason. McKay had few comments after the game, telling the press, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> out of here".|$|E

Poor and lacking the social confidence of his classmates, at graduation he finds himself attracted to Sara Weller (Lizzy Caplan), who {{is part of a}} close-knit quartet of drug users that includes her boyfriend Troy (Jonathon Trent) and their friends Lucas (D.J. Cotrona) and Erin (Jenny Wade). Sara returns his interest but the rest of her group discourage Jonah's attention. However, after the group learn that he works part-time at a pharmacy doing delivery, they bring them into his world for the summer, in exchange for his stealing prescription drugs for them. Jonah's mother, Sandra (Daryl Hannah), is too busy working multiple jobs to try to keep up appearances, to try to deal with her son's sudden change in behavior. As <b>the</b> group <b>gets</b> more experimental with their drugs of choice, Jonah unravels as he becomes more and more obsessed with Sara. After Troy dies under questionable circumstances, his parents hire private investigator Phil Hackwith (Bruce A. Young) {{to try to find out}} the truth. The investigator questions all four of the teens with little results. A few days later, Sara comes to visit Jonah at work, stating that she feels empty and doesn't know why she's there. Jonah asks her to come away to Tijuana with him for the weekend, she agrees. The next morning, the private investigator watches from his parked car as they pull out of the driveway together. They proceed to drink lots of tequila and drunkenly kiss in the hotel room, which leads to sex, during which Sara asks Jonah to stop and he does not. Afterwards, she is clearly distraught and demands to be taken home. They return to California that evening. The next day at work, Lucas storms in and informs Jonah's boss that Jonah has been stealing pills and selling them. Jonah is not able to deny this and is subsequently fired. He shows up in Sara's backyard uninvited later that night, ignoring her requests that he leave, and confesses that he was the one who bought the drugs for Troy. He asks her if she will run away to Mexico with him, saying he'll rob the pharmacy for pills and money. She says [...] "okay", primarily <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> out of her backyard. On the day they are scheduled to depart. Jonah loses his temper and physically abuses his mother. He later meets Sara in the bathroom of Lucas' house. He tries to convince her that she has feelings for him; she doesn't. Jonah attempts to give her drugs but she is reluctant to taking them. During this time the private investigator comes to Lucas' house and asks for Sara. Erin goes looking for her. After realizing that Sara will never love him, Jonah commits suicide by stabbing himself with a pair of scissors. The film is ended with Lucas, Erin, and the private investigator walking into the bathroom and seeing Jonah's dead body with Sara frightened in the corner.|$|R
