30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this paper is}} organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multicast channel and formulate the transmit beamforming problem. In Section 3, we analyze the special case of two <b>Tx</b> <b>antennas</b> and deduce a new formulation for the beamformer design. Based on the new formulation, the PASA is proposed to obtain a globally optimal beamforming vector. For the case of more than two <b>Tx</b> <b>antennas,</b> we propose the I 2 DO algorithm in Section 4. Section 5 presents simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.|$|R

In {{this paper}} we present some channel {{measurement}} results of distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) systems inside a MD- 82 aircraft. Channel capacity and spatial correlation are analyzed from the measured channel matrix. Capacity results of 7 different systems (six D-MIMO systems and a SISO system) are discussed. It is found that D-MIMO systems yield significant capacity gains {{as compared to}} SISO system. Spatial correlations among transmitter (Tx) antennas distributed above the cabin aisle are statistically analyzed from the measured data. Result shows that, when receiver (Rx) antenna array {{is placed in the}} front or back of the cabin, some <b>Tx</b> <b>antenna</b> pairs are highly correlative (correlation coefficients are higher than 0. 8). The effect of <b>Tx</b> <b>antenna</b> selection on capacity characteristic of in-cabin D-MIMO system is also studied.

40|$|Orthogonality {{is a much}} desired {{property}} for MIMO coding. It enables symbol-wise decoding, where the errors in other symbol estimates do not affect the result, thus providing an optimality that is worth pursuing. Another beneficial property is a low complexity soft decision decoder, which for orthogonal complex MIMO codes is known for two transmit (<b>Tx)</b> <b>antennas</b> i. e. for the Alamouti code. We propose novel soft decision decoders for the orthogonal complex MIMO codes on three and four <b>Tx</b> <b>antennas</b> and extend the old result of maximal ratio combining (MRC) to cover all orthogonal codes up to four <b>Tx</b> <b>antennas.</b> As a rule, a sophisticated transmission scheme encompasses forward error correction (FEC) coding, and its performance is measured at the FEC decoder instead of at the MIMO decoder. We introduce the receiver structure that delivers the MIMO decoder's soft decisions to the demodulator, which in turn cranks out the logarithm of likelihood ratio (LLR) of each bit and delivers them to the FEC decoder. This makes a significant improvement on the receiver, where a maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO decoder makes hard decisions at a too early stage. Further, the additional gain is achieved with stunningly low complexity. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 9 Dec. 200...|$|R

For further improvement, we propose a so-called selective scheme which instantly measures the reliability of the detected symbols at each iteration and then exclude the unreliable symbols in the estimated interference generation.|$|E
