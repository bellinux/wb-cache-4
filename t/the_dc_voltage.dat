The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to the capacitor. The DC input resistance of the electrometer is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its AC input impedance is lower).|$|E

3000|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the {{reference}} d-current component i_d^ref of the GSC should choose the minimum value between the current command of the PI controller for <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> regulation and √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2), as shown in Fig.  2. Considering the engineering operability in the electrical data collection process, however, the value of i_d^ref is always set as √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2) in the Eq. (3). As a result, if {{the right side of the}} Eq. (3) is not lower than 0, the GSC still fails to meet the adjusted requirement of the PI controller for <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> regulation, even though the value of the reference d-current component i_d^ref has been set as its current limit. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> will rise. If the right side of the Eq. (3) is lower than 0, <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> will fluctuate near the normal value since the GSC can meet the adjusted requirement of the PI controller for <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> regulation. In this paper, when <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> rises or fluctuates, it can be distinguished based on the relationship between <b>the</b> post-fault <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> and <b>the</b> normal value, e.g., if <b>the</b> post-fault <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> calculated based on Eq. (3) is lower than the normal value, it means <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> will fluctuate near the normal value, otherwise it will rise.|$|R

500|$|The 147 is the [...] "universal" [...] {{version of}} the 122, {{designed}} for many organs, and has a different amplifier input and motor speed control, but is otherwise identical. The signal input is unbalanced, allowing a simpler connection to organs that have a built-in speaker system, such as the Hammond A100, or a Wurlitzer. The motor speed switching uses a separate AC signal, rather than <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> control of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122's lower susceptibility to induced noise, and a delay between operation of the speed control and the actual change in speed. As with the 122 and 142, the 145 {{is identical to the}} 147, except that it is housed in a [...] cabinet, and thus slightly easier to move. As with the 122, Hammond-Suzuki manufactures a modern replacement, the 147A. The model X-77, released in 1968, was designed to accompany Hammond's new tonewheel / transistor organ, the X-66. It contained seven different tab controls and six speakers. It has a completely different interface from other Leslies, using a 12-pin amphenol connector.|$|E

40|$|In photovoltaic, {{fuel cells}} and storage batteries, <b>the</b> low output <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> should be boosted.

30|$|By {{incorporating}} <b>the</b> ESS, <b>the</b> <b>dc</b> link <b>voltage</b> fluctuation can {{be reduced}} by increasing the current cut-off frequency.

2500|$|Another {{alternative}} {{replaces the}} half bridge MMC submodule described above, {{with a full}} bridge submodule containing four IGBTs in an H bridge arrangement, instead of two. [...] The full-bridge variant of MMC allows the submodule capacitor to be inserted into the circuit in either polarity. [...] This confers additional flexibility in controlling the converter and allows the converter to block the fault current which arises from a short-circuit between {{the positive and negative}} DC terminals (something which is impossible with any of the preceding types of VSC). [...] Furthermore it allows <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems. However, the full-bridge arrangement requires twice as many IGBTs and has higher power losses than the equivalent half-bridge arrangement.|$|E
30|$|When {{the grid}} voltage dips, the brake chopper results in {{negligible}} speed changes {{in both the}} wind turbine and generator, so the speed index cannot completely represent the transient characteristics of the PMSGs. However, as the GSC switches to a reactive power priority control pattern, <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> undergoes a significant change, and the changes between different operating conditions of PMSGs are obviously different. For the PMSG subjected to a high wind speed, <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> may continue to rise until {{the threshold of the}} brake chopper, and then the chopper circuit is triggered. As for the PMSG subjected to a low wind speed, <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> may only show a slight fluctuation in the neighborhood of the normal value (1.0  pu), since the unbalanced active power delivered by the generator to <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link is relatively small and <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> can be effectively adjusted by the GSC.|$|R
40|$|Two-stage {{single-phase}} grid-connected converters {{are widely}} used in renewable energy applications.

This paper presents a fast <b>DC</b> bus <b>voltage</b> controller, which uses a second order digital finite impulse response (FIR) notch filter in conjunction with input power feedforward scheme to ensure the steady-state and dynamic performance.

2500|$|Most of the HVDC {{systems in}} {{operation}} today {{are based on}} line-commutated converters (LCC). [...] The term line-commutated indicates that the conversion process relies on the line voltage of the AC system to which the converter is connected in order to effect the commutation from one switching device to its neighbour. Line-commutated converters use switching devices that are either uncontrolled (such as diodes) or {{that can only be}} turned on (not off) by control action, such as thyristors. Although HVDC converters can, in principle, be constructed from diodes, such converters can only be used in rectification mode and the lack of controllability of <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> is a serious disadvantage. [...] Consequently, in practice all LCC HVDC systems use either grid-controlled mercury-arc valves (until the 1970s) or thyristors (to the present day).|$|E
2500|$|... 1949: A chopper-stabilized op-amp. In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg {{designed}} a chopper-stabilized op-amp. This set-up uses a normal op-amp {{with an additional}} AC amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from DC by switching between <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> and ground at a fast rate (60Hz or 400Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp ICs started {{to show up in}} the field.|$|E
2500|$|With {{some other}} types of {{semiconductor}} device such as the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), both turn-on and turn-off can be controlled, giving a second degree of freedom. As a result, IGBTs {{can be used to}} make self-commutated converters. In such converters, the polarity of DC voltage is usually fixed and <b>the</b> <b>DC</b> <b>voltage,</b> being smoothed by a large capacitance, can be considered constant. [...] For this reason, an HVDC converter using IGBTs is usually referred to as a voltage-source converter (or voltage-sourced converter). [...] The additional controllability gives many advantages, notably the ability to switch the IGBTs on and off many times per cycle in order to improve the harmonic performance, and the fact that (being self-commutated) the converter no longer relies on synchronous machines in the AC system for its operation. [...] A voltage-sourced converter can therefore feed power to an AC network consisting only of passive loads, something which is impossible with LCC HVDC. Voltage-source converters are also considerably more compact than line-commutated converters (mainly because much less harmonic filtering is needed) and are preferable to line-commutated converters in locations where space is at a premium, for example on offshore platforms.|$|E
