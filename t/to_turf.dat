5|$|After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} in August 2002, Mitchell was demoted to the fourth wide receiver behind Pinkston, Thrash, and Freeman. Mitchell mainly contributed on special teams for the Eagles throughout the 2002 season. In the first fifteen weeks of the season, Mitchell caught {{a total of six}} passes for 53yards as a backup. Against the Cowboys in week sixteen, Pinkston left the game due <b>to</b> <b>turf</b> toe, and Mitchell caught two passes for 17yards in his place. Mitchell started in place of Pinkston in the last regular season game against the Giants on December 28, and led the team in receiving with four catches for 35yards.|$|E
5|$|His {{professional}} career {{came to an}} end when he was released by Burnley in May 1992, although he subsequently had spells in non-league football with Chorley, Barrow and Great Harwood Town, while taking his coaching qualifications. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, he left Great Harwood and joined Northern Premier League outfit Mossley, where he made 23 league appearances before retiring in 1997 to take up a non-playing position at Rochdale. He returned <b>to</b> <b>Turf</b> Moor on 7 May 2007 to play in a testimonial match for long-serving Burnley player Graham Branch.|$|E
5|$|Turf Moor {{is located}} {{to the east}} of Burnley town centre. The stadium has two car parks of its own, and there are also a number of parking {{facilities}} in the surrounding area. The railway station with the shortest walk <b>to</b> <b>Turf</b> Moor is Burnley Manchester Road. The stadium is also accessible from Burnley Central station on the East Lancashire Line which, although it is physically closer to the ground, is a slightly further walk due to the street layout and the intervening river. There are also a number of bus services in the area, and Turf Moor is very close to Burnley Bus Station.|$|E

5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return <b>to</b> <b>Turf</b> Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness and injury. A collision with Wycombe Wanderers' Jason Cousins on 20 February 1999 spelt {{the beginning of the}} end for Swan's career, as the result of a scan showed he had snapped the cruciate ligament in his right knee.|$|E
5|$|The Championship season started {{badly for}} Bolton, {{with only three}} wins in ten league matches and a second round exit from the League Cup {{following}} a loss at Crawley Town. As a result of poor performances leaving them in 16th place, Bolton sacked Coyle on 9 October 2012, replacing him with Crystal Palace's Dougie Freedman. They finished in 7th place, losing out on a play-off place to Leicester City on goal difference. The 2013–14 began with a trip <b>to</b> <b>Turf</b> Moor, in celebration of the 125th anniversary of the Football League. Freedman was fired after a torrid run of results {{at the beginning of}} the 2014–2015 season; he was replaced by former Celtic manager Neil Lennon, who promptly won his first game in charge 1–0 away at Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|The Cadets' home {{field is}} Sabine Field at Haynes Family Stadium.

25|$|The stadium was {{the first}} stadium in Australia to have movable seating. All four level-one tiers of the stadium can be moved up to 18 metres forward into a {{rectangular}} configuration. It was first used for a Melbourne Storm game in July 2001. Despite the seating being a key feature of the stadium, it has rarely been used, citing damage <b>to</b> <b>turf,</b> time to deploy the seats and a reduced capacity (the corners of the stadium in level 1 are not movable).|$|E
25|$|Chain Reaction is a {{mode that}} is similar <b>to</b> <b>Turf</b> War. This has the player {{capturing}} posts, but the player must do them in a specific order – one team works out from their base needing to capture 1 through 5 while the other team starts out from their home and needs to snag 5 through 1. King of the Hill has players capturing a hill, spawned on the map to score points. They must stay in the hill to score points while the enemy team tries to do the same.|$|E
25|$|Sanders had {{the best}} postseason {{performance}} of his career, finishing the game with 167 rushing yards. Perriman caught 10 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. Sharpe, who had not practiced {{in the last eight}} weeks due <b>to</b> <b>turf</b> toe (though he was still able to play in games) and had set the NFL single season record for receptions in their week 17 meeting against Detroit, caught five passes for 101 yards and tied a playoff record with three touchdowns.

He faced Tentam, who had set a world record for [...] miles on the turf earlier that summer, and five others. [...] Secretariat went to the lead early, followed by Tentam, who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch. Tentam got to within a half-length before Secretariat responded, pulling away by three lengths. Tentam made another run around the far turn, but Secretariat again drew away, eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam, with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third. Secretariat set a course record time of 2:24. After the race, Ron Turcotte explained that [...] "when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him and he pulled away".|$|E
500|$|Turf Moor hosted {{its first}} Football League match on 6 October 1888, when Burnley won 4–1 against Bolton Wanderers. Five {{minutes into the}} game, Burnley centre forward Fred Poland scored the first ever league goal at the ground. In 1891 the Burnley Union Star Football Club disbanded, abandoning their Rakehead ground, which was {{complete}} with its own grandstand. Burnley bought the stand and moved it <b>to</b> <b>Turf</b> Moor. It {{became known as the}} [...] "Star" [...] stand and was erected {{on the site of the}} current James Hargreaves Stand, on the north side of the ground. In March of the same year, Turf Moor hosted its first floodlit football match. Sixteen creosote-fuelled lamps were placed at regular intervals along the sides of the pitch, and spectators reported that while the edges of the field were sufficiently lit, there was a dark area in the centre. Burnley won the match, beating Nelson 4–2 in front of a crowd of 3,000 people.|$|E

500|$|On {{the return}} journey from England, the Australians toured India and Pakistan {{for the first}} time, with mixed results. On a matting pitch, {{unfamiliar}} to the Australians, Johnson's team lost the inaugural Test against Pakistan at Karachi. Responding to the loss, a cartoon drawn by Norman Mitchell of the Adelaide News newspaper suggested island planters {{might be able to}} scrape together a team that would be a match for the Australians. [...] Returning <b>to</b> <b>turf</b> pitches in India, the Australians restored some pride. [...] Johnson was the highest scorer in the Australian team's victory by an innings and five runs in the First Test at Nehru Stadium in Madras. Due to injury, both Johnson and Miller missed the drawn Second Test at Brabourne Stadium at Bombay; Lindwall skippered the side. [...] Johnson returned for the Third Test at Eden Gardens, Calcutta for what would ultimately prove to be his final Test. The Australians won the match by 94runs, giving them a 20 series win. S. K. Gurunathan, summing up in the Indian Cricket Almanack, wrote: [...] "The Australians showed themselves to be a superior side even when their batting failed".|$|E
2500|$|The Bayerische Grenzpolizei (BGP) were {{a product}} of Bavaria's semi-detached {{relationship}} {{with the rest of}} West Germany. The Bavarian government argued that the 1949 Basic Law vested police powers {{in the hands of the}} Länder and not the federal government, and thus that the BZV had no business carrying out police duties on Bavarian soil. It consequently raised its own border police force, the BGP, to carry out policing duties along the [...] length of the inner German border in Bavaria. By the late 1960s, the BGP had 600men patrolling its sector of the border, alongside the BZV, BGS and U.S. Army– effectively duplicating the duties of the BZV. Not surprisingly, this led <b>to</b> <b>turf</b> wars between the two agencies.|$|E
2500|$|Muslim leaders {{established}} a joint command of all Palestinian groups except As-Sa'iqa, which {{was driven by}} the PLO to its stronghold near the main airport. Shortly afterwards, As-Sa'iqa and other leftist Damascus forces were absorbed by the Syrian military. On 8 June 1976 Syrian forces were pushed back from Sidon, encountering stiff resistance in Beirut from the LNM. Assad's actions [...] angered much of the Arab world however {{and the sight of}} Syria trying to eliminate the PLO brought criticism upon him. There was considerable hostility to Assad's alliance with the Maronites in Syria. As a result, the Syrian government asked the Arab League to assist in the conflict. The Arab League began to mediate, establishing the Arab Deterrent Force (ADF) for peacekeeping. Syrian strategy at this point was to gradually weaken the LNM and its Palestinian collaborators, continuing to support the Christian militia. However, the Syrians were unable to capture the LNM's stronghold of Aley before the Arab League called for a ceasefire on 17 October. The Arab League strengthened the ADF to 30,000 troops, most Syrian. While some heavy fighting continued, by December 1976 and January 1977 most [...] Palestinian and Lebanese groups had disposed of their heavy weaponry. According to Charles Winslow, the [...] "main phase" [...] of the Lebanese Civil War had ended by 1977; until the early 1990s most violence was attributed <b>to</b> <b>turf,</b> proxy, inter-communal and state wars.|$|E

50|$|One such group, {{numbering}} about forty, {{were gathered}} by Father John Murphy {{near the village}} of The Harrow on the evening of the 26 May.
