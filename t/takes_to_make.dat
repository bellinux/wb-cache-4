She later admitted that the couple were naive about what it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a successful fashion enterprise. Edun encountered problems with both quality of goods and delivery times from their African suppliers, and most of the stores originally carrying the line dropped it. It lost €9.7 million in 2007 and €12.8 million in 2008, suffering {{along with the rest of}} the apparel sector from the credit crisis of 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Hitchcock transitioned to Hollywood productions, {{the first}} of which was the {{psychological}} thriller Rebecca starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won Best Picture. Hitchcock worked with Fontaine again the following year on the film Suspicion which also starred Cary Grant. In 1943 Hitchcock directed another psychological thriller Shadow of a Doubt which starred Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Three years later he reunited with Grant on Notorious which also starred Ingrid Bergman. The film included a three-minute intermittent kissing scene between the leads shot specifically to skirt the Motion Picture Production Code which at the time limited such scenes to three seconds. In 1948 Hitchcock directed Rope which starred James Stewart. The film was his first in Technicolor and is remembered for its use of long <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film appear to be a single continuous shot. Three years later he directed Strangers on a Train (1951).|$|E

25|$|Word naming task: During a word naming task, a {{participant}} is {{presented with a}} drawing or object and is asked to name the drawing or the object. Usually during a naming task, response latencies (the time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a response) are recorded for each word. Sometimes response accuracies are recorded as well. An example of this word naming task is the Boston Naming Test, which has been used on various studies that examine the bilingual lexical access.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{organizations}} and institutions, most Mexican artisans are impoverished with little access to quality materials or designs, {{because of lack}} of cultural knowledge. Artisans also must compete with goods manufactured in large factories and copies of Mexican artesania imported from places like China. This keeps prices down, and the time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> authentic artesanía puts the Mexican craftsmen at an economic disadvantage. This is one reason why younger generations have less interest in the craft tradition.|$|E
25|$|On 26 December 2016, {{the band}} {{announced}} that new music due for release at an unspecified date in 2017 on their Twitter account.

In September 2017, the band signed a new recording deal with BMG Rights Management which will release their seventh studio album in early 2018. The deal reunites the group with Howlett's song publishing, which BMG had acquired from EMI Music Publishing in 2012 as part of the Virgin Music catalogue.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{can be useful}} for drying wood for {{construction}} and wood fuels such as wood chips for combustion. Solar is also used for food products such as fruits, grains, and fish. Crop drying by solar means is environmentally friendly as well as cost effective while improving the quality. The less money it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a product, the less it can be sold for, pleasing both the buyers and the sellers. Technologies in solar drying include ultra low cost pumped transpired plate air collectors based on black fabrics. Solar thermal energy is helpful {{in the process of}} drying products such as wood chips and other forms of biomass by raising the temperature while allowing air to pass through and get rid of the moisture.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} periods {{associated with the}} lunar orbit. The sidereal month is the time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one complete orbit around Earth {{with respect to the}} fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year, but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday's Task: When Eric was {{nominated}} for Thursday's eviction, his Tuesday night task was to flatter and do whatever it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure a specific person did not vote to evict him, and he completed this task if that person voted to evict the other nominee. When Eric was not nominated, then his Tuesday night task was to target {{one of the two}} nominees for eviction. Eric automatically voted for the winner of the AP poll, and he completed the task if the majority of HouseGuests voted to evict the same player he had been instructed to target. Eric successfully completed five of the eight tasks involving persuading the house to evict a nominee. The one time Eric was on the block and had to flatter Dick to secure their vote, he chose not to.|$|E

25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we start talking about the things it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift {{in the way we}} approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes.

500|$|The {{video was}} shot on May 30, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Unexpectedly, several girls began crying during the shoot; Cyrus {{attributed}} {{this to the}} emotions in the song. Ratner was impressed with Cyrus' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them [...] "fun at the same time". Ratner compared her to Madonna, saying, [...] "she can be hanging out and laughing, and then you put the camera on her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'" [...] The effervescence made editing {{more difficult for the}} director. He said, [...] "It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great.

500|$|A 2011 {{article in}} New York Magazine {{described}} {{the company as}} the [...] "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" [...] because of its unwavering commitment to [...] "total honesty and accountability" [...] and minute detail in its corporate culture.

In addition, Dalio says that he fosters [...] "an extreme meritocracy of ideas" [...] and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm, but they must be prepared to be challenged in return. The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.|$|E
500|$|Talk of a {{potential}} sequel to The Terminator arose soon after its release, but several outstanding issues precluded such a production. There were technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial {{in the creation of}} the T-1000 Terminator. The production of James Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss provided the proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve the technical concerns. Perhaps more serious were the intellectual-property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation, which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel, and Carolco Pictures. Given that Hemdale was then experiencing financial problems, Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Mario Kassar, head of Carolco, to bid for the rights: [...] "I reminded Mario that this is something that we've been looking for four years, and that it should be him that should go all-out, no matter what it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this deal." [...] Carolco eventually paid Hemdale $5million for the franchise in 1990, resolving the legal gridlock.|$|E
