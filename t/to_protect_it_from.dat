5|$|Filmed in full scale, {{the school}} {{explosion}} used drywall around {{the interior of}} the set <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction surprised the cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site and <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E

5|$|No. 71 Maintenance Unit RAF in Slough {{came under}} {{control of the}} Ruislip depot in January 1941. The {{increase}} in personnel lead to {{an extension of the}} station canteen in May. Additionally, a Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI) canteen was built on the RAF Blenheim Crescent site on 6 May. In order <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> potential enemy bombing, the majority of the Records Office was moved to a temporary base in Gloucester on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E

5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear {{to indicate that the}} danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat {{through the skin}} because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller {{than that of a}} human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
50|$|This potoo {{is a large}} cypselomorph bird {{related to}} the nightjars and frogmouths, but like other potoos it lacks the {{bristles}} around the mouth found in the true nightjars. It is 33-38 cm long and pale greyish to brown, finely patterned with black and buff, camouflaged {{to look like a}} log; this is a safety measure <b>to</b> help <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> predators, but its mode of perch is also a camouflage. It has large orange eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} variant from the {{original}} 12BV7 was the 12BY7A. In this case, the A suffix is used to indicate a backwards-compatible revision to the original specification. Specifically, the heater filament had been redesigned <b>to</b> further <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the potentially damaging voltage spikes which were known to occur when the tube heater circuits were wired in series rather than parallel. All of the other design specifications, including warmup time, were identical to the 12BY7.|$|R

5|$|Heraclius {{abandoned}} Syria {{with the}} holy relic of the True Cross which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem, just <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the invading Arabs. It is said that the emperor had a fear of water. and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, after which Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, Varian {{announced}} {{that she would be}} working with the California Rangeland Trust to place her ranch into a conservation easement <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> development. She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E
5|$|Ludlow Castle {{was in the}} {{wardship}} of King Henry IV, {{when the}} Owain Glyndŵr revolt broke out across Wales. Military captains were appointed to the castle <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the rebel threat, {{in the first instance}} John Lovel and then Henry's half-brother, Sir Thomas Beaufort. Roger Mortimer's younger brother, Edmund, set out from the castle with an army against the rebels in 1402, but was captured at the Battle of Bryn Glas. Henry refused to ransom him, and he eventually married one of Glyndŵr's daughters, before dying during the siege of Harlech Castle in 1409.|$|E
50|$|Douiret (Berber: Eddwirat or igherman, دويرات) is {{a ruined}} Berber {{village in the}} Tataouine {{district}} in southern Tunisia.

5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> floods, and {{was connected to the}} river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with, which is hard to identify today.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Level Navigations are {{a network}} of {{waterways}} in England, primarily used for land drainage, which lie in The Fens between the Rivers Nene and Great Ouse, and between the cities of Peterborough and Cambridge. Most of the area through which they run is at or below sea level, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> inundation {{have been carried out}} since 1480. The Middle Level was given its name by the Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden in 1642, who subsequently constructed several drainage channels to make the area suitable for agriculture. Water levels were always managed to allow navigation, and Commissioners were established in 1754 to maintain the waterways and collect tolls from commercial traffic.|$|E
5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
