5|$|Gorgon was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into action}} as she bombarded German {{artillery}} positions in Belgium {{at the end}} of July 1918. She bombarded the Snaeskerk bridge on 28 and 29 September, but produced a single near-miss. She fired at German artillery batteries again on 14 October, but had to retreat hurriedly when she was straddled by heavy German return fire and she was hit by splinters from near-misses. The next day she bombarded another bridge; the last rounds fired by a Royal Navy warship at targets in Occupied Belgium.|$|E

25|$|In May 1965, Rascon and {{his unit}} were {{deployed}} to the Republic of Vietnam {{where he served}} as a medic for a platoon of paratroopers. The brigade was the first major ground combat unit of the United States Army to serve there.

25|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up was the SIV 1 {{building}}, which {{housed the}} Federal Executive Council (SIV). The building has 75,000 square metres of usable space.

The building was renamed to Palata Srbije, and now houses some departments of the Serbian government.|$|E

One juror opted for acquittal, while eleven were in favor of conviction.|$|E
25|$|Scrapping of DD class {{locomotives}} commenced {{as early}} as 1929, with newer K and N class locomotives taking over branch line goods services and Petrol Electric Rail Motors (and later Diesel Electric Rail Motors) starting to replace mixed trains and locomotive-hauled branch line passenger services. The unrebuilt saturated steam D1 class locomotives were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> and by 1951 no fewer than 120 had been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|According to the Chanson d'Antioche, Rotrou {{was under}} the command of Bohemond of Taranto during the Siege of Antioch, and was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over the city's walls through scaling ladders on 3 June 1098. When the Crusaders had to confront a Seljuk relief force two weeks later in open battle, Rotrou was one of the front line commanders. He {{fulfilled}} his vow and made {{it all the way to}} Jerusalem. The Chanson also mentions his bravery at the Battle of Nicaea.|$|E

25|$|With the loss, the Lions became {{only the}} second NFL team of the post-merger era to go winless without a tie in the regular season, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> 0–16. (The 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers also went winless, but {{that was when the}} regular season only had {{fourteen}} games.) The Lions ended 2008 having lost 23 of their last 24 regular-season games, going back to the previous season, and a total of seventeen consecutive regular season losses (the NFL record is 26 by the Buccaneers, who lost the next twelve games after their winless season).|$|E
25|$|The {{biography}} of Anthony's life by Athanasius of Alexandria helped {{to spread the}} concept of Christian monasticism, particularly in Western Europe via its Latin translations. He is often erroneously considered the first Christian monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the wilderness (about 270), a geographical move {{that seems to have}} contributed to his renown. Accounts of Anthony enduring supernatural temptation during his sojourn in the Eastern Desert of Egypt inspired the often-repeated subject of the temptation of St. Anthony in Western art and literature.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{intended}} all of {{his children}} to be educated in the United States. Ai-Ling, at the early age of thirteen, was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> becoming a special student at Wesleyan College in Georgia. All three sisters attended Wesleyan, with Ching-Ling and May-Ling moving to Georgia in 1907. Ai-Ling graduated in 1909, and moved back to China. Charlie installed her as Sun Yat-Sen’s secretary, in charge of handling his correspondence and of decoding messages {{to him from the}} republicans. A few years later in 1911, Sun Yat-Sen was successful in bringing about the Xinhai Revolution, and the Qing Dynasty fell to be replaced by the short-lived presidency of Sun Yat-Sen.|$|E

25|$|Kodiak bears begin {{entering}} their dens in late October. Pregnant sows {{are usually}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to dens; males are the last. Males begin emerging from their dens in early April, while sows with new cubs may stay in dens until late June. Bears {{living on the}} north end of Kodiak Island tend to have longer denning periods than bears in the southern areas. Most Kodiak bears dig their dens in hill or mountain sides and they use a wide variety of denning habitats depending on which part of the archipelago they live. Almost a quarter of the adult bears forgo denning, staying somewhat active throughout the winter.|$|E
25|$|In September 2017, Zach Adams was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on trial. The prosecution's {{case was}} largely circumstantial, {{as there was}} no DNA or other {{forensic}} evidence tying Zach to the murder. Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified {{to a series of}} events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction, but that he went to Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime. He said Zach had a body {{in the back of his}} truck wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel.|$|E
25|$|Anders {{was born}} on October 17, 1933, in Hong Kong, to U.S. Navy Lt. Arthur F. Anders (d. 2000) and Muriel Adams Anders (d. 1990). The family moved to Annapolis, Maryland, where Lt. Anders taught {{mathematics}} at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. After that, the Anders returned to China, but Muriel and Bill escaped to the Philippines after the Japanese attacked Nanking. They escaped by troop train to Canton; eating Campbell's soup boiled in a bucket for sustenance. The hotel they stayed at was 200 yards from the river the Japanese were bombing, the same river {{they would have to}} travel down to escape. Their ship was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down the river after the Chinese had mined it.|$|E

25|$|Byrne {{initiated}} a Dutch auction IPO of Overstock.com in 2002. The company {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> public under a system advanced by WR Hambrecht + Co to retain {{a greater share of}} capital within the company rather than going to the investment bank underwriters used in conventional public offerings. Byrne has said that competing banks reacted against this, attempting to obstruct the success of the offering through negative reports and by shorting the company's stock. When Google later in 2004 went public via a Dutch auction IPO, Byrne commented that Wall Street firms similarly pushed negative stories, but did not keep it from going forward successfully. Four years after the OpenIPO, one official of Hambrecht, its now former co-CEO Clay Corbus was added to Overstock's board of directors.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> {{beaten by}} one pushed quicker through the air. Gilchrist was adjudged lbw {{of a similar}} {{delivery}} but had cause to be aggrieved; replays showed the ball pitched well outside legstump and he had some bat on the ball. With Harbhajan on a hattrick, Shane Warne was surrounded by men around the bat, with Sadagopan Ramesh at short leg {{the man who would}} eventually claim the catch from a tentative prod. The on field umpires referred it to the third umpire, who took a long time making the tough decision before finally declaring Warne out. An emotional Harbhajan later remembered his father in the post match interview; his captain Sourav Ganguly would call it a performance that brought India back into the match.|$|E
25|$|The {{convoluted}} {{tubes of}} early designs {{such as the}} du Temple and Normand were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> A multi-row bank of tubes could provide adequate heating area, without this complexity. Tubes also became straighter, mostly to ease their cleaning. Yarrow had demonstrated that straight tubes did not cause any problems with expansion, but circular drums and perpendicular tube entry were both valuable features for a long service life. Where tubes entered drums at an angle, heating and cooling tended to bend the tube back and forth, leading to leaks. A perpendicular entry was easier to expand the tubes for a reliable seal and to avoid these sideways stresses. It was worth the compromise of the Admiralty boiler's bent tube ends to keep these two features, and these tubes were still simple enough in shape to clean easily.|$|E
