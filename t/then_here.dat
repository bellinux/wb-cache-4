500|$|In {{the period}} drama The Girl of Your Dreams (La niña de tus ojos), Cruz portrayed Macarena Granada, a singer {{who is in}} an on-and-off {{relationship}} with Antonio Resines's character, Blas. They {{are part of a}} Francoist film troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz's performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of Variety magazine writing [...] "if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first and a pretty face second, <b>then</b> <b>here</b> it is". A writer for Film4 commented that [...] "Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film" [...] but noted that overall the film [...] "looks great". Cruz's role as Macerna has been viewed as her [...] "largest role to date". For her performance, Cruz received a Goya Award and Spanish Actors' Union Award, and was nominated for a European Film Award. In 1999, Cruz worked with Almodóvar again in All About My Mother, playing Sister María Rosa Sanz, a pregnant nun with AIDS. The film received favorable reviews, and was commercially successful, grossing over $67million worldwide, although it performed better at the box office internationally than domestically.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the music}} video began on September 20, 2012, with shots of Jepsen on set of the music video {{surfacing}} online the same day. She was pictured {{wearing a pair of}} leather pants along with a red-black corset and a silver chain hanging from her waist. The singer said she is aiming to show a more mature side with the music video. On October 8, 2012, a 24-second teaser was uploaded to YouTube featuring Jepsen performing the track at a party, falling for a guy in a grey beanie and then jumping into a swimming pool with him for a kiss. Two weeks later, the singer tweeted, [...] "the music video for This Kiss is coming soooo soon! Until <b>then</b> <b>here</b> is a little preview. Hope you enjoy it! Mwah x," [...] followed by the link of the teaser. A lyric video, which [...] "channels the familiar opening credits of the classic show Saved By The Bell" [...] as noted by Carl Williot of Idolator, was released on October 18, 2012. The music video premiered on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Directed by Justin Francis, the video starts with Jepsen and her fellow friends driving a Fiat 500. After they come out of the car, they follow to a '80s inspired warehouse, where Jepsen starts flirting with a guy (actor Kurt Collins). The guy is immediately attracted to her, and, as the video comes to a close, they dive in a pool and kiss.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell {{me that she was}} your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now <b>then,</b> <b>here</b> is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Yulia Latynina, Russian journalist, criticised the Tagliavini report, saying: [...] "A war, {{it turns}} out, is begun by he [...] who {{responds}} to the actions of an aggressor [...] So when Ossetian 'volunteers' burn Georgian villages - {{that is not a}} war. But if they [...] respond to this, <b>then</b> <b>here</b> you, accursed ones, have started a war. Following the logic of the Tagliavini commission, the Georgians ought not to have responded. Even if Russian tanks had reached Tbilisi, and the Georgians had responded, they, the swine, would have started a war. The logic is irreproachable: if the Georgians had not responded, {{there would have been no}} war." [...] Latynina argued that according to the Tagliavini mission [...] "Georgia had no right to send a single shell into the city [...] But the opposite side had a right to burn down Nuli, and that was not an infringement of human rights." [...] Latynina concluded that the commission showed a [...] "cowardice" [...] before [...] "an international hooligan" [...] Vladimir Putin.|$|E
