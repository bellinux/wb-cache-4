25|$|Turnout {{is thought}} to reduce the {{likelihood}} of colic, although this has not been proven. It is recommended that a horse receive ideally 18 hours of grazing time each day, as in the wild. However, many times this is difficult to manage with competition horses and those that are boarded, as well as for animals <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> keepers with access to lush pasture and hence at risk of laminitis. Turnout on a dry lot with lower-quality fodder may have similar beneficial effects.|$|E

The studies found it was important to have containers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to use with little need for training {{to be able to}} use. The containers should be visible in any areas that sharps are used and be placed in such degree that spillage and injury will not be likely to occur with use.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the three}} {{effective}} lengths (good length, bouncer and yorker) are all interspersed by lengths <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> for the batsman to hit, control of length {{is an important}} discipline for a fast bowler. In addition to all the above variables, batsmen control how far out of the crease they face, further complicating the bowler's task of correct length estimation. Spin bowlers {{on the other hand}} are almost always aiming for the good length, but need a much finer control of flight and line to be effective.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have shown}} that this problem is intimately linked {{with the ability to}} parse language, and that those words <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to segment due to their high {{transitional}} probabilities are also easier to map to an appropriate referent. This serves as further evidence of the developmental progression of language acquisition, with children requiring an understanding of the sound distributions of natural languages to form phonetic categories, parse words based on these categories, and then use these parses to map them to objects as labels.|$|E

25|$|Interlingua has no {{explicitly}} defined phonotactics. However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to words <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> for most learners to pronounce. In {{the process of}} forming new words, an ending cannot always be added without a modification of some kind in between. A good example is the plural -s, which is always preceded by a vowel {{to prevent the occurrence}} of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final -s becomes -es.|$|E
25|$|A baler is a {{piece of}} farm {{machinery}} used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, straw, or silage) into compact bales <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to handle, transport and store. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bales – rectangular or cylindrical (round), of various sizes, bound with twine, netting, or wire. The round hay baler was invented by Ummo F. Luebben of Sutton, Nebraska, which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903, and then patented in 1910. The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.|$|E
25|$|Campfires {{have been}} used for cooking since time immemorial. Possibly the {{simplest}} method of cooking over a campfire {{and one of the most}} common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above the flames. This is a popular technique for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making s'mores. This type of cooking over the fire typically consists of comfort foods <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to prepare. There is also no clean up involved unlike an actual kitchen. Another technique is to use pie irons—small iron molds with long handles. Campers put slices of bread with some kind of filling into the molds and put them over hot coals to cook. Campers sometimes use elaborate grills, cast iron pots, and fire irons to cook. Often, however, they use portable stoves for cooking instead of campfires. :For more information, see Campfire cooking.|$|E

500|$|The Force Unleashed is a third-person action game {{in which}} the player's character's weapons are the Force and a lightsaber. Developers treated the main character's lightsaber like another Force power, and wanted to ensure [...] "something visceral and cool" [...] {{happened}} with each button-push. The game has a combo system for stringing lightsaber attacks and for combining lightsaber attacks with Force powers. Experience points earned by killing enemies and finding artifacts {{can be used to}} increase Starkiller's powers and traits. The gameplay is intended to be easy to learn; the development team included [...] "horrible" [...] gamers to help ensure the game's accessibility. Players can casually run and gun through the game, but the game rewards those who take a stealthy, more tactical approach. The game includes enemies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to overcome; game difficulty arises from presenting these enemies in large numbers that can wear down the player's character. Additionally, enemies learn from the player's character's attacks; using the same attack on different characters can sometimes lead to the player's character doing less damage. The enemies, which number over 50, have various strengths and weaknesses; developers faced the difficulty of effectively placing them throughout the game's varied environments.|$|E
