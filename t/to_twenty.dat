5|$|The most {{poisonous}} {{of these}} frogs, the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), has enough toxin on average to kill ten <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> men or about ten thousand mice. Most other dendrobatids, while colorful and toxic enough to discourage predation, pose far less risk to humans or other large animals.|$|E
5|$|The network's name, WIN is a {{reference}} to its original Wollongong station WIN-4, itself an acronym of Wollongong Illawarra New South Wales. Through its news division, WIN News, WIN Television broadcasts a half-hour news service <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> regional markets.|$|E
5|$|A {{script for}} text {{was not used}} by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been {{analysed}} by various authors, such as Joaquín Acosta, Alexander von Humboldt and Liborio Zerda, and appear as rock art and on textiles. The frog {{is the most important}} and is represented in the numbers from one (ata) <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> (gueta) five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglpyhs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; qhicħâ hɣcſcâ.|$|E

5|$|Collegiate teams {{participating}} in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the Peoples Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India. Teams {{range in size from}} several students, up <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> or more. Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, but it may assist the student teams with funding and equipment.|$|E
5|$|For 15,000 years, {{native peoples}} {{gathered}} at Wyam {{to fish and}} exchange goods. They built wooden platforms {{out over the water}} and caught salmon with dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam up through the rapids and jumped over the falls. Historically, an estimated fifteen <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> million salmon passed through the falls every year, {{making it one of the}} greatest fishing sites in North America.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|In April 1918, Haywood and 100 of the arrested IWW members {{began their}} trial, {{presided over by}} Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The trial lasted five months, the longest {{criminal}} trial up to that time; Haywood himself testified for three days. All 101 defendants were found guilty, and Haywood (along with fourteen others) was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> years in prison.|$|E
5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to humans, three primarily terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the archipelago: the Arctic fox, the Svalbard reindeer, and accidentally introduced southern voles, which are {{found only in}} Grumant. Attempts to introduce the Arctic hare and the muskox have both failed. There are fifteen <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|Most of the UCSC {{undergraduate}} {{housing is}} affiliated {{with one of the}} ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas. Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women. Single-gender, gender-neutral and substance-free floors are also available.|$|E

In November, US President Barack Obama raised concerns about the case during a meeting with Hun Sen. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also called for Sonando to be released.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of Manhattan, there were a myriad of Hudson River ferries at one point, with boat routes running from New Jersey <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> {{passenger}} docks in Manhattan. However, the construction of the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, and George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey, as well as the growth of car ownership in the United States, meant that these ferries were no longer needed by the mid-20th century. As a result, in 1967, the last cross-Hudson ferry (between Hoboken and Battery Park City) ceased operations.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> minutes later; it would then take a further five <b>to</b> <b>twenty</b> minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E
50|$|In {{the village}} {{there was no}} electricity, tap water or {{sanitation}} but the new community of inhabitants grew from the small original nucleus <b>to</b> around <b>twenty</b> <b>to</b> thirty people by 1968, mostly hippie artists coming from all over Europe (Italian, Austrian, English, French, Danish, German and Swedish).|$|R
