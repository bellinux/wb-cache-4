3000|$|... [*]Selective repeat (SR) ARQ. Unlike SW ARQ, {{when using}} SR ARQ, packets are {{transmitted}} continuously by the sender. As before, the receiver acknowledges each successfully received packet by transmitting an ACK bearing the sequence {{number of the}} packet being acknowledged. If an acknowledgment is not received for a packet before the expiration of the timeout, the packet is retransmitted. Once a packet has been retransmitted, the sender resumes transmission of packets from where it is left off, i.e., if a[*]is the packet with the largest sequence number that has been transmitted, packet with sequence number a[*]+[*] 1 is transmitted next. Here, we assume that no other <b>timers</b> <b>have</b> <b>expired</b> in the meantime. Since the SR ARQ protocol is employed, packets are continuously being transmitted and the inefficiency associated with SW ARQ is eliminated. Observe that when SR ARQ is employed, packets can be accepted out of sequence. Hence, packets received out of sequence have to be buffered and sequenced {{before they can be}} delivered.|$|R

Therefore, the signal {{at the end of the}} last block of a GT section may be flashing red to indicate that the <b>timer</b> <b>has</b> not yet run out, but that location will never have a lunar aspect since the next block is not subject to GT.|$|R

50|$|All {{stations}} in the IBSS compete for beacon transmission every aBeaconPeriod time units. This time period is called a beacon period (BP). At {{the beginning of each}} BP, there is a beacon generation window consisting of w + 1 slots each of length aSlotTime. Each station calculates a random delay uniformly distributed in w and is scheduled to transmit a beacon when the delay timer expires. If a beacon arrives before the random delay <b>timer</b> <b>has</b> <b>expired,</b> the station cancels the pending beacon transmission and the remaining random delay. Upon receiving a beacon, a station sets its TSF timer to the timestamp of the beacon if the value of the timestamp is later than the station’s TSF timer.|$|E

50|$|In the European Union, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and Ofcom permit TV {{white space}} {{operation}} in 8 MHz channels between 490 and 790 MHz, with the GDB granting use {{for up to}} 2 hours. The allowed transmit power is dynamically set on a per-station basis, based on factors including the geographical distance to the next primary user in the given frequency. This closed-loop scheme requires each station to report its position after a <b>timer</b> <b>has</b> <b>expired</b> or it has moved 50 m or more, and to stop transmitting within 5 s when instructed to do so. Compared to the open-loop scheme used by the FCC, the closed-loop scheme used by the ETSI and Ofcom is more granular and allows for a more efficient spectrum utilization.|$|E

30|$|When the <b>timer</b> <b>has</b> <b>expired,</b> {{the relay}} node is {{expected}} to broadcast a channel reservation message to neighboring relays to prevent other relays from transmission. The relay whose timer expired first broadcasts a channel reservation message to the neighbors. Contrast to [12], in our model, {{we do not need}} to consider the channel between the source and the relay node since only the relay performs retransmission. This will reduce processing delay in relay node selection. Based on this idea, we propose a new distributed relay node selection algorithm combined with OPNC for the topology of multiple relays and multiple sink nodes. If we use channel state as the only variable to choose a relay node as in the opportunistic relaying algorithm, the system performance may be poor.|$|E
40|$|As DIS {{exercises}} are scaled up, {{it has been}} estimated that a large portion of entity state traffic will be due to the transmit timeout, also known as the "heartbeat" or "keep alive". These updates that are sent because a protocol <b>timer</b> <b>has</b> <b>expired,</b> not because there is new information to communicate. This redundant traffic wastes processing and communication resources and is one factor that limits the scaleability of the DIS protocol. This paper explores three approaches to eliminating these redundant transmissions and has significant implications for the DIS protocols as well as the distributed simulation architecture. 1. INTRODUCTION Simulations participating in a distributed simulation exercise must share a consistent view of the simulated world state. The shared state must be consistent across simulations, within some tolerance, despite data lost in transmission. Additionally, mechanisms must exist to permit simulations joining an exercise already in progress to acquire a consist [...] ...|$|E
