Mara had run the day-to-day operations under Bob Tisch's supervision in the years leading up to his father's death. Forbes magazine estimates the 2010 value of the team at $1.183 billion. This ranks them fourth in the 30 team league in terms of value.

Operating revenue was $26.7 million, and player salary was $97 million.

40|$|Array Display Tool (ADT) is a Motif {{program to}} display arrays of process {{variables}} from the Advanced Photon Source control system. A typical use is {{to display the}} horizontal and vertical monitor readings. A picture of the ADT interface is here. The screen layout, apart from the menu bar, consists of two types of graphic areas in which the values for the arrays of process variables are shown: Display areas, which display one or more arrays {{as a function of}} index, and a zoom area. In the zoom area specified arrays only are displayed as a function of lattice position along with symbols for the major elements of the lattice. There can be several display areas, but at most one zoom area. When the screen is resized these areas change size proportionally. There are a number of options in the View Menu to change the way the values are displayed. It is also possible via the Options Menu to: (1) Store <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>values</b> internally. (2) Store the values from a snapshot file internally. (3) Display one of the stored sets of <b>values</b> along with <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>values.</b> (4) Display <b>the</b> difference of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>values</b> with one of the stored sets of <b>values.</b> (5) Write <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>values</b> to a snapshot file.

40|$|Orbitscreen is a Motif {{program to}} display arrays of process {{variables}} from the Advanced Photon Source control system. Although, in principal, any two arrays of process variables may be displayed, {{the most common}} use is to display the horizontal and vertical monitor readings. There are three display areas in the interface, {{one for each of}} the arrays and a zoom area. In the zoom area both arrays can be displayed at once along with symbols for the major elements of the lattice. There are a number of options to customize the way the values are displayed. It is also possible to: (1) store <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>values</b> internally; (2) store the values from a snapshot file internally; (3) display one of the stored sets of <b>values</b> along with <b>the</b> <b>current</b> values; (4) display the difference of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>values</b> with one of the stored sets of values; and (5) write <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>values</b> to a snapshot file.
