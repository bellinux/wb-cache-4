50|$|<b>Trimethobenzamide</b> (trade names Tebamide, Tigan) is an {{antiemetic}} used {{to prevent}} nausea and vomiting. It is often prescribed for patients with gastroenteritis, medication-induced nausea, and other illnesses. <b>Trimethobenzamide</b> is generally considered the most potent antiemetic {{that does not have}} effects on the serotonergic, dopaminergic, or histaminergic systems, so it has a lower likelihood of causing undesired side effects. In the United States, it requires a prescription.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trimethobenzamide</b> is marketed {{under the}} brand names Tebamide and Tigan, {{manufactured}} by GlaxoSmithKline and King Pharmaceuticals, respectively. It is available as oral capsules and injectable formulations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimethobenzamide</b> is an {{antagonist}} of the D2 receptor. It {{is believed}} to affect the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the medulla oblongata to suppress nausea and vomiting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimethobenzamide</b> {{was also}} {{available}} as a rectal suppository, but such formulations were banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on April 6, 2007 due to unproven efficacy.|$|E
50|$|Alkylation of {{the sodium}} salt of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (1) with 2-dimethylaminoethyl {{chloride}} affords the ether (2). Reductive amination of the aldehyde {{in the presence of}} ammonia gives diamine (3). Acylation of that product with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride affords <b>trimethobenzamide</b> (4).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} temperature on the toxicity of cyclizine, <b>trimethobenzamide,</b> and Aspirin were studied in mice. LD- 50 s were compared at 30 C, 22 C, and 15 C. At 30 C the toxicity {{of all three}} drugs increased, with that to Aspirin being affected most. Cooling decreased the toxicity of cyclizine and had no significant effect on that of <b>trimethobenzamide</b> or aspirin. These findings indicate that alterations in environmental temperature markedly affect drug toxicity. They emphasize that such alterations, and particularly increases in temperature, {{do not have to}} be particularly drastic, but that 'mild' variations in the environment are effective in altering an animal's sensitivity to a drug...|$|E
40|$|Six benzamides {{could be}} {{detected}} by gas chromatography with surface ionization detection (GC-SID) with high sensitivity. They were classified into two groups, a higher response group (Group I: tiapride, bromopride and metoclopramide) {{and a lower}} response group (Group II: sultopride, <b>trimethobenzamide</b> and nemonapride). The detection limits were 0. 02 to 0. 17 pmol on column (1 to 8. 5 pmol/ml) in Group I drugs and 0. 2 to 0. 9 pmol on column (10 to 45 pmol/ml) in Group II drugs. Sep-Pak C 18 cartridges were used for rapid extraction of benzamides from human whole blood and urine. and their recoveries were above 90 %. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Central {{nervous system}} stimulants, {{tranquillizers}} and other {{central nervous system}} depressants, antiemetics, antihistamine drugs and autonomic blocking agents were examined {{for their ability to}} prevent the pecking response in pigeons induced by apomorphine (250 μg/kg intramuscularly). Reduction in the proportion of positive responses or significant increase in the latent period of pecking were taken as the criterion of effectiveness. Protection was afforded by caffeine, lysergic acid diethylamide, morphine, rauwolscine, triflupromazine and yohimbine. In addition, a significant increase in latent period was produced by artane, pentobarbitone, benactyzine, 2 -bromolysergic acid diethylamide, cyclizine, diphenhydramine, ergotoxine, hyoscine, promethazine, 5 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 4 -methylthiazole and <b>trimethobenzamide.</b> Most of these drugs influenced the pecking and emetic responses to apomorphine in an identical manner. It is possible that identical receptors may be concerned with apomorphine pecking (in pigeons) and emesis (in other species) ...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} vehicle injections from intraperitoneal injections of 3 μg/kg caerulein, a cholecystokinin (CCK) neuropeptide analog. The reward that reinforced correct choices was an electrical brain stimulation self-administered by bar pressing. Dose-response quantitative generalization was obtained by using 1 and 2 μg/kg caerulein. Qualitative generalization to the vehicle occurred after injecting 10, 20 and 200 μg/kg unsulfated CCK- 8, 10, 20 and 200 μg/kg CCK- 4, 5 μg/kg CCK- 8 and 1 μg/kg caerulein, neurotensin or bombesin and 200 μg/kg apomorphine or 320 μg/kg amphetamine. Total generalization to the caerulein cue was obtained with 20 μg/kg sulfated CCK- 8 or gastrin 2 - 17, 25 μg/kg somatostatin, 50 μg/kg haloperidol and 2 mg/kg chlorpromazine. The previous 5 mg/kg injection of an antiemetic drug such as chlorhydrate of <b>trimethobenzamide</b> did not eliminate the discriminative properties of a subsequent injection of caerulein. Our data thus tend to show that IP injection of caerulein produces effects {{similar to those of}} IP neuroleptics. © 1988. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|RU 24969 was {{administered}} s. c. to cats {{and found to}} elicit emesis with a maximally effective dose of 1. 0 mg/kg 5 -Methoxytryptamine {{was found to have}} lower efficacy and to produce a higher incidence of nonspecific effects while trifluoromethylphenylpiperizine (TFMPP) was devoid of emetic effects. The emesis elicited by 1. 0 mg/kg of RU 24969 was not altered by pretreatment with phentolamine, haloperidol, yohimbine or (-) -propranolol, indicating that catecholamines played no role in this response. The emesis was prevented by metergoline and methysergide but not by ketanserin, cyproheptadine, mesulergine, ICS 205 930, methiothepin, <b>trimethobenzamide</b> or BMY 7378. An indirect argument is presented that implicates a role for 5 -HT 1 D sites. This conclusion must remain tentative until drugs selective for this site are synthesized and tested. The emesis was also prevented by 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamine) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), confirming that this drug has a general antiemetic effect in cats...|$|E
