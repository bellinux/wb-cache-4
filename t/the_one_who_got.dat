The episode featured a guest appearance by John Larroquette as Frank Beckerson, the long-lost love of Leslie's mother, Marlene Knope. When Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels announced the casting in January 2010, he described Larroquette's character as [...] "He's <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>got</b> away."

500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{introduced}} an ongoing storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian {{character in the}} Showtime series The L Word, said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: [...] "A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I think everybody wanted to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>got</b> to do it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, [...] "I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?" [...] Delany {{said she did not}} know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives.|$|E
500|$|On September 19, 1975, the Ramones {{recorded}} a demo at 914 Sound Studios, which {{was produced by}} Marty Thau. Featuring the songs [...] "Judy Is a Punk" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", the band used the demo to showcase their style to prospective labels. Producer Craig Leon, who had seen the Ramones perform {{in the summer of}} 1975, brought the demo to the attention of Sire Records' president Seymour Stein. After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife Linda Stein, the Ramones auditioned at Sire and were offered a contract, although the label had previously signed only European progressive rock bands. Drummer Tommy Ramone recalled: [...] "Craig Leon is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>got</b> us signed, single handed. He brought down the vice president and all these people—he's the only hip one in the company. He risked his career to get us on the label." [...] The label offered to release [...] "You're Gonna Kill That Girl" [...] as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album. Sire accepted their request and agreed to release a studio album instead.|$|E

5000|$|The heroines in McKinley's books reflect certain {{qualities that}} she saw in herself as a young woman: clumsiness, plainness, bookishness, and disinterest in the usual social games that involve flirting and dating. She has said, [...] "I didn't {{discover}} boys because they didn't discover me, and because their standards of discovery seemed to me too odd to be aspired to.

5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant {{to have some of}} their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters.

60|$|The Oude bands seldom {{went out}} of their own country, but they did a {{thriving}} business within its borders. So did outside bands who came in and helped.
