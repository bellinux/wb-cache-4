5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in <b>the</b> <b>foreground.</b> The shot was an in-camera matte shot. <b>The</b> <b>foreground</b> was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of}} the mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new implementation of the FastICA algorithm on simulated LOFAR EoR data {{with the aim of}} accurately removing <b>the</b> <b>foregrounds</b> and extracting <b>the</b> 21 -cm reionization signal. We find that the method successfully removes <b>the</b> <b>foregrounds</b> with an average fitting error of 0. 5 per cent and that the 2 D and 3 D power spectra are recovered across the frequency range. We find that for scales above several PSF scales the 21 -cm variance is successfully recovered though there is evidence of noise leakage into <b>the</b> reconstructed <b>foreground</b> components. We find that this blind independent component analysis technique provides encouraging results without the danger of prior foreground assumptions.

5|$|The {{film was}} an early example of efforts to move beyond theater {{blocking}} conventions. During the police raid, depth was demonstrated by having action take place in both <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> and the background, and by allowing actors to move between them. This cinematography technique improved the realism and pacing of the scene.|$|E

40|$|<b>Foreground</b> removal is <b>the</b> most {{important}} step in detecting the large-scale redshifted HI 21 -cm signal. Modelling foreground spectra is challenging and is further complicated by the chromatic response of the telescope. We present a multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) estimator {{for use in a}} survey for redshifted HI 21 -cm emission from z~ 3. 35, and demonstrate its ability to accurately characterize <b>the</b> <b>foregrounds.</b> This survey will be carried out with the two wide-field interferometer modes of the upgraded Ooty Radio Telescope, called the Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA), at 326. 5 MHz. We have tailored the two-visibility correlation for OWFA to estimate the MAPS and test it with simulated <b>foregrounds.</b> In <b>the</b> process, we describe a software model that encodes the geometry and the details of the telescope, and simulates a realistic model for the bright radio sky. This article presents simulations which include the full chromatic response of the telescope, in addition to the frequency dependence intrinsic to <b>the</b> <b>foregrounds.</b> We find that the visibility correlation MAPS estimator recovers the input angular power spectrum accurately, and that the instrument response to <b>the</b> <b>foregrounds</b> dominates <b>the</b> systematic errors in <b>the</b> recovered <b>foreground</b> power spectra.

5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in <b>the</b> <b>foreground,</b> creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
