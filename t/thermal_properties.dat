40|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>property</b> of {{closed-cell}} aluminum foam is studied numerically and {{the effects}} of the distribution of the circular pore on the <b>thermal</b> <b>property</b> are studied theoretically. When the convection and radiation are ignored, the effects of porosity, cell size, and distribution forms of pore on the apparent thermal conductivity are investigated. Moreover, the effects of air in the pore on the <b>thermal</b> <b>property</b> are analyzed as well. Simulation results show that apparent thermal conductivity linearly increases with the increase of porosity, while the cell size and the distribution have negligible effects on the <b>thermal</b> <b>property.</b> By comparison, <b>thermal</b> conductivity of air has slight effect on <b>thermal</b> <b>property</b> of foamed aluminum in the context of small size pore...|$|R

5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties.

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the theory}} of the <b>thermal</b> {{conductive}} <b>properties</b> of wood, higher densities and lower porosities increase the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> of wood [9, 14].

30|$|<b>Thermal</b> {{conductive}} <b>properties</b> {{may also}} {{be responsible for the}} differences between heartwood and sapwood. The higher proportions of heartwood of Douglas fir (100  %) and Japanese cedar (> 75  %) recorded higher <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties,</b> which may indicate that the chemical substances in heartwood increase the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties.</b> MacLean and others [9, 24, 25] deduced that chemical substances in the heartwood such as tannin, resin or oil possibly increase the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{anisotropy}} on the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> of wood {{is a highly}} controversial topic. Some scientists claim that the thermal conductive values in the radial direction are {{higher than in the}} tangential direction [5, 17, 26], whereas others report the same <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> in both transverse directions [8, 9, 20]. However, most importantly, the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> are mainly dependent on the pattern of the growth ring itself at low temperatures. In the case of Douglas fir, the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> in the radial direction are higher than in the tangential direction. However, in contrast with Douglas fir, similar <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> in the tangential and radial directions were obtained for moderate-diameter wood, which comprises partly tangential and partly radial directions. Consequently, this combination of both transverse directions influences the anisotropic factor of the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> in this study. Furthermore, the orientation of the microfibrils strongly affects the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties.</b> A number of other studies have reported that the <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>properties</b> of wood increase with increasing ring angle which is influenced by the microfibril angle in the S 2 layers of the cell walls [5, 26, 27].|$|R
