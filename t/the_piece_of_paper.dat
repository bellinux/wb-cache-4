25|$|Due to {{the varying}} {{accounts}} and hadiths on {{the collection and}} canonization of the Quran, some scholars debate whether the 'Uthmanic text comprehends the entire body of material that was revealed to Muhammad, or {{if there has been}} material that is missing from the 'Uthmanic text. For example, some Sunni literature contains reports that suggest that some of the revelations had already been lost before the collection of the Quran initiated by Abu Bakr. In one version of a report at the time, 'Umar was once looking for the text of a specific verse of the Quran on stoning as a punishment for adultery, which he remembered. Later, he discovered that the only person who had any record of that verse had been killed in the battle of Yamama and as a result the verse was lost. Later, some of the Companions recalled that same verse, one person being 'A'isha, Muhammad's youngest wife. She is believed to have said that a sheet on which two verses, including the one on stoning, were under her bedding and that after Muhammad died, a domestic animal got into the room and gobbled up the sheet. Experts on hadith literature have rejected this hadith, as all routes of transmission either contain narrators charged with dishonesty in disclosing sources or simply conflict with the majority version of the report, which all have authentic routes of transmission but omit the part about <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> being eaten.|$|E
25|$|Lange {{began the}} new decade {{in the light}} romp How to Beat the High Co$t of Living (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it {{received}} mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which {{he was working with}} Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for Goin' South (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with her name on it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, the {{original}} handwritten lyrics {{for the song}} were nearly auctioned off at Christie's in London. The sheet of notepaper with the scrawled lyrics had been expected to fetch up to £80,000 at the auction, which was scheduled for 30 April 2002. McCartney went to court to stop the auction, claiming the paper had disappeared from his West London home. Richard Morgan, representing Christie's, said McCartney had provided no evidence that he had ever owned <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> on which the lyrics were written. The courts decided in McCartney's favour and prohibited {{the sale of the}} lyrics. They had been sent to Christie's for auction by Frenchman Florrent Tessier, who said he purchased <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> at a street market stall in London for £10 in the early 1970s. In {{the original}} catalogue for the auction, Julian Lennon had written, [...] "It's very strange to think that someone has written a song about you. It still touches me." ...|$|E
500|$|Rebbes {{traditionally}} devote their utmost {{attention to}} reading kvitelach.

The Satmar Rebbe, Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, was known to scrutinize each kvitel and point out errors {{in the writing of}} names of people he had never met.|$|E

Booth {{stated that}} he would never have asked for a ten-percent {{commission}} on the Birmingham contract, and that he had never claimed he could influence government ministers. Hastings showed the jury that both of these statements were lies, first by showing <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> Booth had scribbled the [...] "Birmingham contract" [...] memo on and then by showing a telegram from Booth to Gruban in which Booth claimed that he [...] " [...] already spoken to a Cabinet Minister and high official".|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme of}} the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is that one should live life to the full and have no regrets when it ends.

The book was missing the words [...] "Tamám Shud" [...] on the last page, which had a blank reverse, and microscopic tests indicated that <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> was from the page torn from the book.|$|E

Number 17 is where the Banks family lives: George and Winifred Banks, their two naughty children Jane and Michael, their cook, Mrs. Brill and their odd-job man, Robertson Ay. Things are not going well for Jane and Michael. They {{are out of control}} and, as the show starts, their latest nanny, Katie Nanna, storms out. After that, Mrs. Brill and Robertson Ay complain about living in a [...] "madhouse."

2500|$|On 30 June 1882, {{the day of}} the {{execution}} of Guiteau for the assassination of President James Garfield, Guiteau announced, after famously dancing his way to the gallows, that he would read a poem that he had written. Guiteau said that he had written the poem, which was entitled [...] "I am Going to the Lordy", at about 10:00a.m. Eastern Standard Time that day. After [...] "stubbing his toe {{on the way to the}} gallows", as he put it to {{the execution}}er, Guiteau read [...] and announced that he would now read a prayer of his own composition. After paraphrasing , Guiteau proceeded to read the poem from a piece of paper in a style described as both [...] "sad and doleful" [...] as well as [...] "high pitched" [...] and [...] "childlike". Guiteau had requested an orchestra to play behind him as he recited his poem, but his request was denied. After completing the first verse in song, Guiteau stopped singing and chanted the rest. Multiple times during the reading, Guiteau's voice would fail and he would begin sobbing, even stopping to lay his head on the shoulder of a man standing by him. Right before the completion of the poem, Guiteau raised his voice even higher into falsetto to deliver the final two lines. As the executioner fitted the hood over Guiteau's head and put the rope around his neck, he held onto <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> on which he had written his poem. As per request with the executioner, Guiteau signaled that he was ready to die by dropping the paper.|$|E
40|$|This essay, written around 1779, {{challenges}} the simple quantity theory of money. From the perspective <b>of</b> the <b>paper</b> money issued {{to pay for}} American's Revolutionary War [...] bills of credit, or continentals [...] the essay rejects {{the idea that the}} value of money is determined by <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> issued. That idea ignores the fact that an individual nation is just {{a small part of the}} world economy. More relevant than quantity, the essay argues, are two other features: the date the government promises to exchange <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> for specie and the credibility of that promise. This essay originally appeared in a 1791 Philadelphia newspaper. The version reprinted in this journal is the edited and annotated version from The <b>Papers</b> <b>of</b> James Madison (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962). It is reprinted with the permission of the University of Chicago Press. Money...|$|R
