There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith's S-Force. Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome {{on the heels of the}} advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{testified to}} a closed federal court {{that the moral}} {{philosophy}} of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, emphasizing his belief in individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the Industrial Employment Review Board, which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City. Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with Herbert T. Rosenfeld, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the American Technion Societya Zionist group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons {{a job with the}} Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them. In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld's offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of <b>technical</b> <b>documents</b> reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.|$|E

25|$|Then, in 1996, Crichton {{published}} Airframe, an aero-techno-thriller which {{relates the}} story of a quality assurance vice-president at the fictional aerospace manufacturer Norton Aircraft, as she investigates an in-flight accident aboard a Norton-manufactured airliner that leaves three passengers dead and fifty-six injured. Again, Crichton uses the false document literary device, presenting numerous <b>technical</b> <b>documents</b> {{to create a sense of}} authenticity. In the novel, Crichton draws from real life accidents to increase its sensation of realism, including American Airlines Flight 191 and Aeroflot Flight 593; the latter flew from Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport and crashed on its way to Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport in 1994. Crichton challenges the public perception of air safety and the consequences of exaggerated media reports to sell the story. The book also continues Crichton's overall theme of the failure of humans in human-machine interaction, given that the plane itself worked perfectly and the accident would not have occurred had the pilot reacted properly.|$|E
25|$|In September 2002, Roark {{and three}} former NSA officials, William Binney, J.

Roark tried to notify her superior, then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Porter Goss. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time. In addition, Roark {{made an effort to}} inform Vice President Dick Cheney's legal counsel David Addington, who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s. Addington was later revealed by a Washington Post report to be the author of the controlling legal and <b>technical</b> <b>documents</b> for the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program, typing the documents on a Tempest-shielded computer across from his desk in room 268 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and storing them in a vault in his office.

25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore <b>technical</b> <b>documents)</b> so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Company X is a {{manufacturing}} company that assembles four wheeled vehicles in Indonesia. The company uses <b>technical</b> <b>document</b> as an instruction tool for parts modification. The document is sent from the principal company abroad to Company X and will firstly receive by Engineering Division and {{flow through the}} other divisions in the company. The distribution of the <b>technical</b> <b>document</b> will be end in the suppliers which must {{be involved in the}} process since they must supply the parts to the company. A preliminary study has been conducted and the results showed that the actual lead time of <b>technical</b> <b>document</b> information flow is 51 days which longer than the ideal lead time (11 days) set by management. The root causes of the problem are there no common data which can be used by all divisions and lack of control over the administrative process. We recommend the company to build an integrated <b>technical</b> <b>document</b> control system so the <b>technical</b> <b>document</b> distribution process will be better and receive by suppliers on time. Based on the recommendation, it is necessary to shift the process from manual business process to integrated business process. The aim of this research is to propose an integrated distribution system of <b>technical</b> <b>document</b> in Company X using Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Best Practices. First, we mapped the existing business process of each divisions using flow diagram. Then we reengineer the business process using BPR Best Practices. Next, a simulation model is built based on the new business process to determine the distribution lead time. In the Final step, we evaluate the proposed business process using SWOT-AHP. Based on the simulation, it is found that the proposed business process can reduce the distribution lead time by 99. 94 %...|$|R
