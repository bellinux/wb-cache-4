500|$|Like {{the other}} Romanov children, Tatiana was raised with some austerity. She {{and her sisters}} slept on camp beds without pillows, took cold baths in the morning, and were {{expected}} to keep themselves occupied with embroidery or knitting projects {{if they had a}} spare moment. Their work was given as gifts or sold at charity bazaars. According to one story, Tatiana, accustomed to being addressed only by her name and patronymic, was so disconcerted when she was addressed as [...] "Your Imperial Highness" [...] by lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden when she was heading a committee meeting that she kicked the woman under the table and hissed [...] "Are you crazy <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} article was published, an agent {{suggested}} that Ortved write a full book. They put together a proposal and shopped it to several publishers, before being signed by Faber and Faber. According to Ortved, [...] "When word of this got out, Brooks {{sent a letter to}} every current Simpsons employee, and all the former ones he thought mattered, asking them not <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The writers’ agents sent denial after denial for interview requests and eventually stopped responding altogether." [...] He added, [...] "There was one 'D'oh!' in James L. Brooks and the Gracie Films master plan: Many people don’t like James L. Brooks. [...] The book I ended up writing quotes more than 75 sources—some of them Simpsons staffers, former and current, who opened up because they considered his and Matt Groening’s attempt to stomp on my project very 'un-Simpsons.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{bittersweet}} {{moment in}} Cobb's life reportedly {{came in the}} late 1940s, when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the Masters golf tournament. Stopping at a Greenville, South Carolina, liquor store, Cobb noticed that {{the man behind the}} counter was none other than [...] "Shoeless" [...] Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the Black Sox scandal. But Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and after making his purchase an incredulous Cobb asked, [...] "Don't you know me, Joe?" [...] "I know you", replied Jackson, [...] "but I wasn't sure you wanted <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> A lot of them don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{here you}} are again!" [...] she said in querulous tones as he entered, [...] "after being nearly the death of me with your wicked goings on! I don't know what you will come <b>to,</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as you did yesterday, and then running away and {{stopping}} out all night." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 3 October 1870: [...] "Louise {{had gone}} with Janie, E., the Lord Chancellor, & Lord Lorne to Loch Muich & the Glassalt. They {{returned}} some time after I got home, & Louise came <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> & tell me, that while walking up to the Dhu Loch, Lord Lorne had told her of his feelings for her & had in fact proposed to her, & Knowing that I would approve & liked him, she had accepted him. I embraced her & gave her my blessing, but felt greatly agitated. I was not unprepared but did not expect it would come so quick. Of course nothing can be said till Lorne has heard from his Parents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte de Sauve {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as a source}} of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops. In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: [...] "Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them [...] {{in such a way that}} they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: [...] "The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [...] and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [...] <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, and I want to be one jump ahead of them". On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.|$|E
2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I confess I find great {{difficulty}} in following you. I {{should like to}} hear William's side of the story," [...] he said irritably. [...] "I think he ought <b>to</b> have <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the first instance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Chaka {{looked at}} me strangely. [...] "Thou art a bold man who darest <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> thus <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Mopo," [...] he said. [...] "Dost thou not {{know that it is}} sacrilege to touch an Isanusi?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{care not}} what he is," [...] said Roland Graeme; [...] "I will teach whomever I <b>speak</b> with <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> civilly <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in return. I {{did not come from}} Avenel to be browbeaten in Holyrood." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'What is it, my friend? I {{will not}} claim with you my abbot's {{right to know}} the secrets of your heart: but surely that breast hides nothing which is unworthy <b>to</b> be <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> however unworthy I may be to hear it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{this the}} answer that I am to take back to Hokosa?" [...] asked Noma. [...] "It will {{scarcely}} bind him to your cause, Prince, and I wonder that you dare <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> who am his wife." ...|$|R

60|$|He loves <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> French <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He {{holds his}} chin and waits, in his anxiety for the phrase to come. Then it stammers forth, a little rush, ending in Italian. But his pride is all on edge: we must {{continue}} in French.|$|R
