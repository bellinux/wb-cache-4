Nick is getting fed up with living in his ghastly flat and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a way to move back into the family home. The gap between Michael's IQ {{and the rest of the}} family's seems to be increasing, but so is his libido. And Abi is still Abi, only more so! As for perennially put-upon Ben, what with a new arrival causing chaos in the surgery, being forced to take tango lessons and being officially {{declared}} dead, life is just one long major-league cirsis.|$|E

500|$|This is {{the only}} episode {{that does not have}} [...] "the" [...] in the title. A {{decision}} was made to name all the episodes in this way so that the writers would not waste time <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of funny titles and instead make the content of the episode funny. However, this decision was made after the script for [...] "Male Unbonding" [...] was completed. Jerry Seinfeld tried to have the title of the episode changed to [...] "The Male Unbonding" [...] some time later, but was unsuccessful.|$|E

Moving on to For Your Eyes Only, Fleming said [...] "I am busily scratching my head <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a subject for you again.

500|$|In {{the scene}} where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without {{answering}} the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, [...] "Dammit, children, why do I {{always have to be}} the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.|$|E
500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, I just started playing the riff in sound-check one day, and then we all started playing it, and then we started playing it live, and then we figured we'd record {{it and put it}} out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} A Flash Flood of Colour is {{politically}} progressive. The album's treatment of current affairs {{and environmental issues}} takes aim [...] "at the failings of capitalism, the hypocrisy of modern politics and the blatant disregard of human health and happiness" [...] and {{has been compared to}} the calculated approach of the Occupy movement, rather than an ensuing class conflict. Despite its political themes, Reynolds denied that the album was politically motivated: [...] "This album is anti-politics. We say that politics is an outdated system. It is time that we embrace technological developments and no longer have to rely on a rule. Our lives should develop according to scientific findings." [...] He described A Flash Flood of Colours recurring theme as [...] "perspective": [...] "We're not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> subjectively." [...] The Real News, Democracy Now! and journalist John Pilger have all influenced Reynolds' political views.|$|E

500|$|Rogen {{commented that}} he and Goldberg wanted to show with the episode how Hollywood {{generally}} ruins superhero films. He said that [...] "the whole joke is that Homer is cast to play a guy who's an everyman and {{they try to make}} him into this physically fit guy." [...] Rogen also noted that the plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet, when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role. Show runner Al Jean commented that the writers tried not to repeat the comic book film theme from the [...] "Radioactive Man" [...] episode. Instead they decided to parody the fact that almost every comic book {{has been turned into a}} film. Jean commented that that scene in the episode in which the studio executives [...] "are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> up an idea that hasn't been done really is what they are doing these days [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira's {{record label}} at that time, Epic Records, opposed the {{decision}} to release and commission Laundry Service as they [...] "wanted her just to throw a couple of songs in English on a Latin record." [...] Estefan argued with Tommy Mottola, then head of Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Epic Records), and convinced him to release the album, arguing that an [...] "American audience" [...] would not buy a Spanish record simply due to its inclusion of a few English tracks. In an interview with Latina, she said [...] "I got in the trenches there with Tommy [...] - I fought for that. Because they didn't believe it. Just like they told us [...] They were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in the box and I wanted to take {{her out of the}} box. And fortunately, Tommy, whom I love and adore and is a good friend, he really listened to me." ...|$|E
500|$|From June to August 2003, {{the group}} {{was part of the}} Warped Tour. Reyes {{contacted}} his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's place; on August 5, it was announced that Mascherino {{was a member of the}} band. Bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with O'Connell, then joined the group. Rubano was asked to audition by O'Connell but was initially hesitant, since he was not a fan of emo music or aware of the band; however, he bought the album and learned Cooper's parts. On September 16, [...] "You're So Last Summer" [...] was released as a radio single. From September to November Taking Back Sunday co-headlined a tour with Saves the Day, supported by Moneen. In November, a music video for [...] "You're So Last Summer" [...] was filmed at Fulton State Park in New York. The video, directed by Winters, debuted on MTV on November 24. In the video, the band plays while Public Enemy vocalist Flavor Flav (in full regalia) jumps. According to Lazzara, {{the group was}} making fun of itself: [...] "We had two guys leave our band and there were two main singers, so we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a way to bring the new band members into the video, but not have Fred singing the old guy’s part. And the funniest way to do that was to use Flavor Flav." ...|$|E

500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
500|$|After the Dubai World Cup, California Chrome {{was shipped}} to Rae Guest's Newmarket stables in England {{to prepare for}} Royal Ascot week in June. The {{decision}} to go to England was made by Perry Martin, against the wishes of both Coburn and Sherman. Martin explained, [...] "I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in terms of what's best for the horse. It was my decision to send him to Newmarket. It's a beautiful place, with trees and pastures for gallops...It's good for his mind. I know Art didn't take the decision well. But he'll be okay." [...] The horse's exercise rider in England, Robbie Mills, who was acquainted with the Shermans and advised them to stable the horse with Guest, stated that California Chrome was making a good transition from the flat dirt tracks of the United States to the undulating turf gallops of England. The horse was pointed to the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, with European jockey William Buick, who rode Prince Bishop in Dubai, tapped to ride. The day before the race, the horse was scratched because of a bruised hoof that was draining pus. Guest stated, [...] "He's been X-rayed and there's no damage." [...] Martin wanted to run him in Chicago's Arlington Million in August, and the requirements of quarantine upon his return to the United States combined with the setback to his training foreclosed any other UK start. [...] Upon California Chrome's return to the US in early July, a veterinary radiograph revealed that he had bruising on his cannon bones that would require at least three months to heal, effectively ending his four-year-old season. The veterinarians at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Kentucky explained, [...] "California Chrome's x-rays showed all of his joints to be remarkably clean. He has the early signs of bruising {{to the bottom of the}} cannon bones...The return rate for horses with this problem is very high...we found that recovery rate was 95% after giving time in the paddock to heal." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{starting}} {{out as a}} comedy writer, Appel recalled: [...] "One reason I caught up to my contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the Lampoon, even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use." [...] Appel got his first television job when David Mirkin hired him for the writing staff of The Simpsons in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract, {{and served as a}} writer and producer there for four years. There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of [...] "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time." [...] Appel found work on The Simpsons to be a learning curve because it was a [...] "very tough show to write for." [...] His first episode was season seven's [...] "Mother Simpson". Appel was desperately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her Mona Simpson, after his wife. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Also for season seven he penned [...] "Bart on the Road", in which he utilized the plot devices of [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driving license, and contributed to the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about Marge, the other about Lionel Hutz) were both cut. Appel wrote two episodes from season eight, [...] "Bart After Dark" [...] and [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", as well as season nine's [...] "The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] and season 10's [...] "When You Dish Upon A Star".|$|E
