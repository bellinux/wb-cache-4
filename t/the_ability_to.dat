5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> process and manipulate information held in working memory, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> think about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action.

5|$|There are {{numerous}} traditions and stories {{associated with the}} flag, most of which deal with its magical properties and mysterious origins.

The various powers attributed to the Fairy Flag include: <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> multiply a clan's military forces; <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> save the lives of certain clanfolk; <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> cure a plague on cattle; <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> increase the chances of fertility; and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bring herring into the loch at Dunvegan.

5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use a unique carbon source, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> take upon a particular ecological niche, or <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, {{making it possible to}} determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> retain energy while hopping, colour vision and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described as <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation {{at one point in}} time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
