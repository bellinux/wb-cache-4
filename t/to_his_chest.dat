While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the finish line {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E

Purvis stays on his feet and overpowers Wren, pulling the scientist's head <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> The Alien erupts through Purvis' rib cage and Wren's head, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 22 Floréal coup in France {{undermined}} Delacroix, {{because it}} inspired more sympathy by French foreign minister Talleyrand for the Dutch opposition members who demanded the ambassador's recall. At the same time, Daendels became disaffected {{with the regime}} he had helped put into power because of the depredations of the purging commissions. His French colleague General Joubert was displeased with the radicals because of conflicts about the co-dominion of Flushing. Finally, the newly appointed Agenten were disturbed about the inefficiency of the Uitvoerend Bewind. All these disaffections came together with the putsch on June 12, 1798, of that recidivist, general Daendels, in which he disturbed a dinner party of Delacroix and {{three members of the}} Uitvoerend Bewind, violating the diplomatic immunity of the ambassador by putting pistols <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> The members of the Representative Assembly were arrested in session.|$|E
5|$|The {{long march}} from Seminary Ridge had left {{some of the}} Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused {{momentarily}} at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1915 and 1916, Kropotkin, {{who lived}} in Brighton, England, was often in poor health. He was unable to travel during the winter, having been ordered {{not to do so}} by doctors in January 1915, and {{underwent}} two operations <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> in March. As a result, he was confined to a bed for the majority of 1915 and to a wheeled bath-chair in 1916. During this time, Kropotkin kept a steady correspondence with other anarchists, including fellow Russian anarchist Marie Goldsmith. Goldsmith and Kropotkin clashed often on their opinions about the World War, the role of internationalism during the conflict, and whether it was possible to advocate antimilitarism during that period (early 1916). As explained above, Kropotkin took firmly pro-war positions during these communiques, as he was predisposed to frequently criticize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
50|$|Jerry notices <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> hair is uneven {{and tries}} to {{straighten}} it out, but ends up shaving it all off. He worries what his girlfriend Alex (Melinda Clarke) will think, until he discovers she's fond of hairless dogs. He continues <b>to</b> shave <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Kramer warns Jerry that shaving will only accelerate the hair's growth. After Jerry was invited on the Peterman Reality Tour, Alex notices that Jerry's beard has grown. While Kramer is at the garbage dump as the full moon comes out, Jerry's chest begins itching from hair growth as Kramer searches for a dump that'll take the muffin stumps. Jerry's itching makes him run off the bus, past Kramer, and into the forest <b>to</b> scratch <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> When the moon comes out, he howls like a werewolf while sighing at the relief that he can scratch <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> out in the woods.|$|R

5|$|Australia {{had added}} only nine {{runs on the}} third morning when Miller fell for 31. Four runs later, Morris fell for 51, leaving Australia 139/5. Barnes came in, despite having {{collapsed}} in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital. Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell. Lindwall came into bat at 172/6 with Australia facing {{the prospect of the}} follow on. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled, leaving Australia 208/7, five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. During his innings, Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich. One of the short-pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand, evoking cheers from the crowd. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Two {{bishops and}} a hermit came to Vladimir, {{gave him a}} wooden cross, and {{confirmed}} that the tsar had made a pledge of faith on it. Vladimir kissed the cross and clutched it <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> collected a few followers, and set off for Prespa. As he arrived, on 22May 1016, he went into a church to pray. When he exited the church, he was struck down by Vladislav's soldiers and beheaded. According to Skylitzes, Vladimir believed Vladislav's pledge, told {{to him by the}} Bulgarian archbishop David. He then allowed himself to fall into Vladislav's hands, and was executed. The motivation behind the murder is unclear. Since Samuel's defeat in 1014, the Bulgarians had been losing battle after battle, and Vladislav probably suspected or was informed that Vladimir planned to restore Duklja's alliance with Byzantium. This alliance would be particularly disturbing for Tsar Vladislav because of the proximity of Duklja to Dyrrhachium, which was a target of the tsar's war efforts.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{had added}} only nine {{runs on the}} third morning when Pollard trapped Miller for 31 with the new ball. Four runs later, Morris had reached 51 when Bedser removed him, leaving Australia 139/5.

Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon was caught behind from Edrich. Lindwall came into bat at 172/6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on. He then received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled by Pollard, leaving Australia 208/7, five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs.

5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's baby, {{who has been}} identified as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E
