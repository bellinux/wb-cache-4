5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed <b>the</b> <b>lush,</b> intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E

5|$|While his {{selections}} {{provided the}} album's {{country and western}} foundation, the musical arrangements represented its contemporary influence. Eager to display his big band ensemble in studio, Charles enlisted premier jazz arrangers Gerald Wilson and Gil Fuller, while Marty Paich, who {{was active in the}} West Coast jazz scene, was hired to arrange <b>the</b> <b>lush</b> strings and chorus numbers. Despite enlisting a roster of professional arrangers and musicians, Charles intended to control the artistic direction of the recordings. To indicate specific licks he wanted emphasized for certain songs, Charles would put together voice-and-piano demos and pass them along to the arrangers, informing them of {{what he wanted to do}} with specific sounds. According to Feller, at one point during recording, Charles rewrote an entire botched arrangement and dictated the parts to each of the 18 backing musicians.|$|E
