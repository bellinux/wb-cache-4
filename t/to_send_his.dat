5|$|Harper married Laureen Teskey on December 11, 1993. Laureen was {{formerly}} married to New Zealander Neil Fenton from 1985 to 1988. The Harpers have two children: Benjamin and Rachel. Harper {{is the third}} prime minister, after Pierre Trudeau and John Turner, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> children to Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. He {{is a member of}} the evangelical Christian and Missionary Alliance and attends church at the East Gate Alliance Church in Ottawa. According to party literature, he is learning Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In the fall, Hazen leveled {{charges of}} {{corruption}} and mismanagement against Isaac Tichenor, the deputy commissioner of purchases at Coös, General Bayley, the deputy quartermaster-general, and Matthew Lyons, the deputy commissioner of issues. His regiment were poorly supplied the whole summer at Coös, supplies of beef arrived spoiled, and Hazen had <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> men into the fields {{to help with the}} harvest so they could eat. Courts-martial were later held.|$|E
5|$|Stephen IV {{attempted}} {{to regain his}} throne with Emperor Manuel I's support, but the latter made peace with Stephen III. He agreed <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> younger brother, Béla, to Constantinople and to allow the Byzantines to seize Béla's duchy, which included Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. In an attempt to recapture these territories, Stephen III waged wars against the Byzantine Empire between 1164 and 1167, but could not defeat the Byzantines.|$|E

50|$|The letters Gayarre used <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{family when}} he was abroad are {{considered}} by linguists a treasure, as they represent {{some of the best}} samples from the Basque dialect of Roncal, now extinct.|$|R
5|$|The 2nd Army's command {{structure}} fell apart as Bagration was evacuated {{from the battlefield}} and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E
5|$|When the {{interior}} wall fell, the men, true to their promise, {{sprang from the}} ruins and fought with great courage, forcing Philip <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> troops forward in relays to the front line. By nightfall the Macedonians retreated to camp. That night the Abydenians resolved to save {{the women and children}} and at daybreak they sent some priests and priestess with a garland across to the Macedonians, surrendering the city to Philip.|$|E
5|$|After being educated by a governess, Allen joined Summer Fields School in Oxford in 1912. He {{began to}} play cricket seriously at school; by his second year, he reached the school second team, from where he progressed to the first team then the captaincy. His ability {{attracted}} the attention of Eton College, where a friend of Allen's father, C. M. Wells, was a housemaster. The family had planned to send Allen to Haileybury, but Wells persuaded Allen senior <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> son to Eton instead, although it was a considerable financial burden on the family. Allen, although not initially keen on the prospect, started there in the winter of 1915–16.|$|E

5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{completed}} his first {{studies at the}} San Carlos school, where he learned Latin, philosophy, logic, physics, metaphysics, and literature; he graduated in 1786. Domingo had sufficient success as merchant <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> two sons Francisco and Manuel to study in Europe. He expected them to study commerce, but Manuel decided to study law. Belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that Pope Pius VI allowed him to study forbidden literature, even books deemed as heretical, excepting only the astrological and obscene books. In this way he {{came into contact with}} authors like Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Filangieri, who were forbidden in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of the task of educating his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph decided <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abbé Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion would stay until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It was while a student here that he took up interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.|$|E

60|$|It was Stephen's {{intention}} {{to return to}} Portsmouth on the following morning, and the friends sat around the camp-fire until a late hour that evening. Walter had many messages <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother and Master McCleary, and if the messenger remembered them all his memory must have been prodigious.|$|R
5|$|Instead of annexing Shishman's lands, Milutin reinstalled Shishman as the despot of Vidin and {{concluded}} {{an alliance with}} him. To confirm the alliance, Shishman married the daughter of Serbian Grand Prince Dragoš. The future marriage of Shishman's son and future Bulgarian emperor Michael Shishman (r. 1323–1330) to Milutin's daughter Anna Neda was also arranged at the time {{with the intention of}} further sealing the union. It is quite apparent that Shishman's unlikely reinstallment in Vidin and alliance with Serbia were dictated by Nogai, as at the same time Serbia also came under Tatar dependence. Milutin was even forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> son Stephen Dečanski into captivity in order to prevent a Tatar attack.|$|E
5|$|Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking {{re-election}} did not campaign, Taft spoke publicly only once, {{making his}} nomination acceptance speech on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded {{he could not}} win, and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had no illusions he would win his race. He had hoped <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> cabinet officers {{out on the campaign}} trail, but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him.|$|E
5|$|The {{first year}} of his reign was {{peaceful}} because the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed I, was still occupied with the internal consolidation of the Ottoman Empire. Michael supported Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire {{in the autumn of}} 1419. They captured the city of Turnu Severin that Michael's father had lost to the Ottomans, but it was put under Sigismund's control. In retaliation, the sultan broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael to cede Giurgiu and other fortresses on the Danube to the Ottomans and to pay the tribute he had failed to send during the previous three years. Michael was also forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> two sons, Michael and Radu, as hostages to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Marshall's {{paternal}} grandfather, Riley Marshall, {{immigrated to}} Indiana in 1817 and {{settled on a}} farm in present-day Whitley County. He became wealthy when a moderate deposit of oil and natural gas was discovered on his farm; when he sold the property in 1827 it earned $25,000, $ in 2015 chained dollars. The money allowed him to purchase a modest estate and {{spend the rest of his}} life as an active member of the Indiana Democratic Party, serving as an Indiana State Senator, party chairman, and financial contributor. He was also able <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> only child, Daniel, to medical school.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{powerful}} lords—including the Šubići, Kőszegis and Csáks—urged CharlesII of Naples <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary {{in order to}} become king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák, however, were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew's envoy to the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either. Andrew, who had been in poor health for a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved.|$|E
5|$|After the Federal army {{rebuilt the}} City Point Railroad, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's {{overstretched}} forces. In August, Union forces captured Mobile Bay and on September 2, Sherman captured Atlanta while Confederate forces retreated. Both victories, combined with Sheridan's triumph in the Shenandoah Valley, ensured Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> army to march on Savannah and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville. It {{was the beginning}} of the end for the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being the only significant obstacle remaining.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, Watkins {{opened his}} first public gallery, in {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>his</b> photographs <b>to</b> the Universal Exposition in Paris, where he won a medal. This became his lavish Yosemite Art Gallery. He displayed over a hundred large Pacific Coast views in addition over a thousand images available through stereoscopes. Despite his success as an artist, he was not successful as a businessman and ended up losing his gallery to his creditor J.J. Cook.|$|R

5|$|Andrew III of Hungary {{made his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Alberto Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> grandson to Hungary {{to claim the}} throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, AndrewIII of Hungary, died on 14January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required {{that it should have}} been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.|$|E
5|$|In 1457, Skanderbeg had {{achieved}} {{his most famous}} victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena (Ujëbardha), which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy. In order to repay Alfonso for the financial and military assistance given to him years before, Skanderbeg took up the pope's pleas to help out Alfonso's son by sending a military expedition to Italy. Before leaving, Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, to ensure his domain's safety. Mehmed had not declared a truce {{and he was still}} sending his armies against Bosnia and the Morea. It was not until 1459, after Mehmed's conquest of Serbia, that Mehmed not only declared a truce, but also a three-year ceasefire with Skanderbeg. This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> men to Italy.|$|E
5|$|It {{was very}} soon after their arrival that they {{learned of the}} death of Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would {{repudiate}} his father's banishment of the Bourbons (which he later did). Louis XVIII then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>his</b> son, Louis Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but they did not at this time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and sent some money to Louis. Louis XVIII's court in exile was being spied on by French police. The court-in-exile was being financed mainly by interest owed from Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France and had to cut its expenses significantly.|$|E
