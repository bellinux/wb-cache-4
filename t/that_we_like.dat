[...] He said, [...] "Okay, we'll call the thing Jaws.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, stating {{that it is}} [...] "neither a good movie nor a bad one. It {{features}} actors <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> doing things we wish were more interesting." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "It is {{possible to have a}} good time at RED, but it is not a very good movie. It doesn't really try to be, and given the present state of the Hollywood economy, this may be a wise choice". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is {{we are going to}} bring in a large group of people <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>like,</b> and we try to empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching me in the face, I can’t cut them." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{always used}} to say in {{interviews}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> Joel because he couldn't play the drums. Of course he can, but he didn't play drums like a drummer. He wasn't piss-farting around on a high-hat. Stuart MacLeod ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Bands <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> {{were using}} {{samplers}} and {{there seemed to}} be no reason apart from the financial <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't look to use them.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with BeatRoute Magazine, Ian Graham described the recording process different from previous albums in that the band [...] "learned that it’s good to record an idea <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked,</b> even if <b>we</b> didn’t use it. We were more ambitious this time.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} began recording with producer Brendan O'Brien, who {{had previously}} worked with the band on Light Grenades (2006) and A Crow Left of the Murder... (2004). Recording took place at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Henson Studios in Los Angeles and Casa Chica in Malibu. Vocalist Brandon Boyd discussed the decision to work with O'Brien once again, stating, [...] "We {{grew up listening to}} his records. We quickly became friends and that's been a catalyst for our success with him. He understands <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> to work quickly." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "I love Brendan and I consider him like a family member. Over the years he’s been like a musical confidante and he’s been very loyal and very helpful. He’s gotten involved in other stuff that he didn’t have to get involved with outside of the band." [...] Pasillas noted, [...] "He’s kind of like a sixth member." [...] Einziger recorded the majority of his guitar parts in his house.|$|E
2500|$|Boyd {{described}} the album as having [...] "a very a particularly warm musical tone to it. It steps further out from anything we've ever done." [...] Boyd {{also noted that}} the sound on the new record is the culmination of a long search for a new sound and direction for the band; [...] "I do believe that for many years now we have been searching for something different. Something unique, both to the world and to us as a band. We decided that If Not Now, When?, our seventh full length studio album, would be just that." [...] Prior to the album's release, bassist Ben Kenney discussed the writing process in relation to fan expectations, stating [...] "from my perspective, we only write music to satisfy ourselves. We love to play and we’ve been fortunate to have people follow us and have really great and successful records. But, for the most part it’s to entertain each other and write music <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> to play." [...] Discussing the band's stylistic change, Kenney noted, [...] "There’s no way we could have written this record a few years ago." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{rose from}} another early R.E.M. song, [...] "Burning Down." [...] According to guitarist Peter Buck, as recounted on the Dead Letter Office liner notes, [...] "When we {{got tired of}} Down', we kept the two pieces <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> and rewrote the rest {{to come up with}} 'Ages of You'. We got tired of that one, also." ...|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the similar}} timing of Still Missing and Without A Trace, some {{suggested}} a strained relationship between Gutcheon {{and the parents}} of famously missing child Etan Patz. The controversy was corrected in a 1982 letter to the Editor at the New York Times where Stanley K. Patz, Etan's father, said [...] "We repeatedly stated <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had no quarrel with Beth Gutcheon and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> her." ...|$|R

6000|$|That is {{not great}} poetry, {{and may not}} be {{compared}} with a sonnet of Wordsworth; but it is good, honest sentiment expressed in such a melodious way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> to read it, and feel better after the reading.

60|$|It is an {{important}} question. For, throughout our past reasonings about art, we have always found that nothing could be good or useful, or ultimately pleasurable, which was untrue.

6000|$|I think, perhaps, we talk {{of kings}} and queens more at our table than people do at other tables in England; not, of course, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> them better, or admire them more, but that they are curiosities.

We wanted to go heavy, we wanted {{to do a lot of}} double-bass drum, kind of syncopated rhythms, and we wanted to basically write songs <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could bob our heads to.
