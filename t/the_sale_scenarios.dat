40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} designed to develop a segmented <b>sales</b> approach using <b>the</b> target costing method. Herby {{it is important to}} note that this thesis is a practical one, on behalf of a German high-tech company. The assignment was to create feasible action points, which will later assist during <b>the</b> company's <b>sales</b> approach improvements. <b>The</b> theoretical part of this thesis deals with the basics of product segmentation, process analysis and sales channel analysis. Afterwards, the theoretical background for <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> cost analysis, target costing method and <b>sales</b> <b>scenarios</b> is elaborated. <b>The</b> aim was to define major elements later applied in this thesis. The second part of this thesis applies the theoretical knowledge established in the first chapter to the situation at the company. The results of the project show an importance to focus on one specific product, due to a high level of competition. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>scenario</b> consists of <b>the</b> direct and <b>the</b> indirect <b>sales</b> channel. As a consequence, sales costs are very high. The third chapter gives recommendations for each chapter. Results show the need for simplicity and less reporting as well as one maintained document archive system. The third part shows the importance of establishing an online channel. Furthermore, it is advised to establish one strategy for <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> channels and to communicate this to coordinate different <b>sales</b> channels effectively. <b>The</b> fourth and fifth parts deal with <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> cost and target costing recommendations, highlighting marketing and HR costs as the main cost driver. One solution to reduce <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> cost is to establish the online channel, saving travel costs and to reevaluate marketing activities. That way, the target of limiting <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> cost to 15...|$|R

40|$|The {{received}} {{wisdom in}} industrial selling emphasizes systematic approaches where <b>the</b> typical <b>sales</b> <b>scenario</b> comprises prospecting, pre-approach, approach, presentation, handling objections, closing and follow-up. However, times are changing, {{making such a}} systematic approach to selling not always optimal. As markets become more unpredictable, salespersons must frequently employ unplanned, spur-of-the-moment responses to be responsive in unexpected and urgent situations. In spite of the pervasiveness of such improvised responses, the literature has yet to account for them. Accordingly, {{the objective of this}} study is to investigate the consequences, antecedents and boundaries of salesperson improvisation. From a descriptive decision-making perspective, the study proposes a conceptual model of salesperson improvisation and tests it on a sample of industrial salespersons in Ghana. Findings support a two-dimensional structure of salesperson improvisation comprising salesperson creativity and spontaneity. Findings also show that the dimensions may have differential implications for sales performance. Salesperson creativity during improvisation may engender sales losses while spontaneity may be related to sales success. However, neither dimension has a significant direct relationship with <b>sales</b> performance. Rather, <b>the</b> paths from creativity and spontaneity to sales performance become activated by resource availability, pressure to perform and individual agency. Resource availability renders the creativityâ€“performance link positive while individual agency makes it negative. On the other hand, given high performance pressures, the positive non-significant path from spontaneity to sales performance assumes a significant negative tone. The study also finds that the two dimensions differ, to some extent, in the factors that drive them. Self-efficacy drives creativity but reduces spontaneity during improvisation. Experience also reduces spontaneity but has no direct effect on creativity. Salesperson autonomy, however, is a universal driver of both creativity and spontaneity. Implications of these findings for <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> management and improvisation literatures, and for practice are discussed. The researcher also outlines opportunities for future research. ...|$|R

While the pre-launching activities have {{the purpose of}} accurately defining the objectives, assumptions and estimations, {{the purpose of the}} post-launching plan is to identify: if the final objectives of a product launching have been met, on one hand, to analyze results in the sense of identifying an efficient action plan in order to overcome the lack of results (if case), but most important, to identify opportunities for optimizing the products and for communicating properly the value proposition. This paper also presents schemes for monitoring the results from a business case and for motivating <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> force, as an essential step in increasing <b>the</b> <b>sales.</b> Therefore, alternatives of incentive campaigns are presented, as sustainable campaigns with to purpose to achieve an expected success rate. As an additional support guideline for <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> force, some <b>scenarios</b> and post-sales actions are presented, together with an example of portfolio analysis considering potential per client. Considering the methods and details presented in the current paper, one can identify the importance and find out how to monitor the results after launching a new transactional product addressed to SMEs, can understand and design an incentive scheme and also define actions to be taken in order to increase revenues from a newly launched transactional product...|$|R
40|$|Micro-sized {{commercial}} agencies face a poor {{electronic and}} mobile sales support. Most of <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> information systems are {{built for the}} usage within larger-sized companies. Problems particularly appear when processes of multiple suppliers have to be integrated into <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> processes of <b>the</b> commercial agencies. The paper addresses the issue of process optimization in form of a mobile multi-supplier sales information system for micro-sized commercial agencies. Two major areas of improvements can be realized: Firstly, by an optimized business process integration of multiple SME suppliers and their sales representatives in micro-sized commercial agencies (internal supplier oriented sales processes), and secondly, by an increased mobility in connection with an optimization of sales processes outside of the office infrastructure (external customer <b>sales</b> processes). <b>The</b> paper examines the common processes in commercial agencies and derives relevant processes {{as well as the}} appropriate IT-support in form of use cases. The relevant processes and the use cases depend strongly on certain key parameters of a commercial agency's business relationships with its suppliers. Therefore, the paper introduces a branch independent concept for <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> cockpit with <b>the</b> focus on selected <b>sales</b> <b>scenarios,</b> relevant business processes, and derived use cases depending on selected key parameters. By funding the research project M 3 V, the German Ministry of Economies and Technology aims to create a secure, mobile, multi-supplier sales information system as a service for micro-sized commercial agencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the intercultural and gender differences between American and Czech customers in relation to their perceptions of the verbal and nonverbal personality characteristics of a salesperson during <b>the</b> personal <b>sales</b> process. This research provides scholars and practitioners with an understanding of the cultural and gender-specific personal interaction factors that should be addressed when designing effective interpersonal <b>sales</b> approaches. <b>The</b> study utilized an experimental design approach. Personal selling scenarios were filmed and shown to respondents (university students acting as potential customers) who completed a survey regarding <b>sales</b> effectiveness. <b>The</b> resulting data was factor analyzed and a conceptual personal sales model was developed. The model suggests that salesperson authenticity and personal interaction factors impact sales success in both the U. S. and the Czech Republic. However, there are variations in the receptivity of potential U. S. and Czech customers to specific interpersonal communication factors. Gender-based variations were also identified. The study focused on automotive retail <b>sales</b> <b>scenarios</b> in <b>the</b> United States; however, the results can be generalized to similar markets...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} means of deferring the {{breakthrough}} of injected N 2 and alleviating the impact of such on production ratesÂ and specifications as well as minimizing the required changes to the gas processing facilities. This aimed at assisting the ongoingÂ efforts to transfer the Cantarell experience to Abu Dhabi, where large amounts of N 2 gas will be generated and injected into a largeÂ gas condensate reservoir to partially substitute the recycling of lean gas. This will bring forward the opportunity to exploit lean gasÂ by securing base load supplies {{before the start of}} reservoir blowdown, compared to the peak shaving approach currently practiced. Â Managing N 2 breakthrough starts by better understanding the pattern at which N 2 injection spreads into the gas accumulation. BasedÂ on the findings of initial subsurface and plant simulations carried out in 2008, N 2 breakthrough in Abu Dhabi might be possiblyÂ deferred by segmenting the reservoir into a rich N 2 region and lean N 2 region. The approach assumes no thief zones will be facedÂ and no channeling of N 2 injected between the two regions is taking place. N 2 is injected in the north region of the reservoir. TheÂ production of that region will be segregated and fed to a gas processing plant of lower NGL (natural gas liquid) recovery, whichÂ essentially takes longer time to start suffering the deterioration of residue gas (gas mixture resulted after separating NGL) quality. Â The residue gas use can be limited to re-injection where the effect of below specification LHV (Low Heat Value) would not be anÂ issue. The rest of the reservoir feeds another gas processing plant of higher NGL recovery level from which an amount of residue gasÂ equivalent to that of the injected N 2 will be rerouted to <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> network. This <b>scenario</b> will significantly delay as well as downsizeÂ the requirement of a N 2 rejection plant. There is technical and certainly economical advantage of deferring the installation of costlyÂ N 2 rejection units. Such a requirement can be entirely eliminated if <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> gas specification can be relaxed considering blendingÂ with other gas streams of higher LHV, and in collaboration with gas customers, i. e. assessing their capability to tolerate feedstock ofÂ lower specifications. It must be noted that such school of thinking may not necessarily be eventually embraced. The chosen scenarioÂ will also depend on the final configuration, i. e., wells grouping and gas gathering, of the ongoing project...|$|R
