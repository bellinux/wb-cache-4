5|$|In the 17th century, at {{the church}} of St Vigeans, near Arbroath, communion was not held for several years because the villagers {{believed}} there was a curse on the church.

5|$|Another officially {{published}} doctrinal {{change was}} {{that women in}} <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to wear makeup. In the earliest years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women. In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Senior Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a Yeltsin appointee, {{signed a}} {{decision}} {{for the removal of}} the institute. The decision, dated 7March 1995, ordered the institute's departure by 1996. Simultaneously, the institute wrote to Luzhkov describing the earlier events from their perspective, and requested compensation for loss of the building. In a meeting with the Polish Ambassador, Stanisław Ciosek, on 15March 1995, the acting mayor of Moscow, Alexander Musykantski, assured him that the return of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>would</b> be complete {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>would</b> be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|Tradition {{has it that}} {{a church}} {{dedicated}} to the Holy Trinity stood at the summit until it was razed by the Ottomans; in another version, the church crumbled after {{a boy and a}} girl sinned within. Before 2005, there was a custom to pick up a stone at a certain distance from the peak and carry it to the supposed site of the church in the belief that when a sufficient quantity of stones were collected, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>would</b> rebuild itself. A new church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was consecrated on the site by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 31 July 2005.|$|E

50|$|On 11 September 2014 the Deputy Prime Minister Etienne Schneider {{announced}} plans to introduce a church tax, payable only by members of religious congregations; <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>would</b> then have to pay their clergy's salaries themselves.

25|$|Worship of the Holy Spirit was {{promoted}} by Joachim of Fiore, a millenarian prophet who, {{on the basis}} on his interpretation of the Book of Revelation, postulated that 1260 would see {{the beginning of a}} third age. (He himself died in 1202.) The third age would be governed by the Holy Spirit and would represent a monastic governance, in which the hierarchy of <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> be unnecessary and infidels would unite with Christians. These theories became associated with the Fraticelli strand of the Franciscan Order and were condemned by Pope Alexander IV in 1256.|$|E
25|$|By the Middle Ages, the Benedictines and Cistercians {{would come}} to be the {{dominating}} force. The Dukes of Burgundy and Valois, through their political influence and patronage of <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>would</b> do much to spread the renown of the area for its unique and distinctive wines.

50|$|In this post-Reformation {{period of}} {{political}} change, canonical jurists sought to defend within {{the categories of}} the public law the right of <b>the</b> Catholic <b>Church</b> to make and enforce law. Hence the name, jus publicum ecclesiasticum—"public ecclesiastical law". The justification of the legal powers of <b>the</b> Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> now be defended {{along the lines of}} the sovereign state's justification for its own legal powers, and <b>the</b> Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>would</b> be considered a concurrent and complementary Communitas Perfecta in the realm of the supernatural end of man to that of the civil sovereign state in the realm of the natural end of man.|$|R

25|$|The racial {{nature of}} the parish did not change much for half a century, but {{beginning}} in the mid-1970s, the composition of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>would</b> be transformed.

25|$|Following the Reformation, {{the name}} of the church was {{shortened}} to Vrouwekerk because the original name, Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk, was considered too Catholic-sounding. The building was donated to the Huguenots (Calvinist refugees from the Southern Netherlands and France), coming into use as a Walloon church in 1584. As greater and greater numbers of religious refugees came to Leiden in the 17th Century, the parish grew to some 6,000 members.
