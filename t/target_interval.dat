The proposed method identifies key parameters in high-dimensional nonlinear systems that are subject to uncertainty. A numerical optimization algorithm seeks a solution space on which all designs are good, that is, they satisfy a specified design criterion. The solution space is box-shaped and provides <b>target</b> <b>intervals</b> for each parameter. A bad design may be turned into a good design by moving its key parameters into their <b>target</b> <b>intervals.</b> The solution space is computed so as to minimize the effort for design work: its shape is controlled by particular constraints such that it can be reached by changing {{only a small number of}} key parameters. Wide <b>target</b> <b>intervals</b> provide tolerance against uncertainty, which is naturally present in a design process, when design parameters are unknown or cannot be controlled exactly.

40|$|Many {{activities}} {{require the}} ability to estimate intervals of time in an accurate and flexible manner. A traditional and popular account suggests that humans possess a kind of internal stopwatch that can be started, paused and stopped at will. Here we test this idea by measuring variable performance errors in three experiments. Participants had to compare the total time accumulated during one to three short <b>target</b> <b>intervals</b> with a single standard interval. With two or more <b>target</b> <b>intervals,</b> participants had to pause, but not reset, their putative internal stopwatches. By establishing baseline performance at two different standard durations and extrapolating based on Weber’s law, {{we were able to}} estimate how much performance should have deteriorated when target segments contained breaks. The decrement in performance we observed far exceeded the stopwatch prediction, and also exceeded the simulated predictions of a modified stopwatch with a slowing pacemaker. The data thus favour either a counter that cannot be paused during sub-second durations or alternative models of sub-second interval duration discrimination which do not posit a count-based metric for time. We discuss several possible strategies which participants might have implemented in order to apply such clocks in the split-interval task...|$|R

The experiment was conducted double-blind, and with random assignment of 32 healthy aged and 32 healthy young participants to either inert placebo or levodopa (200 mg) groups. The procedure included training participants to produce two <b>target</b> time <b>intervals</b> (6 and 17 sec) in separate blocks, drug/placebo administration, a 1 -hr delay, and then delayed free-recall time production retesting without feedback. Participants also performed a speeded choice reaction time (RT) task, as a control for potential dopaminergic and aging effects on attention and psychomotor speed. Results indicate that during retesting, aged participants show duration-dependent timing errors that are larger than those shown by the young participants. Levodopa administration yielded lengthened time production of both <b>target</b> <b>intervals.</b> The aging and levodopa effects did not interact. Also, aging slowed RT and increased RT variability, but levodopa {{had no effect on}} the RT. These results suggest that at this dosage and under these specific conditions, timing is dopamine-mediated but the effect of aging on time production is not.

The present study is an open-ended investigation that further explores this area. It particularly addresses {{the question of whether}} or not the ratio of the lengths of successive intervals in a series, affects the accuracy of reproduction of that series. 48 normal human subject volunteers from the first year psychology population of the University of Cape Town each reproduced 16 four-interval series in two experiments with target intervals of either 1 000 milliseconds or 3 000 milliseconds. The "empty" intervals were delimited by 50 millisecond sound pulses. Each series consisted of a <b>target</b> <b>interval</b> and three "other" intervals. In any given series, the three "other" intervals were equal, and their durations relative to the standard were in one of the following ratios: 1 : 3, 3 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 1, 2 : 3, 3 : 2. Six groups of 8 subjects each were used. In the two experiments each group was assigned to one temporal ratio. Each group reproduced 8 series. In 4 of these series the subjects were required to reproduce the entire series as heard. In the other 4, the subject heard the entire series but reproduced the <b>target</b> <b>interval</b> only. Each series was heard and reproduced three times before moving on to the next series.

When the interference within a range gate is coherent, the cross correlation between the desired signal and the coherent interference signal is nonzero.

Therefore, we utilize frequency averaging to suppress the correlation of the coherent interference. The results of computational simulations using a pseudoecho signal show that the Capon method with adaptive frequency averaging (AFA) provides a higher range resolution than a conventional method.
