40|$|When {{elephants}} leave primary {{protected areas}} (PPAs), such as {{national parks and}} game reserves, they may come into conflict with people residing on the adjoining land. In this study, I attempted to determine why African savannah elephants leave <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> {{in which they were}} collared. To accomplish this, I used telemetry locations of collared elephants in PPAs throughout southern Africa and investigated whether a range of intrinsic and extrinsic variables could explain why elephants crossed the boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>PPAs.</b> Adjoining many of <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> were secondary protected areas (SPAs), which consisted of community conservancies, and collectively with <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> formed clusters of protected areas. Most (45 of 49) elephants roamed beyond <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> but they remained within the clusters of protected areas. The elephants utilised both <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> and the SPAs and appeared to not feel threatened when using the SPAs. The reasons for elephants leaving PPAs varied both seasonally and between the sexes. The females roamed beyond <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> more during the wet season than the dry season, whereas, for males there was no seasonal difference. During the wet season, female and male habitat selection was similar within and beyond <b>the</b> <b>PPAs.</b> During the dry season, more females and males beyond <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> selected for areas close to people, which could be indicative of water. The proportion of male and female home ranges beyond PPAs did not increase with increasing density of elephant populations within <b>the</b> <b>PPAs,</b> nor did the proportion of female home ranges beyond PPAs increase with increasing population growth rate of elephant populations within <b>the</b> <b>PPAs.</b> Therefore, high numbers of elephants within <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> did not drive elephants beyond the boundaries. Contrastingly, the proportion of male home ranges beyond <b>the</b> <b>PPAs</b> did increase with increasing population growth rate. However, the results were inconclusive due to small sample size. This study confirms that elephants are utilising the SPAs as well as <b>the</b> <b>PPAs.</b> Therefore, the importance of including the SPAs in conservation actions for elephants cannot be over-emphasized.

40|$|The parahippocampal place area (PPA) is one {{of several}} brain regions that respond more {{strongly}} to scenes than to non-scene items such as objects and faces. The mechanism underlying this scene-preferential response remains unclear. One possibility is that <b>the</b> <b>PPA</b> is tuned to low-level stimulus features that are found more often in scenes than in less preferred stimuli. Supporting this view, Nasr and colleagues (2014) recently observed that some of the stimuli that are known to strongly activate <b>the</b> <b>PPA</b> contain a large number of rectilinear edges. They further demonstrated that PPA response is modulated by rectilinearity for a range of non-scene images.

In the first experiment, we replicated the previous finding of modulation by rectilinearity in <b>the</b> <b>PPA</b> for arrays of 2 -d shapes. However, two further experiments failed to find a rectilinearity effect for faces or scenes: high-rectilinearity faces and scenes did not activate <b>the</b> <b>PPA</b> any more strongly than low-rectilinearity faces and scenes. Moreover, the categorical advantage for scenes vs. faces was maintained in <b>the</b> <b>PPA</b> and two other scene-selective regions—the retrosplenial complex (RSC) and occipital place area (OPA) –when rectilinearity was matched between stimulus sets.
