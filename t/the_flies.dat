5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> evil is within them.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} indoor <b>flies</b> include housefly, <b>the</b> lesser housefly, <b>the</b> stable <b>fly,</b> <b>the</b> blue bottle <b>fly,</b> <b>the</b> green bottles and <b>the</b> flesh <b>flies.</b> <b>The</b> common outdoor <b>flies</b> include <b>the</b> black <b>flies,</b> <b>the</b> deer <b>flies,</b> <b>the</b> horse <b>flies,</b> <b>the</b> hover <b>flies,</b> <b>the</b> crane <b>flies</b> and some muscoids. There {{are also some}} 113 species of mosquitos {{discovered}} in Bangladesh, the most common genera are Anopheles, Culex, Aedes, Mansonia, Psorophora and Haemagogus.|$|R
50|$|While the Sakasa Kebari {{tends to}} be fished dead drifted (allowing <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> to simply drift with the current) like its western {{counterparts}} many people fish <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> {{with a variety of}} movements, such as pulsating <b>the</b> <b>fly,</b> pausing <b>the</b> <b>fly,</b> and allowing <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> to drift downstream and across the current (much like fishing western style wet flies).|$|R
5|$|Four super {{radiations}} {{of insects}} have occurred: beetles (evolved about 300 million years ago), flies (evolved about 250 million years ago), and moths and wasps (evolved about 150 million years ago). These four groups {{account for the}} majority of described species. <b>The</b> <b>flies</b> and moths along with the fleas evolved from the Mecoptera.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be {{inhabited}} by species of limoniid flies, such as Discobola marginata or Limonia yakushimensis, {{as well as}} several species of fungi-dwelling mites. <b>The</b> <b>flies</b> are hosts for the mites in a symbiotic association known as phoresis, whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Lisa gives {{a bottle of}} whiskey to a man on horseback (payment for {{delivering}} a letter) is a reference to Meryl Streep's scene from the film The French Lieutenant's Woman. Some aspects of the episode are references to the novel Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> (a pig's head on a spear, kids using primitive weapons and wearing war paint, and a burning effigy).|$|E
5000|$|Flies {{are often}} casts as antagonists, {{because they are}} so {{associated}} with repulsiveness. Example: <b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> (adapted into film twice as <b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> (1958) and <b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> (1986)), <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> in Meet <b>the</b> Feebles is a tabloid journalist, Baxter Stockman ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{first appeared in}} the DC Comics' Impact Comics series, <b>The</b> <b>Fly.</b> <b>The</b> character is loosely based on Archie Comics' character, <b>The</b> <b>Fly.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Francis <b>the</b> <b>Fly</b> (voiced by Brian Herring) - Francis <b>the</b> <b>Fly</b> {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> episode <b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> where it used its buzzing {{to communicate with}} Mopatop and Puppyduck.|$|R
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. <b>The</b> <b>flies</b> lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna {{are still}} on the run, rescued by Martin who calls the AA. Whilst on their journey, they accidentally kill three more people, a mechanic, a shop {{assistant}} and a policeman. Soon, they decide that, with no transport, money or employment, the only option is suicide. They are last seen, naked, walking hand-in-hand towards the sea. Meanwhile, Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident and has developed better dress sense. Boyce ends up missing Alan, after his replacement turns out to be even more horrible. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot, as in The Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Flies.</b> They form their own tribe and become hostile to anyone who enters the department.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus fruit {{bodies are}} {{sometimes}} infested with larvae, though {{not nearly as}} often as S.granulatus or B.edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare {{late in the season}} with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.|$|E

5|$|That even a dead ala is bad {{is seen in}} {{the legend}} {{explaining}} the origin of the Golubatz fly (Simulium colombaschense), a species of bloodsucking black fly (of the genus Simulium) that can be lethal to livestock. The legend, recorded in the Požarevac District in the 19th century by Vuk Karadžić, tells how a Serbian man, after a chase, caught and wounded an ala, but she broke away and fled into a cave near Golubac (a town in the district), where she died of the wounds. Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, they fly out of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija. People walled up the cave’s opening once, but when the time came for <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> to swarm, the wall shattered.|$|E
5|$|The Act II {{illustration}} from Les Beautés shows a {{dark wood}} {{with a pool}} of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>flies,</b> the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company {{troubles}} did not {{end with}} its union problems. In September 1924, John Henry Ennis of Ellisville, Mississippi purchased a Grapico. On drinking it, Ennis discovered that the contents were filled with flies, some of which he swallowed and became sick. On filing a lawsuit against Grapico Bottling Company and its sole stockholder, Philip Carriere, Ennis learned that Grapico Bottling Company had filed for and successfully dissolved itself as a corporation between the time Ennis consumed <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> and filed suit against Grapico Bottling. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued an opinion that serve as precedent in Mississippi for the rule that a stockholder of a corporation is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and other acts of the corporation. After Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works became the sole supplier of Grapico to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. <b>The</b> <b>flies</b> that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap <b>the</b> <b>flies)</b> that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E
2500|$|Dry flies may be [...] "attractors", {{such as the}} Royal Wulff, or [...] "natural imitators", such as the elk hair caddis, a caddisfly {{imitation}} A beginner {{may wish}} {{to begin with a}} fly that is easy to see such as a Royal Wulff attractor or a mayfly imitation such as a parachute adams. The [...] "parachute" [...] on the parachute adams makes <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> land as softly as a natural on the water and has the added benefit of making <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> very visible from the surface. Being able to see <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> is especially helpful to <b>the</b> beginner. <b>The</b> <b>fly</b> should land softly, as if dropped onto the water, with the leader fully extended from <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> line. Due to rivers having faster and slower currents often running side by side, <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> can over take or be overtaken by the line, thus disturbing <b>the</b> <b>fly's</b> drift. Mending is a technique whereby one lifts and moves the part of the line that requires re-aligning with <b>the</b> <b>fly's</b> drift, thus extending the drag free drift. The mend can be upstream or down stream depending on the currents carrying <b>the</b> line or <b>fly.</b> To be effective, any mending of <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> line should not disturb the natural drift of <b>the</b> <b>fly.</b> Learning to mend is often much easier if the angler can see <b>the</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|R
25|$|Terminal tackle is used {{to connect}} <b>the</b> {{artificial}} <b>fly</b> to <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> line and allow the appropriate presentation of <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> to <b>the</b> fish.|$|R
50|$|Some time later, <b>the</b> <b>Fly</b> {{begins to}} display fly-like tendencies like eating garbage. He also {{develops}} physical mutations, including facet eyes. <b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> attacks Spider-Man after Spencer Smythe handcuffed him—along with Jameson—to a bomb. <b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> hurls <b>the</b> two from a rooftop and leaves them for dead. Once {{freed from the}} shackle, Spider-Man tries to stop <b>the</b> <b>Fly</b> from stealing an art exhibit, but the villain knocks him down and escapes. Soon afterwards, the police catch <b>the</b> <b>Fly</b> using S.H.I.E.L.D. equipment.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flies</b> {{also cause}} a huge {{economic}} problem in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas sun-drying {{is the major}} method of preserving fish, as ice is typically unaffordable. However, blowfly larvae tend to infect these sun-dried fish {{when the weather is}} warm and humid. In an experiment, 95% of the infecting flies were found to be C. megacephala. <b>The</b> <b>flies</b> can be controlled by using an odor that <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> are attracted to trap them. Insecticides are also used, although this results in the development of resistance.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse populations can be {{monitored}} and effectively controlled using simple, inexpensive traps. These often use electric blue cloth, since this color attracts <b>the</b> <b>flies.</b> Early traps mimicked {{the form of}} cattle but this seems unnecessary and recent traps are simple sheets or have a biconical form. The traps can kill by channeling <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> into a collection chamber or by exposing <b>the</b> <b>flies</b> to insecticide sprayed on the cloth. Tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes. Some scientists put forward the idea that zebra have stripes, not as a camouflage in long grass, but because {{the black and white}} bands tend to confuse tsetse and prevent attack.|$|E
25|$|In September 1965, Burns {{decided to}} leave <b>The</b> <b>Flies</b> to go solo – his place was taken by Peter Nicoll from The Wild Colonials. Promoter Jeff Joseph who ran Pinocchios Promotions – the booking agency for Spry's artists – left and took over as Burns' manager. An {{extended}} play was released by RCA consisting of four tracks from their singles, but was attributed to <b>The</b> <b>Flies,</b> vocal by Ronnie Burns.|$|E
5000|$|Curse of <b>the</b> <b>Fly</b> {{centers on}} Henri and Martin Delambre, {{identified}} as the son and grandson of the Andre Delambre character depicted in <b>The</b> <b>Fly.</b> Andre's invention of a teleportation device and subsequent accidental integration with a housefly remain within the backstory. However, his resultant assisted suicide is removed; instead, his son [...] - [...] apparently a different character from the boy Philippe Delambre depicted in <b>The</b> <b>Fly</b> [...] - [...] {{was able to put}} both the altered man and <b>the</b> altered <b>fly</b> back into <b>the</b> teleportation chamber and successfully reverse the integration, as was done with an adult Philippe in Return of <b>the</b> <b>Fly.</b> <b>The</b> dialogue within Curse of <b>the</b> <b>Fly</b> contains no mention of Philippe, although a photograph shown in the film, which is supposed to be of Andre in his altered form from <b>The</b> <b>Fly,</b> is actually a production still from Philippe's transformation in Return of <b>the</b> <b>Fly.</b>|$|R
