5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened {{to ruin the}} Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. <b>The</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. <b>The</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H.peckii. While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.|$|E

Section 64 of the LRA, however, {{requires}} that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> dispute first be referred to a bargaining council or the CCMA before a strike can be called. A certificate declaring that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> dispute was not resolved or 30 days or, alternatively, any extension must lapse and notice {{must be given to}} the employer before a strike can commence.

5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees {{had created a}} thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it {{made no mention of}} fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups. This proposed barrage would pass two miles (3km) west of Flat Holm. The study is expected to last {{at least two years}} and will be split into two stages with a decision point at the end of each. The first, which is likely to run until late 2008, will focus on high-level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary. Subject to the decision {{at the end of the}} first phase, the second phase will look at <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> more detail and culminate in a full public consultation in early 2010.|$|E

5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} the {{relatives}} {{did not have a}} right to occupational injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees did not have a right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of the relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E
5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E
