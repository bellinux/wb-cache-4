50|$|Most {{vibration}} analysis instruments today utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) {{which is}} a special case of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform and converts the vibration signal from its time domain representation to its equivalent frequency domain representation. However, frequency analysis (sometimes called Spectral Analysis or Vibration Signature Analysis) is {{only one aspect of}} interpreting the information contained in a vibration signal. Frequency analysis tends to be most useful on machines that employ rolling element bearings and whose main failure modes tend to be the degradation of those bearings, which typically exhibit an increase in characteristic frequencies associated with the bearing geometries and constructions. Depending on the type of machine, its typical malfunctions, the bearing types employed, rotational speeds, and other factors, the CM specialist may use additional diagnostic tools, such as examination of the time domain signal, the phase relationship between vibration components and a <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> on the machine shaft (often known as a keyphasor), historical trends of vibration levels, the shape of vibration, and numerous other aspects of the signal along with other information from the process such as load, bearing temperatures, flow rates, valve positions and pressures to provide an accurate diagnosis. This is particularly true of machines that use fluid bearings rather than rolling-element bearings. To enable them to look at this data in a more simplified form vibration analysts or machinery diagnostic engineers have adopted a number of mathematical plots to show machine problems and running characteristics, these plots include the bode plot, the waterfall plot, the polar plot and the orbit time base plot amongst others.|$|E
40|$|The {{ambulatory}} electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder {{has been}} in existence {{for more than two}} decades. It is used to document the transient electrocardiographic events in a patient over a protracted period. The conventional ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder, including the advanced ones, can only operate for 24 hours or so due to the memory storage constraints. In certain cases, a longer recording period is required in order to capture the symptoms that don't occur during the 24 -hour recording cycle. This thesis deals with the development of a prolonged ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder that is capable of operating for three days and recording two channels of electrocardiographic data in a continuous fashion. Practicability is given first priority in design. To minimize the cost of this instrument, a tape storage technique has been employed in this project. Generally, the operating time of an ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder is restricted by the length of tape. The technology developed in this project superimposes the <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> onto the electrocardiographic data and lets the tape move in two directions so that the track on the tape surface previously occupied by the <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> is utilized for storage of the electrocardiographic data. In this manner, the memory size is doubled and the desired operating time can be achieved. To ensure portability and adequate power life, a switchmode dc-dc voltage converter is employed. As a result, the number of batteries needed for operation is made desirably few. To implement the design, a portable auto-reverse music player (Sony ·Walkman) was purchased and modified into an ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder. The ambulatory ECG recorder developed in this project was tested on a subject as well as on two patients at the Royal University Hospital. The results show that it is capable of operating for as long as three days and the recorded data are very close to the original ECG signal in shape...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Compression {{pressure}} of individual cylinder and valve timing have big influence on combustion pressure, indicated {{mean effective pressure}} (IMEP), emission, vibration, combustion noise and many other combustion parameters. Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and valve timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost. To check valve timing, related FEAD parts should be disassembled and <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> should be checked manually. This study describes and suggests new methodology to measure compression pressure by analysis of start motor current and to check valve timing by cylinder pressure with high accuracy.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture and achievable {{performance of a}} time-to-digital converter by cascading a time stretcher and a gated ring oscillator based time-to-digital converter (GRO-TDC). The analogue time expansion, where the time interval to be measured is stretched by a factor k, is realized by charging a capacitor with a current I followed by discharging the capacitor by a current I/k. The currents are created by wide swing cascode current source/sinks with a current ratio of k. The time stretching method involves two conversions: time to charge and then charge to time. Whereas these are performed in each individualpixel, the final time to digital conversion is performed by the global GRO-TDC, where a multiphase gated ring oscillator is {{used to measure the}} stretched time interval by counting full clock cycles and storing the states of the ring oscillator within the clock period to obtain increased resolution. A block diagram of the proposed structure is shown paper. The nine phase single ended gated ring oscillator operates as an interpolator and as a clock during charge to time conversion. The layout of the gated inverters in the oscillator is designed by placing them in an order to compensate for the parasitic loading of capacitance for each stage and to minimize the effects of process variations. The clock of the 8 -bit ripple counter is enabled {{at the start of the}} charge to time conversion by the Start-Stretch signal. The result of the counter will be ready after the clock of the counter is disabled to the counter by the Stop-Stretch <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> from the comparator. Special attention is paid to the design of the hysteresis based comparator using positive feedback. The comparator is designed to achieve acceptable robustness against transistor mismatch, small power dissipation, offset voltage, linearity, speed, small area and good noise immunity. The digital flip-flops functioning as an interpolator will store the time interval measurement responses with in the clock cycle. By selecting an appropriate stretch factor and suitable clock frequency for the gated ring oscillator, measurement error of few cm in distance is achievable. To ensure reliable recording of the timing signals, the counter is synchronized by usinga dual edge synchronization scheme where one of the two flip-flops always has enough delay between data change and clock edge to avoidmetastability problems.

40|$|Preface to the Series The {{object of}} the present series is to make {{available}} accurate digitized data prepared in a uniform way for all recorded strong-motion earthquakes. This first report is the initial step in a continuing data processing program which will ultimately include all past recorded earthquakes as well as current data as it is collected. In addition to digitized ground acceleration records, certain basic calculated information such as integrated velocity and displacement curves, response spectra, and Fourier spectra, will also be issued in a standard form. The existence of this standardized data will allow all investigators {{to begin with the}} same basic numerical data, and should thus reduce the scatter of numerical results, the meaning of which has sometimes been difficult to assess. In addition to an improvement in the consistency of numerical results, several other advantages will be derived from the standardized data. (1) A number of earthquake records will be available which have not hitherto been analyzed in any form; (2) Vertical component data will be available for all earthquakes, digitized on a simultaneous time basis with the two horizontal components; (3) A small overall improvement in data accuracy will result from the inclusion of corrections for baseline distortion on the original record, and for <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> variations; (4) Basic accelerogram data uncorrected for base line adjustments will be available for research purposes, as well as corrected data using standard adjustments. Accurate measurements of the ground motions of destructive earthquakes form the indispensable starting point for invesitgations in earthquake engineering. The number of such measurements that {{have been made in the}} past is unfortunately very small, and there is thus a need to extract the maximum possible information from the relatively few records that do exist. Starting with the first earthquake accelerogram for a destructive earthquake obtained in Long Beach, California, in 1933, the network of accelerographs maintained by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey has gradually accumulated a very important series of accelerograms including some measurements of most of the strong earthquakes occurring in the Pacific Coast States since that time. Although for most of these earthquakes the number of accelerograph records is much smaller than would be desirable, the available records have formed a sound base for the development of current ideas as to the character of destructive earthquake ground motion. The number of such earthquake accelerograms now available for analysis is of the order of one hundred. The importance of the work of the Seismological Field Survey of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in the development, installation, and servicing of accelerographs and in the highly efficient and reliable collection of this basic data cannot be overestimated. In addition, this group has always made available accurate copies of the original accelerograms to interested investigators throughout the world. The size of the USCGS accelerograph network has gradually grown from about 40 instruments in 1935 to some 300 accelerographs in 19690 This has resulted in a gratifying increase in the number of accelerograms, but has emphasized the need for working out a more comprehensive program for the processing of this data. Both instruments and data processing methods have steadily evolved over the years since the beginning of the network, and the matter of establishing uniform procedures has now become of critical importance. Some of the factors which suggest that a uniform preparation of information is now essential are: (1) The basic accelerograph itself has gone through many stages of development, and the network now contains a wide variety of devices differing considerably in mechanical, electrical, and optical details. Although the basic physical parameters are approximately equivalent, there are significant differences which sometimes can be corrected for if the proper information is at hand. (2) A wide variety of recording media and record sizes are employed in the various accelerographs, and many different techniques have been used over the years to digitize the analog photographic traces for numerical work. (3) Various important earthquake accelerograms have been studied by different investigators using different interpretive techniques. In addition, various corrective methods have been employed, and it is not always clear for a given reproduced accelerogram just how the basic data has been treated. (4) As modern digital computing techniques have been developed, there has been a continuous evolution of the data processing techniques used. For example, response spectrum calculations have been carried out by desk calculators, by analog computer methods, and by digital computers. This may complicate the comparison of old spectrum curves with more recent calculations. Integrated velocity and displacement curves are well known to be particularly sensitive to this kind of computational variation. The foregoing factors, plus the fact that highly efficient digitizing and computing facilities are now available, have provided the motive for the present undertaking. The present series will be issued in the following volumes: Volume IDigitized Accelerograms, Uncorrected, with Print-outs and Plotted Records Volume IIDigitized Accelerograms, Base-line corrected. Integrated Velocity and Displacement Curves in Plotted and Digitized Form Volume IIIResponse Spectrum Curves Additional volumes now being planned will present other forms of the basic data of use in earthquake engineering such as Fourier Spectrum curves. Each volume will in turn be issued in parts A, B, C, etc., each containing 20 earthquakes. In this way it is hoped that useful information can be issued as it is prepared, without the delays associated with the completion of the whole project. The project has involved close cooperation at every stage with the Seismological Field Survey of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the methods and formats used have been arrived at after detailed consultation with Mr. William K. Cloud, Chief of the Seismological Field Survey, and his staff. A work of the present type naturally involves important contributions from a large number of people. Some of these will be identified in specific sections and in the reference material. Anything like a complete list of those who have in this way earned the gratitude of future earthquake investigators is obviously impracticable here. It is a pleasure to acknowledge at this point the support of the Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation for the long-range support which makes a project of the present type possible. Introduction to Volume I Uncorrected Digitized Data - Earthquake Ground Accelerations This volume contains the digitized accelerograms of strong earthquake ground motions as processed from records obtained from the strong-motion accelerograph network maintained by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. No base-line or instrumental corrections or adjustments have been made - the data may thus be regarded as "uncorrected" in the sense that no modifications have been introduced which involve any hypotheses as to the character of the ground motions or instruments involved. This digitized data is thus believed to be as close a representation of the original, raw information as it is feasible to achieve with a digital process. A significant feature of the compilation is the fact that uniform data processing methods have been applied to all earthquakes. These methods will now be briefly described. Additional details will be found in Appendix I, which reprints a paper presented at the Fourth World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, Santiago, Chile, in January 1969 As a first step, full size contact film negatives were prepared from the original records which were recorded in the field on photographic paper. This reproduction process was carried out by the staff of the Seismological Field Survey of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in San Francisco, using the original records from the Washington Office of the USCGS. From these film negatives, contact prints were made on a frosted, translucent, Mylar-based film. Measurements have shown that these prints differ in size from the film negatives by less than - 7 - 0. 1 %o, and the distortion involved in going from the original paper record to the contact negative is believed to be no larger than this. The translucent film is mechanically strong, dimensionally stable, and affords excellent optical contrast for setting the cross-hairs on the digitizing machine on a back-lighted glass table. Experiments on photographic development techniques resulted in standard methods for producing an optimum balance between contrast and trace width. Of the approximately one hundred records available, about fourfifths were of good to excellent quality, and permit an accurate digitization with relative ease. About one-fifth are of poorer quality, requiring greater judgment and more effort in the digitizing process, but nevertheless permitting results of satisfactory overall accuracy. The digitizing is performed on a Benson-Lehner 099 D Datareducer unit. The cross-hairs are manually set to successive x-y coordinates on the record trace. The coordinates are converted to digital position figures by means of a magnetic readout head, and are stored in a 6 -digit accumulator system from which they are automatically read out to an electric typewriter and a card punch. The maximum resolution of the system is about 800 digital counts per inch, corresponding to a least time interval on most records of 1 / 300 seconds. The 24 inch table length on the digitizer can accommodate 30 seconds of record at the fastest recording speeds. Most of the accelerograms could be digitized in one position on the digitizer table. For those records requiring repositioning, the points in the record at which changes have occurred are noted, using an arrow on the plotted accelerogram, and an asterisk in the print-out. The records have been digitized on an unequal time basis, which has been found to give the best definition of the trace for a given number of sections and in the reference material. Anything like a complete list of those who have in this way earned the gratitude of future earthquake investigators is obviously impracticable here. It is a pleasure to acknowledge at this point the support of the Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation for the long-range support which makes a project of the present type possible...|$|E

For example, if the timing specified by the manufacturer was set at 12 degrees BTDC initially and adjusted to 11 degrees BTDC, it would be referred to as retarded.

The cosmetic restoration of the 460 was completed in October2016.|$|R
50|$|Players are {{scored on}} the timing {{with which they}} hit the Objects; in {{increasing}} order of accuracy and score, <b>timing</b> can be <b>marked</b> as Good&rarr;Great&rarr;Just. On the contrary, players lose points if they miss an Object. Bonuses are given for a Full Combo (hitting all the Objects) or completing the song with up to 2 misses.|$|R
40|$|The {{seismoscope}} is {{a simple}} instrument designed originally to give a largely qualitative indication of the strong ground motions produced by an earthquake. It consists of a smoked watch glass attached to a two-degree-of-freedom pendulum with a period of Formula sec and damping about 10 per cent of critical; a pen records the pendulum motions on the watch glass. One point on the displacement spectrum of the recorded ground motion at this period and damping is obtained from the measurement of the maximum pendulum excursion. An examination of the seismoscope record obtained on the east abutment of the failed Lower San Fernando dam during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake showed a high-frequency vibration superimposed on the general oscillations. It did not seem likely that this was solely an earthquake vibration component, and shaking table tests of seismoscopes revealed {{the presence of a}} seismoscope vibration mode at frequencies of 15 to 18 Hz depending on the instrument. The oscillations due to this mode on the abutment seismocope record have, therefore, been used as <b>timing</b> <b>marks,</b> to enable the seismoscope equation to be solved for the input acceleration components. The results of the calculations are presented along with analyses of the seismoscope response to indicate the range of applicability. One other record, obtained on a seismoscope alongside a strong-motion accelerograph, was also analyzed for comparison with the recorded accelerations, to demonstrate the validity of the technique. The timing vibration appears on a number of seismoscope records...|$|R
