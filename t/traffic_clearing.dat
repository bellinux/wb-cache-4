The expansion cost NOK90 million and the agreement had a duration for fifteen years, during which time the company received a percentage of revenue from duty-free and parking generated from international services. Lufthavnutvikling was privatized in 2006 and by 2014 there was a controversy regarding the legality of the agreement, following changes to European Union regulations regarding airport subsidies. Further extension of the runway is difficult since the shoreline is at the northwest end of the runway while the flight path to the southeast passes over a water tower that is currently just clear the required safety margins.|$|E

5000|$|When <b>traffic</b> <b>clears</b> they {{complete}} the U-turn {{and go back}} through the intersection. Additionally, the U-turn lane is designed for one-way traffic.

25|$|When the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) reconstructed {{the highway}} to {{encourage}} development {{in the area and}} limit congestion, three lanes were added to the road to create a four-lane highway with turn lanes at the intersection. To limit the impact of the road expansion to businesses on the northern side of the highway, IDOT reduced the distance between the road and the railroad from 60feet to around 30feet (9.1meters). They also erected a modernized traffic signal to ensure <b>traffic</b> <b>cleared</b> the crossing in front of an approaching train. These actions increased the chances of a train impacting a school bus, but were not leading causes.|$|R
50|$|A superstreet, {{also known}} as a {{restricted}} crossing U-turn (RCUT), J-turn, or reduced conflict intersection, is a type of road intersection that is a variation of the Michigan left. In this configuration, traffic on the minor road is not permitted to proceed straight across the major road or highway. Drivers wishing to turn left or go straight must turn right onto the major road, then, a short distance away, queue (wait) into a designated U-turn (or crossover) lane in the median. When <b>traffic</b> <b>clears,</b> they complete the U-turn and then either go straight or make a right turn when they intersect {{the other half of the}} minor road.|$|R
