25|$|Lowry {{claimed to}} have only ever used five colours: Flake White (Lead White), Ivory Black, Vermillion Red, Prussian Blue and Yellow Ochre, all from the art-supply firm Winsor & Newton, but expert {{analysis}} of the paint used in Darby and Joan showed that it contained traces of Zinc White. However, the programme revealed a photograph of Lowry's studio in the 1950s which showed that he did have both <b>Titanium</b> <b>White</b> and Zinc White.

The two colours {{could be achieved}} either by leaving around a quarter {{to a third of}} the vehicle's summer camouflage uncovered, or by repainting the whole vehicle in white with dark gray or gray-brown spots. Units were advised not to paint all their vehicles identically, but to have some tanks all white, some in white with green stripes, and some in white and gray or gray-brown. Winter camouflage was not limited to paint: tracks left in the snow were to be obliterated, vehicles parked in cover, headlights covered with white fabric, shelters constructed, or else vehicles covered with white fabric, or dark fabric scattered with snow.|$|E
