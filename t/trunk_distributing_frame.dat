This paper describes an implementation {{of such a}} <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> buffer for the Intel Paragon routing network, and reports its performance results. We have conducted several experiments with the system we have developed. Our results indicate that placing a multipleport, <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> buffer directly on the host internal routing network can provide high throughput to eliminate the bottleneck of merging a final image from multiple processors to a frame buffer. This architectural approach can also effectively support image composition for sort-last. The synchronization algorithm we have developed requires only one-way communication and minimizes receive overhead for message passing to the frame buffer...|$|R

Especially in TT&C (Telemetry、Tracking and Command) system, it requires incredible precision with time.

This paper proposes two new accordion-type shelters that use modified geometries to improve on the structural stability and stiffness of the typical accordion form. The first shelter is termed a <b>distributed</b> <b>frame</b> accordion shelter and is generated by separating fully folded accordion frames between spacer plates aligned with the transverse direction. A transverse stiffness and increased flexural rigidity can therefore be achieved while maintaining a nonzero floor area. The second shelter is termed a diamond wall accordion shelter and is generated by inserting secondary wall elements that increase wall sectional depth and counteract the coupled rotational-transverse displacements at accordion roof–wall junctions. For both shelter types, a geometric parameterization and a full-scale prototype are presented. Good correlation is seen between the designed and constructed surfaces. A numerical investigation also shows that the new forms have substantially increased flexural rigidities compared to the typical accordion for...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] manuscript presents a novel algorithm to automatically detect landslide movement in a forested area using displacements of tree <b>trunks</b> <b>distributed</b> across the landslide surveyed repeatedly using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Common landslide monitoring techniques include: inclinometers, global position system (GPS), and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). While these techniques provide valuable data for monitoring landslides, they can be difficult to apply with adequate spatial or temporal resolution needed to understand complex landslides, specifically in forested environments. Comparison of the center coordinates (determined via least-squares fit of the TLS data) of a cross section of the tree trunk between consecutive surveys enable quantification of landslide movement rates, which can be used to analyze patterns of landslide displacement. The capabilities of this new methodology were tested through a case-study analyzing the Johnson Creek Landslide, a complex, quick moving coastal landslide, which has proven difficult to monitor using other techniques. A parametric analysis of fitting thresholds was also conducted to determine the reliability of tree trunk displacements calculated and the number of features that were extracted. The optimal parameters in selecting trees for movement analysis were found to be less than 1. 5 cm for the RMS residuals of the circle fit and less than 1. 0 cm for the difference in the calculated tree radii between epochs...|$|R
