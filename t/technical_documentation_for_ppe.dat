40|$|This paper evaluates {{advantages}} of application of digital photogrammetry {{for the purposes}} of production of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> <b>for</b> the objects under protection, comparing it with the classical photogrammetric procedures. Based on gained experiences, paper reviews procedures for the completely digital production of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation.</b> Process of making <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> is divided in two logical stages. First stage comprises of photogrammetric recording, necessary field measurements and production of archive documentation. Archive documentation is in completely digital form and it includes: geometrically rectified photogrammetric photos, data on control points, parameters of exterior orientation for all photos and digital orthophotos as a preliminary source of geometric information. Second stage involves the production of detailed documentation with data describing object geometry such as: floor plans, facades, sections, etc, by using suitable CAD tools. Considering that this constitutes the most complicated and the most expensive part of making <b>technical</b> <b>documentation,</b> this stage is done when needed. Proposed method will be illustrated in paper by using experiences gained on projects of making <b>technical</b> <b>documentations</b> <b>for</b> objects of historical and cultural heritage for the towns of Kragujevac (Serbia and Montenegro) and Banja Luka (Republic of Srpska) ...|$|R
