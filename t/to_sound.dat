5|$|Sound Transit {{approved}} its {{route for}} the light rail project, named Central Link, in November 1999, including {{four of the five}} stations in the downtown transit tunnel (excluding Convention Place). King County Executive Ron Sims proposed transferring ownership of the tunnel, along with $130 million in debt and liabilities for maintenance and operations, from King County Metro <b>to</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit in 2004. The two agencies signed an agreement in May 2000 that formally transferred ownership and responsibility for the tunnel <b>to</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit, in exchange for $195.6 million paid to King County Metro. Metro would retain ownership of Convention Place station and other assets, while Sound Transit would convert the tunnel to rail operation after 2004.|$|E

5000|$|Sound streams {{arriving}} from below the head, above the head, and over behind the head (the vertical plane) are localised again by signal processing {{in the central}} auditory pathways. The cues this time however are the notches/peaks that are added <b>to</b> the <b>sound</b> arriving at the ears by the complex shapes of the pinna. Different notches/peaks are added <b>to</b> <b>sounds</b> coming from below compared <b>to</b> <b>sounds</b> coming from above, and compared <b>to</b> <b>sounds</b> coming from behind. The most significant notches are added <b>to</b> <b>sounds</b> in the 4 kHz to 10 kHz range.

5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by a newly formed regional transit authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running through the Rainier Valley on Martin Luther King Jr. Way with a stop at South Henderson Street to serve Rainier Beach. The $6.7 billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, and the RTA proposed a smaller, $3.9 billion transit system with an at-grade station at South Henderson Street; the new proposal was approved by voters in November 1996. The RTA, which renamed itself <b>to</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit, selected an at-grade alignment for light rail on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South in 1999, with a station at South Henderson Street.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion <b>to</b> <b>sound,</b> were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E

5000|$|Auditory {{adaptation}}, as perceptual adaptation {{with other}} senses, {{is the process}} by which individuals adapt <b>to</b> <b>sounds</b> and noises. As research has shown, as time progresses, individuals tend <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>sounds</b> and tend <b>to</b> distinguish them less frequently after a while. Sensory adaptation tends <b>to</b> blend <b>sounds</b> into one, variable sound, rather than having several separate sounds as a series. Moreover, after repeated perception, individuals tend <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> the point where they no longer consciously perceive it, or rather, [...] "block it out". An individual that lives close to the train tracks, will eventually stop noticing the sounds of passing trains. Similarly, individuals living in larger cities no longer notice traffic sounds after a while. Moving to a completely different area, such as a quiet countryside, that individual would then be aware of the silence, crickets, etc.|$|R

Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E

Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers concert tour.

5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent <b>to</b> <b>sound,</b> and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
