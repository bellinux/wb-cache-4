2500|$|Intaglio [...] is {{a family}} of printmaking {{techniques}} in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by etching, engraving, drypoint, aquatint or mezzotint. Collographs may also be printed as intaglio plates. [...] To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with <b>tarlatan</b> cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes {{with the aid of}} newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.|$|E
60|$|The drummer {{had begun}} to march, closely {{followed}} by the trumpeters. Behind them a bevy of Columbines in many-coloured <b>tarlatan</b> skirts and hair flying wildly in the breeze, giggling, pushing, exchanging ribald jokes with the men behind, and getting kissed or slapped for their pains.|$|E
60|$|The {{procession}} {{came to a}} halt {{in front}} of it, and two hundred pairs of eyes, brimful with simple faith and simple trust, gazed in reverence on the naïve wax figure behind the grating, within its throne of rough stone and whitewash. It was dressed in blue calico spangled with tinsel, and had a crown on its head made of gilt paper and a veil of coarse <b>tarlatan.</b> Two china pots containing artificial flowers were placed {{on either side of the}} little image.|$|E
50|$|Printing a {{photogravure}} {{is similar}} to printing any other intaglio plate, especially a finely etched aquatint. A stiff, oily intaglio printing ink {{is applied to the}} whole surface of the plate with a rubber brayer, or a small, stiff squeegee, or a rolled tamper. The plate is then gently wiped with <b>tarlatans</b> to remove the excess ink and drive it into the recesses (wells). It is finally wiped with the fatty part of the palm of the hand in quick glancing strokes. This removes all remaining ink from the polished highlights and high points and leaves ink only in the etched recesses. After the edges are cleaned, the plate is placed on the printing bed of an intaglio press. It is covered with a sheet of dampened rag paper and then two to three layers of thin wool blankets. It is then run through the press at high pressure. The high pressure pushes the fibers of the dampened paper into the wells of the plate which then transfers the ink onto the paper thereby creating the impression. The paper is carefully peeled off the plate and placed between blotters and weighted so it will dry flat. The plate can now be re-inked for another impression or it can be cleaned for storage.|$|R
60|$|Polly had {{expected}} to be very happy in {{getting ready for the}} party; but when the time came, she was disappointed; for somehow that naughty thing called envy took possession of her, and spoiled her pleasure. Before she left home, she thought her new white muslin dress, with its fresh blue ribbons, the most elegant and proper costume she could have; but now, when she saw Fanny's pink silk, with a white <b>tarlatan</b> tunic, and innumerable puffings, bows, and streamers, her own simple little toilet lost all its charms in her eyes, and looked very babyish and old-fashioned.|$|E
60|$|<b>Tarlatan</b> and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped {{herself in}} them on such occasions, and {{following}} the sensible English fashion of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, {{and all manner of}} dainty devices, which were both inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities.|$|E
6000|$|... "It 's dreadful wicked of me, but I can't help it," [...] {{she sobbed}} to herself, {{in the corner}} of the carriage. [...] "That music sets me all in a twitter, and I should have looked nice in Fan's blue <b>tarlatan,</b> and I know I could behave as well as any one, and have lots of partners, though I 'm not in that set. Oh, just one good gallop with Mr. Sydney or Tom! No, Tom would n't ask me there, and I would n't accept if he did. Oh, me! oh, me! I wish I was as old and homely, and good and happy, as Miss Mills!" ...|$|E
60|$|Of a truth 'twas {{a motley}} throng which began to {{assemble}} on the Place de la Senechaussee, {{just as the}} old bell of the Beffroi tolled the hour of six. Men, {{women and children in}} ragged finery, Pierrots with neck frills and floured faces, hideous masks of impossible beasts roughly besmeared in crude colours. There were gaily-coloured dominoes, blue, green, pink and purple, harlequins combining all the colours of the rainbow in one tight-fitting garment, and Columbines with short, <b>tarlatan</b> skirts, beneath which peeped bare feet and ankles. There were judges' perruqes, and soldiers' helmets of past generations, tall Normandy caps adorned with hundreds of streaming ribbons, and powdered headgear which recalled the glories of Versailles.|$|E
60|$|Her {{dress and}} {{adornment}} {{were marked by}} that exquisite harmony that can come only of a fine natural taste perfected by culture. Her gown was of a simple magenta tulle, cut bias, traversed by three rows of light-blue flounces, with the selvage edges turned up with ashes-of-roses chenille; overdress of dark bay <b>tarlatan</b> with scarlet satin lambrequins; corn-colored polonaise, en panier, looped with mother-of-pearl buttons and silver cord, and hauled aft and made fast by buff velvet lashings; basque of lavender reps, picked out with valenciennes; low neck, short sleeves; maroon velvet necktie edged with delicate pink silk; inside handkerchief of some simple three-ply ingrain fabric of a soft saffron tint; coral bracelets and locket-chain; coiffure of forget-me-nots and lilies-of-the-valley massed around a noble calla.|$|E
60|$|When {{the evening}} {{for the small}} party came, she found that the poplin wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making {{themselves}} very fine indeed. So out came the <b>tarlatan,</b> looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud. No one {{said a word about}} it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.|$|E
6000|$|A {{unanimous}} [...] "O-o-o-o!" [...] {{was heard}} when the curtain rose, but a stern [...] "Hush!" [...] from Thorny kept them mutely staring {{with all their}} eyes at the grand spectacle of the evening. There stood Lita with a wide flat saddle on her back, a white head-stall and reins, blue rosettes in her ears, and {{the look of a}} much-bewildered beast in her bright eyes. But who the gauzy, spangled, winged creature was, with a gilt crown on its head, a little bow in its hand, and one white slipper in the air, while the other seemed merely to touch the saddle, no one could tell for a minute, so strange and splendid did the apparition appear. No wonder Ben was not recognized in this brilliant disguise, which was more natural to him than Billy's blue flannel or Thorny's respectable garments. He had so begged to be allowed to show himself [...] "just once," [...] as he {{used to be in the}} days when [...] "father" [...] tossed him up on the bare-backed old General, for hundreds to see and admire, that Miss Celia had consented, much against her will, and hastily arranged some bits of spangled <b>tarlatan</b> over the white cotton suit which was to simulate the regulation tights. Her old dancing slippers fitted, and gold paper did the rest, while Ben, sure of his power over Lita, promised not to break his bones, and lived for days on the thought of the moment when he could show the boys that he had not boasted vainly of past splendors.|$|E

50|$|The modern tutu is a dress worn as {{a costume}} in a ballet performance, often with {{attached}} bodice. It {{may be made}} of <b>tarlatan,</b> muslin, silk, tulle, gauze, or nylon. Modern tutus have two basic types: the Romantic tutu is soft and bell-shaped, reaching the calf or ankle; the Classical tutu is short and stiff, projecting horizontally from the waist and hip.|$|E
50|$|A Victorian {{mourning}} cap {{was identified}} by its black colour or tone (depending {{on the level}} of mourning). The more recent the loss the simpler the design. The shape of the cap depended on the age of the widow but the most common was peaked at the front.Widows caps, were either lisse, tulle or <b>tarlatan,</b> shape depending mainly on the age. Young widows wore mainly the Marie Stuart shape, but all widows' caps had long streamers. Their prices were various. <b>Tarlatan</b> could be home-made, but widows did not like home-made widows' caps because even though economical, they were ruined quicker than bought caps. It was smart to buy extra streamers and bows for them as they could be used at home to make morning caps,excellent thread and needles being used for the work. In summer a parasol was required which had to be of silk deeply trimmed with crape, almost covered with it, but lace and fringe was not allowed in the first year. Later mourning fringe could be used. A muff, had to be made of dark fur or of Persian lamb.|$|E
50|$|To print a {{carborundum}} print, {{the surface}} is covered in ink, and then {{the surface is}} wiped clean with <b>tarlatan</b> cloth or newspaper, leaving ink only in {{the texture of the}} screen or carborundum. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper. Very large editions are not possible as a small amount of carborundum comes off every time it is wiped down.|$|E
50|$|From 1975 to 1977, Casadesus {{travelled}} to Malaysia, Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia {{and started}} Brûlages et Dessins d'ombre (until 1995). After {{the discovery of}} Georges Seurat, she abandoned sculpture for painting, and developed from 1980 and until 1989 the Tramaturgies inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and School of Fontainebleau. From 1984 to 1990, she began the series Blancs volants and titled after words of the poet Shitao. From 1990 to 2000 she worked on fingerprints and explored {{the theme of the}} materiality of the paint on different paper substrates such as washi, <b>tarlatan,</b> and non-woven textiles.|$|E
50|$|Intaglio is a {{printing}} technique {{in which the}} image is incised into a surface. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used, and the incisions are created by etching or engraving the image, but one may also use mezzotint. In printing, the surface is covered in ink, and then rubbed vigorously with <b>tarlatan</b> cloth or newspaper to remove the ink from the surface, leaving it in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through {{a printing}} press that, through pressure, transfers the ink to the paper.|$|E
50|$|Three to four {{colors of}} ink are mixed, each of a {{different}} viscosity. This viscosity is adjusted {{by the addition of}} uncooked linseed oil. Metal plates, usually copper or zinc, are used, as in the intaglio processes. The artist produces images on the plate by etching lines or textures. The plate is then inked in several stages. The first ink would be fairly dense—of a relatively high viscosity. The application of the high-viscosity ink is carried out as in any intaglio process: by forcing it into the recesses of the plate and then wiping off the plate's surface with a <b>tarlatan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Vitreography was {{initially}} {{conceived of as}} an intaglio process, in which line and tone are carved, engraved or etched into the glass plate’s surface. Printing an intaglio plate involves forcing ink into the grooves and pits, and then wiping the plate’s surface with <b>tarlatan</b> [...] to remove excess ink. The image is transferred to dampened paper under pressure in an etching press. Color intaglio prints are achieved by processing separate plates, each carrying one or more colors {{in proportion to the}} effect desired in the print. The plates are printed in succession onto paper, each carrying color and imagery that, in register with the others, combine to form the finished print.|$|E
5000|$|Printing is {{essentially}} the same as for the other intaglio techniques, but extra care is taken to preserve the burr. After the image is finished, or at least ready to proof, the artist applies ink to the plate with a dauber. Too much pressure will flatten the burrs and ruin the image. Once the plate is completely covered with a thin layer, a <b>tarlatan</b> cloth is used to wipe away excess ink, and paper (typically pages from old phone books) may be used for a final wipe of the lightest areas of the image. Some printmakers will use their bare hand instead to wipe these areas. Once the desired amount of ink is removed, the plate is run through an etching press along with a piece of dampened paper to produce a print.|$|E
50|$|Drypoint wiping {{techniques}} vary {{slightly from}} other intaglio techniques. Less pressure {{is applied to}} achieve desirable lines, because the burrs forming the image are more fragile than etched or engraved lines, {{but also because the}} ink rests on the plate surface, instead of pressed down into indentations. Also, because of the characteristics of the way the burrs catch ink, the direction of the wiping matters. Ink tends to pile up in the lee of the burr during the application of the ink and wiping with the <b>tarlatan,</b> so if the printer wipes {{in the direction of the}} lines with his hand, he may remove most of the ink, leaving a light gray line. However, if he wipes perpendicularly to the line, he can actually increase the pile of ink on the other side of the line, darkening the printed line.|$|E

50|$|To print an {{intaglio}} plate, ink {{is applied}} to the surface by wiping and/or dabbing the plate to push the ink into the recessed lines, or grooves. The plate is then rubbed with <b>tarlatan</b> cloth to remove most of the excess ink. The final smooth wipe is often done with newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top of the plate, so that when going through the press the damp paper will be able to be squeezed into the plate's ink-filled grooves. The paper and plate are then covered by a thick blanket to ensure even pressure when going through the rolling press. The rolling press applies very high pressure through the blanket to push the paper into the grooves on the plate. The blanket is then lifted, revealing the paper and printed image.|$|E
5000|$|A {{piece of}} matte board, a plastic [...] "card", or {{a wad of}} cloth {{is often used to}} push the ink into the incised lines. The surface is wiped clean with a piece of stiff fabric known as <b>tarlatan</b> and then wiped with {{newsprint}} paper; some printmakers prefer to use the blade part of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb. The wiping leaves ink in the incisions. You may also use a folded piece of organza silk to do the final wipe. If copper or zinc plates are used, then the plate surface is left very clean and therefore white in the print. If steel plate is used, then the plate's natural tooth gives the print a grey background similar to the effects of aquatinting. As a result, steel plates do not need aquatinting as gradual exposure of the plate via successive dips into acid will produce the same result.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of original print methods to be aware of. Intaglio prints: for example a dollar bill—bills and most stamps are engraved in metal plates and are printed after a viscous ink (about the consistency of oil paint) is forced into grooves, scratches, etched lines or indentations. The polished surface is then wiped clean using newsprint and <b>tarlatan,</b> leaving ink only below plate level. The plate is then covered with a dampened paper and felt blankets. It is run through the press where great pressure (approximately 8 tons to the square inch) pushes the dampened paper down into the engraved or etched grooves to pick up ink. In other words, in intaglio we see printed what is {{below the surface of the}} plate and the ink is now embossed on the paper. Among the greatest masters of engraving and etching are Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Rembrandt, Goya, and Picasso.|$|E
5000|$|Printing {{the plate}} {{is done by}} {{covering}} the surface with printing ink, then rubbing the ink off the surface with <b>tarlatan</b> cloth or newsprint, leaving ink in the roughened areas and lines. Damp paper {{is placed on the}} plate, and both are run through a printing press; the pressure forces the paper into contact with the ink, transferring the image (c.f., chine-collé). Unfortunately, the pressure also subtly degrades the image in the plate, smoothing the roughened areas and closing the lines; a copper plate is good for, at most, a few hundred printings of a strongly etched imaged before the degradation is considered too great by the artist. At that point, the artist can manually restore the plate by re-etching it, essentially putting ground back on and retracing their lines; alternatively, plates can be electro-plated before printing with a harder metal to preserve the surface. Zinc is also used, because as a softer metal, etching times are shorter; however, that softness also leads to faster degradation of the image in the press.|$|E
40|$|By {{investigating}} {{the connections between}} drawing, object and memory, this research project operates as an enquiry into processes of transition and transformation, and the significance of everyday objects to memory. Through practices of process‐based drawing, I focus on aged domestic objects to explore relationships between materiality and our awareness of and insights into past experience. I approach the drawing and casting of objects {{as a metaphor for}} the mental processes we experience in relation to memory. The project is supported by research into theories of memory, with particular focus on the capacity of memory to shift and change over time, and how the merging of past and present relates to the creation of new realities. The practical research has resulted in a body of work that consists of a series of photocopy drawings, rubbings and three‐dimensional forms made from liquid latex, wax and <b>tarlatan</b> fabric. The development of tangible, delicate forms and imagery reveals alternate approaches in drawing to create modified shapes and surfaces of domestic objects. The diverse works reflect the fluctuating processes of memory, evoking new meanings from prior experiences. The works are also an intimate, personal response to the vulnerable materiality of the objects from which they originate. For my practical research I have drawn on a number of philosophical approaches from the following sources: Edward Casey’s research into the change‐inducing processes of remembering in Remembering: A Phenomenological Study; Paul Ricoeur’s focus on the persistence of enduring traces in Memory, History, Forgetting; Henri Bergson’s philosophies regarding memory as an embodied experience in Matter and Memory; Michael Leyton’s ideas on the importance of shape to memory in Symmetry, Causality, Mind; and Maurice Merleau‐Ponty’s theories on embodied consciousness, touch as sensory surface, and the connection between memory and the material world in Phenomenology of Perception. My study of this material has expanded my approach to drawing and my perception of an object’s materiality and its connection to the past. The contextual background includes selected works of three artists – Eva Hesse, Giorgio Morandi and Louise Bourgeois. The sculptural paper and latex forms of Hesse’s studio works (1966 – 1969) express the potential of open‐ended exploration within forms that appear incomplete, and their suggestive uncertainty has influenced my experimentation with ambiguity. Giorgio Morandi’s intimate still life paintings and drawings, and particularly his initial treatment of studio objects, have been influential in terms of my experimentation with trace and enduring marks. The fabric works of Louise Bourgeois (2000 ‐ 2009) are a material expression of autobiographical memory and inspired my investigations of material potency in my studio work. This research project expands on theoretical ideas that frame the ambiguous zone of the past and the present in memory. It emphasises strategies of making aligned with concepts of transformation, intimacy and the ephemeral. The partial and collapsed nature of the works, the use of disparate and yielding materials, and the capacity of the two and three‐dimensional forms to be read as matter in transition demonstrates their potential as catalysts for new form and meaning. The project acknowledges the everyday object as a valuable referent for the complexities of memory and domestic items as a source for shape. The innovative application of drawing techniques undertaken within the studio research contributes to an ongoing pursuit within contemporary drawing practice to transform traditional drawing language into new art forms...|$|E
