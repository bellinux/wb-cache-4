5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of a {{viscous fluid}} {{in the space}} between two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> {{to be well}} defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature.

For a smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E
