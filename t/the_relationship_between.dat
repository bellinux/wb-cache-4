30|$|To summarize, first, {{regardless}} of <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KIC and organizational effectiveness or <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KIC and organizational commitment, no significant effects were found. <b>The</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KPC and organizational effectiveness and <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KPC and organizational commitment have significant effects. Meanwhile, KPC, through organizational commitment, positively influences organizational effectiveness. Our findings confirm that KMC is not solely sufficient to drive organizational effectiveness and that organizations {{also need to}} encourage organizational commitment.|$|R

The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E
