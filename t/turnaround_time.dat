The Hunter also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records. The type was also lauded for its quick <b>turnaround</b> <b>time,</b> enabled by features such as its removable gun pack, pressurised fuelling system, and easy handling in flight.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: While {{several factors}} {{have been shown to}} {{influence}} operating room (OR) turnaround times, few comparisons of planned and actual OR <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> have been performed. This study aimed to compare planned and actual OR <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> at a large rural hospital in Northern Germany. Methods: This retrospective study examined the OR turnaround data of 875 elective surgery cases scheduled at the Marienhospital, Vechta, Germany, between July and October 2014. The frequency distributions of planned and actual OR turnaround times were compared and correlations between <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> and various factors were established, including the time of day of the procedure, patient age and the planned duration of the surgery. Results: There was a significant difference between mean planned and actual OR <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> (0. 32 versus 0. 64 hours; P < 0. 001). In addition, significant correlations were noted between actual OR <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> and the time of day of the surgery, patient age, actual duration of the procedure and staffing changes affecting the surgeon or the medical specialty of the surgery (P < 0. 001 each). The quotient of actual/planned OR <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> ranged from  1. 733 – 3. 000. Conclusion: Significant discrepancies between planned and actual OR <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> were noted during the study period. Such findings may be potentially used in future studies to establish a tool to improve OR planning, measure OR management performance and enable benchmarking...|$|R
40|$|Recently many editors try {{to reduce}} the <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> of {{academic}} journals. Shorter <b>turnaround</b> <b>times,</b> however, will induce many additional submissions of low-quality papers, increasing significantly the workload of editors and referees, {{and the number of}} rejections prior to publication. I suggest several ideas how editors can shorten <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> and four ideas how they can still avoid frivolous submissions, thus improving the review process efficiency: higher submission fees; requiring authors to review papers in proportion to their submissions; using differential editorial delay – letting low-quality papers wait more; and banning papers from being submitted after a certain number of rejections.

5|$|The Isinglass/Rheinberry {{concept was}} {{considered}} to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways, including rapid <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> and quick response capability. As there was little funding to be had from the CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although technical support gleaned from Oxcart was supplied by the CIA. The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar to the Space Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction.|$|E
5|$|Orizaba made15 transatlantic voyages for the Navy {{carrying}} {{troops to}} and from Europe in World War I with the second-shortest average in-port <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> of all Navy transports. The ship {{was turned over to}} the War Department in 1919for use as Army transport USAT Orizaba. After her World War I service ended, Orizaba reverted to the Ward Line, her previous owners. The ship was briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York–Cuba–Mexico service until 1939, when the ship was chartered to United States Lines. While Orizaba was in her Ward Line service, American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from the rear deck of the liner off Florida in April 1932.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut <b>turnaround</b> <b>time.</b> The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E
40|$|Histopathology {{laboratories}} aim {{to deliver}} high quality diagnoses based on patient tissue samples. Indicators for quality are {{the accuracy of}} the diagnoses and the diagnostic <b>turnaround</b> <b>times.</b> However, challenges exist regarding employee workload and <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> in the histopathology laboratory. This paper proposes a decomposed planning and scheduling method for the histopathology laboratory using (mixed) integer linear programming ((M) ILP) to improve the spread of workload and reduce the diagnostic <b>turnaround</b> <b>times.</b> First, the batching problem is considered, in which batch completion times are equally divided over the day to spread the workload. This reduces the peaks of physical work available in the laboratory. Thereafter, the remaining processes are scheduled to minimize the tardiness of orders. Preliminary results show that using this decomposition method, the peaks in histopathology workload in UMC Utrecht, a large university medical center in the Netherlands, are potentially reduced with up to 50 % by better spreading the workload over the day. Furthermore, <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> are potentially reduced with up to 20 % compared to current practices...|$|R

5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E

Thanks to the extremely short <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> at ports, the service speed of the vessel could be lower than that of normal ships, resulting in lower fuel expenses.|$|E
25|$|The Javelin was {{reportedly}} easy to fly even on one engine. The flight controls were fully power-assisted and production aircraft adopted a hydraulic 'feel' {{system for the}} pilot. The Javelin featured an infinitely variable airbrake; the airbrake proved to be extremely responsive and effective, allowing pilots to conduct rapid descents and heavy braking manoeuvres, enabling equally rapid landings to be performed. The <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> between sorties was significantly shorter than with the preceding Gloster Meteor, due to improved ground accessibility and engine ignition sequence. Unlike the Meteor, the Javelin was fitted with ejector seats, at the introduction to service of the type.|$|E

25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms {{of the use of}} bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summitted after the usual 14:00 <b>turnaround</b> <b>time.</b> He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.|$|E
25|$|The Polish {{campaign}} {{was a success}} for an aircraft considered obsolete by the Luftwaffe high command. Within a year, the Hs 123 was again in action in the blitzkrieg attacks through the Netherlands and France. General Heinz Guderian was continually impressed by the quick <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> offered by II.(Schl)/LG 2. Often positioned as the Luftwaffes most-forward based combat unit, the Hs 123 flew more missions per day than other units, and again proved their worth in the close-support role. With Ju 87s still being used as tactical bombers rather than true ground support aircraft and with no other aircraft capable of this mission in the Luftwaffe arsenal, the Hs 123 was destined to continue in service for some time more, although numbers were constantly being reduced by attrition.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Team {{performance}} {{has been studied}} extensively in the perioperative setting, but the managerial impact of interprofessional team performance remains unclear. We hypothesized that the interplay between anesthesiologists and surgeons would affect operating room <b>turnaround</b> <b>times,</b> and teams that worked together over time would become more efficient. METHODS We analyzed 13, 632 surgical cases at our hospital that involved 64 surgeons and 48 anesthesiologists. We detrended and adjusted the data for potential confounders including age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, and surgical list (scheduled cases of specific surgical specialties). The surgical lists were categorized as ear, nose, and throat surgery; trauma surgery; general surgery; and gynecology. We assessed the relationship between <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> and assignment of different anesthesiologists to specific surgeons using a Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS We found significant differences in team performances among the different surgical lists but no team learning. We constructed managerial decision tables for the assignment of anesthesiologists to specific surgeons at our hospital. We defined a decision algorithm based on these tables. Our analysis indicated that had this algorithm been used in staffing the operating room for the surgical cases represented in our data, median <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> would have a reduction potential of 6. 8...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPreoperative biopsies or {{imbedded}} cytological cells {{will become}} more and more a primary source of tissue for molecular diagnostic analyses as a result of novel neo-adjuvant treatment regimens for several cancer types. Furthermore there is a growing need to examine metastatic cancer tissue. Hence, nucleic acids need to be reliably isolated and analyzed from small amounts of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. The limited numbers of (tumor) cells in these samples make high quality and sensitive DNA isolation challenging. Also demands for faster <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> are growing. Therefore, we evaluated a fully automated DNA/RNA isolation system and compared this with a manual, classical routine molecular pathology method. We compared the quality of the isolates from both tissue cores and micro-dissection for detection of hotspot mutations in KRAS, BRAF applying hydrolysis probe assays. In addition we determined whether the automated method decreases the hands-on-time and <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> in routine molecular pathology workflow. In conclusion, the automated method delivers high quality DNA from both small FFPE tissue cores and micro-dissected tissue material. In comparison to classical methods, less than 50 % of starting tissue was sufficient as input for micro-dissection. <b>Turnaround</b> <b>times</b> decreased significantly and 50 % less hands-on time was needed...|$|R
