Novel water-soluble oleoyl acetyl chitosan (OACh) was synthesized using oleoyl chloride reacted with acetic anhydride in pyridine. The chemical structure of the OACh was characterized by FT-IR, 1 H an...|$|E
5000|$|The process {{started from}} 2,4,5-trimethylbenzyl {{chloride}} 1, which was pyrolyzed at 700 °C to give benzocyclobutene 2 and further pyrolyzed to the cyclooctane dimer 3. Rieche formylation afforded 4 (after separation from other regioisomers), aldehyde reduction using sodium borohydride gave diol 5, and then chlorination using <b>thionyl</b> chloride) gave <b>dichloride</b> 6. Another pyrolysis gave tetrabridged cyclophane 7, another formylation reaction gave dialdehyde 8, another reduction/chlorination sequence gave dichloride 9, {{and a final}} pyrolysis gave superphane 10 as hard white crystals with melting point 325-327 °C.|$|R
