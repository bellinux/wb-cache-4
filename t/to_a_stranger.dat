25|$|The {{practice}} of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations {{is called the}} T–V distinction and in English {{is largely due to}} the influence of French. This began with the {{practice of}} addressing kings and other aristocrats in the plural. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, tu was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger,</b> potentially insulting), while the plural form vous was reserved and formal.|$|E
25|$|In Medieval Europe, a woman's {{parents could}} {{forcibly}} marry her <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> without her consent, and, {{once she was}} married, {{she could no longer}} refuse to consent to sex: the medieval concept of rape did not allow for the possibility of being raped by one's husband. In 1563, the Council of Trent expressly declared that legal Catholic marriages had to be done with consent of both parties, but did not require parental consent, essentially declaring forced marriages invalid. This was not universally accepted: for example, in France, women were not granted the right to marry without parental consent until 1793.|$|E
25|$|Healthy {{humans have}} two kidneys, a {{redundancy}} that enables living donors (inter vivos) {{to give a}} kidney to someone who needs it. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger.</b> Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system.|$|E

She spent her first day on a sunny beach lamenting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> that she wished she had the time to meet Mr. Right, get married and have kids. Unbeknownst to her, the stranger was a man from her past who was in love with her when they met years ago.

25|$|According to Leviticus, {{anyone who}} comes {{into contact with}} or carries any {{creature}} that hadn't been deliberately killed by shechita was regarded by the biblical regulations as having made themselves unclean by doing so, and therefore was compelled to immerse their entire body. This regulation is immediately preceded by the rule against eating anything still containing blood, and according to biblical scholars {{this is also the}} context of the regulation about not eating non-sacrifices - that the regulation only treats such consumption as unclean if there is a risk of blood still remaining within the carcass. In the version of this regulation in Deuteronomy, eating the bodies of such creatures isn't described as making an individual ritually impure, nor requires the eater to wash their body, but instead such consumption is expressly forbidden, although the creature is allowed to be passed on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger,</b> who is permitted to eat it.|$|E

After talking <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> at a bar about family – not knowing that the man is Jane's father Donald (John de Lancie) – Walt goes to Jesse's apartment and finds him and Jane passed out in a heroin stupor. Walt accidentally turns Jane over and causes her to choke on her own vomit, but he does nothing to save her and watches her die. Walt has Saul clear any connection Jesse has to Jane's death, and convinces Jesse to enter rehab.|$|E

500|$|Mendelssohn {{suffered}} from poor {{health in the}} final years of his life, probably aggravated by nervous problems and overwork. A final tour of England left him exhausted and ill from a hectic schedule. The death of his sister Fanny on 14 May 1847 caused him great distress. Less than six months later, on 4 November, Mendelssohn himself died in Leipzig after a series of strokes. He was 38. His grandfather Moses, his sister Fanny and both his parents had died from similar apoplexies. Felix's funeral was held at the Paulinerkirche, Leipzig, and he was buried at the Dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof I in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The pallbearers included Moscheles, Schumann and Niels Gade. Mendelssohn had once described death, in a letter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger,</b> as a place [...] "where it is to be hoped there is still music, but no more sorrow or partings".|$|E

Graynor related to both characters, saying that [...] "I've had many nights as Caroline. And I've had many nights as Norah, taking care of Caroline."

500|$|In July 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the 6000th episode of Neighbours would see Paul pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. This then kicks off a whodunit storyline with Diana being one of six suspects. Susan Bower said that as the Neighbours team was developing the storyline, they decided to add to the story that Paul's financial situation leads to him embezzling, which in turn leads to Diana arriving. Badler said it was [...] "great" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline and said she was largely featured in the 6000th episode. [...] Diana becomes a suspect in the attempt on Paul's life because he jilts her [...] "in the boardroom and the bedroom". Paul then humiliates Diana and sends her packing from Lassiter's. On Diana's reason to kill Paul, Badler said [...] "Seeing her name splashed across the Erinsborough News prompts Diana to pull out all the stops in order to bring Paul down. And she still has friends in high places!" [...] Diana is seen placing a call asking for something to be taken care of and she hands money over <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> just before Paul is pushed. Following the attempt on Paul's life, Diana's earring is found at the scene and the police manage to catch her at the airport before she returns to America. Diana diverts the police attention to Rebecca by telling them that she revealed Paul's affair to her.|$|E

500|$|The {{return of}} a wife after 18years results in Michael Henchard's {{downfall}} in Thomas Hardy's novel Mayor of Casterbridge (1886). [...] A bad-tempered, impulsive and cruel husband, feeling burdened by his wife, Henchard sells her <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> for five guineas. [...] He becomes a successful businessman and rises {{to the position of}} mayor, but the return of his wife many years later prompts his fall back into penury. [...] The custom was also referred to in the 19th-century French play, Le Marché de Londres. Commenting on the drama and contemporary French attitudes on the custom, in 1846 the writer Angus B. Reach complained: [...] "They reckon up a long and visionary list of our failings [...] would as readily give up their belief in the geographical and physical existence of London, as in the astounding fact that in England a husband sells his wife exactly as he sells his horse or his dog." [...] Such complaints were still commonplace nearly 20years later; in The Book of Days (1864), author Robert Chambers wrote about a case of wife selling in 1832, and noted that [...] "the occasional instances of wife-sale, while remarked by ourselves with little beyond a passing smile, have made a deep impression on our continental neighbours, [...] constantly cite it as an evidence of our low civilisation." [...] Embarrassed by the practice, a legal handbook of 1853 enabled English judges to dismiss wife selling as a myth: [...] "It is a vulgar error that a husband can get rid of his wife by selling her in the open market with a halter round her neck. Such an act on his part would be severely punished by the local magistrate." [...] Originally published in 1869, Burn's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer states that [...] "publicly selling or buying a wife is clearly an indictable offence... And many prosecutions against husbands for selling, and others for buying, have recently been sustained, and imprisonment for six months inflicted".|$|E
