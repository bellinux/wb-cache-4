5|$|Early SEGRAs were {{synthetic}} steroids. An {{example is}} RU24858, {{one of the}} first compounds of this <b>type</b> <b>to</b> be published. Many newer SEGRAs have a different framework, although the similarity to steroids can still be seen in molecules like the benzopyranoquinoline A276575 or in octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivatives. All of these compounds have been shown to exhibit SEGRA properties in cellular or in animal models.|$|E
5|$|Insects are prey for {{a variety}} of organisms, {{including}} terrestrial vertebrates. The earliest vertebrates on land existed 400 million years ago and were large amphibious piscivores. Through gradual evolutionary change, insectivory was the next diet <b>type</b> <b>to</b> evolve.|$|E
5|$|After the {{government}} of Nova Scotia established a lifesaving station on Sable Island in 1801, workers trained some of the horses to haul supplies and rescue equipment. Lifesaving staff recorded the importation of a stallion, Jolly, taken there in 1801, who was probably similar in <b>type</b> <b>to</b> the original Acadian horses released on the island. Although Jolly {{was not the first}} horse on the island, {{he was the first to}} be identified by name in historic records, and is known to have survived on the island until at least 1812. Other breeding stock, probably including horses of Thoroughbred, Morgan and Clydesdale breeding, were sent to the island during the first half of the 19th century, in the hopes of improving the type of horses found on the island and raising the price for which they could be sold on the mainland.|$|E

His partner Wren Howard took papier-mâché moulds of the <b>type</b> <b>to</b> Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus Press was shipping its edition to the London bookseller Leopold Hill, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves soon {{came to the attention of}} the Home Office. On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the book to be seized.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new {{locomotive}} <b>type</b> <b>to</b> replace its aging fleet of Di 3 diesel-electric locomotives, which {{made up the}} back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as freight and passenger trains on the Nordland Line, {{and to a lesser}} extent on the Røros Line. In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five Di4 from Henschel. Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued, as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the United States Army Air Forces, {{which became}} the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1947, {{developed}} a requirement for a new, large assault glider <b>type</b> <b>to</b> replace smaller types that were then in service, all existing gliders having been declared obsolete. The new gliders were to be constructed entirely of metal, and were also required to be easily adaptable to a powered configuration. As part of a five-year development program, a contract was awarded to the Chase Aircraft Company of Trenton, New Jersey, in August 1946 {{for the construction of}} two types of gliders. These included a smaller model being designated XCG-18A, and the larger, definitive model being designated XCG-20.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Airbus tested three {{styles of}} winglet {{intended}} {{to counteract the}} wing's induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design <b>type</b> <b>to</b> be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft {{were used in the}} flight test evaluation campaign– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.|$|E
5|$|In November 1995, after abandoning {{development}} of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing {{announced that it was}} revisiting studies for a larger 767. The proposed 767-400X, a second stretch of the aircraft, offered a 12percent capacity increase versus the 767-300, and featured an upgraded flight deck, enhanced interior, and greater wingspan. The variant was specifically aimed at Delta Air Lines' pending replacement of its aging Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, and faced competition from the A330-200, a shortened derivative of the Airbus A330. In March 1997, Delta Air Lines launched the 767-400ER when it ordered the <b>type</b> <b>to</b> replace its L-1011 fleet. In October 1997, Continental Airlines also ordered the 767-400ER to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet. The type completed its first flight on October 9, 1999, and entered service with Continental Airlines on September 14, 2000.|$|E

5|$|The 1470-class Pacific was {{the third}} Great Northern {{locomotive}} <b>type</b> <b>to</b> incorporate Gresley's universal 3-cylinder layout. All three cylinders drove the middle coupled axle. The outside cranks were set at 120°, with the inside crank displaced by about 7 degrees {{to allow for the}} 1:8 inclination of the inside cylinder. Gresley conjugated valve gear derived the motion of the inside valve spindle from the two outside valve spindles: this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of valve gear between the frames. A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three-bar version of the Laird slide-bar. However, Gresley adopted this type of slide-bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs.|$|E
5|$|The SECR Nclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-0 ("mogul") steam {{locomotive}} designed in 1914 by Richard Maunsell for mixed-traffic duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). Built between 1917 and 1934, {{it was the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) <b>type</b> <b>to</b> use and improve upon the basic design principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The Nclass was based on the GWR 4300 Class design, improved with Midland Railway concepts.|$|E
5|$|The coins were minted {{under three}} dynasties of Roman emperors. The {{earliest}} are the successors of the Constantinian dynasty, {{followed by the}} Valentinianic emperors, and finally the Theodosian emperors. The collegiate system of rule (or Consortium imperii) meant that imperial partners would mint coins in each other's names at the mints under their jurisdiction. The overlapping reigns of Eastern and Western emperors often allow changes of <b>type</b> <b>to</b> be dated to within part of a reign. So the latest coins in the hoard, of Western ruler Honorius (393–423) and his challenger Constantine III (407–11), can be demonstrated {{to belong to the}} earlier parts of their reigns as they correspond to the lifetime of the Eastern Emperor Arcadius, who died in 408. Thus, the coins provide a terminus post quem or earliest possible date for the deposition of the hoard of 408.|$|E

Fifty-two per cent of the listeners thought Ruth should go to Sam. The Archers website had received 1.2 million page impressions due to the storyline in 2006. In February 2007, {{a writer for the}} Daily Record reported almost 200,000 listeners had deserted The Archers due to controversial storylines, such as Ruth and Sam's affair. The writer said figures for the last three months of 2006, when the Ruth and Sam storyline peaked, revealed 4.44 million listeners tuned in, which was down 169,000 on the previous quarter. Whitburn told Midgley that the backlash from listeners helped keep Ruth faithful to David, and agreed that she was not the <b>type</b> <b>to</b> have an affair.|$|E
5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). The task is {{to determine how much}} of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, in order to minimize cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any <b>type</b> <b>to</b> accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E
5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the <b>type</b> <b>to</b> give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E
