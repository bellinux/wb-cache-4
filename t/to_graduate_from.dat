40|$|The {{internal}} rate {{of return}} to schooling is a fundamental economic parameter that is often used to assess whether expenditure on education should be increased or decreased. This article considers alternative approaches to estimating marginal internal rates of return for different schooling levels. We implement a general nonparametric approach to estimate marginal internal rates of return that take into account tuition costs, income taxes, and nonlinearities in the earnings‐schooling‐experience relationship. The returns obtained by the more general method differ substantially from Mincer returns in levels and in their evolution over time. They indicate relatively larger returns <b>to</b> <b>graduating</b> <b>from</b> high school than <b>to</b> <b>graduating</b> <b>from</b> college, although both have been increasing over time. ...|$|R
