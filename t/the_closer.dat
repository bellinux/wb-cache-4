In 2007, he went 45 and had a 3.42 ERA and 19 saves (out of 24 opportunities).|$|E

5|$|A post-war {{review by}} the Australian government's Defence Committee {{recommended}} that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; Terrible and sister ship Majestic, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As Terrible was fitted out as a flagship and was <b>the</b> <b>closer</b> of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification.

Central El Chal contains 25 groups, Arrepentimiento contains 40 groups, Panorama contains 53 groups and Municipal contains 18 groups. Panorama was an area of chert production while Municipal is associated with the ritual complex of the city.|$|E
