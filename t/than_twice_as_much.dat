5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the bunkers cost more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the Maginot Line in France, consuming {{three times as much}} concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E

Some of the major signs and symptoms are mental deterioration, jerky movements, and seizures specially myoclonic type, involuntary movements, and/or behavioral changes, difficulty in walking, speech, and loss of cognition, respiratory distress and death. Materials and Methods During the ten years, from July 1991 to July 2001, we admitted 45 cases of (SSPE), at different stages of the disorder. Regardless of their stage of disease, for intervention, randomly, we used one of three drugs; Amantadin, Interferon alfa and Isoprinosine, administered to the patients, for between one month to one year. Fourteen cases received Amantadin, 15 Alfa interferon, and 16 were given Isoprinosine.

40|$|Part I. The first {{enantioselective}} {{synthesis of}} the chiral bisnaphthopyrone natural product nigerone and its enantiomer, ent-nigerone, has been achieved. The synthesis of nigerone highlights the asymmetric oxidative biaryl coupling with 1, 5 -diaza-cis-decalin copper complexes that {{was developed by the}} Kozlowski group. It was found that constrained 2 -naphthols were necessary to produce the highly functionalized chiral 1, 12 ̆ 7 -binaphthols in high enantioselectivity. The key eight-step isomerization process to form the natural product proceeded with retention of the biaryl configuration. The axial configurations of bisisonigerone and nigerone were definitively established through a combination of circular dichroism (CD) measurements and quantum chemical CD calculations. * ^ Part II. Catalytic, enantioselective Claisen rearrangements have been studied. The first of the [3, 32 ̆ 7] sigmatropic rearrangements utilized a bisamidinium catalyst, featuring a dual hydrogen-bonding array that can coordinate a singular oxygen atom on the Claisen substrate. It was found that the dual hydrogen donor was key, as acceleration of the Claisen rearrangement was far greater <b>than</b> with using <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of a mono hydrogen bond donor. * ^ Next, the first catalytic, enantioselective Meerwein-Eschenmoser Claisen rearrangement has been developed. Both copper(II) and palladium(II) catalysts were employed. The reaction was optimized to afford the oxindole product bearing a quaternary stereocenter at C 3 in high enantiomeric excess. * ^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|R
40|$|A growing {{scarcity}} of irrigation water could progressively lead {{to changes in}} rice production to systems using less irrigation water for rice or more crop diversification. A shift from current production of rice on flooded soils to production of rice on non-flooded soil with water-saving irrigation or to production of more water-efficient crops will have profound effects on carbon, water, and energy exchanges. This study used the eddy covariance technique to examine C uptake and water use efficiencies for water-saving, dry-seeded rice production and production of hybrid maize under overhead sprinkler irrigation {{as an alternative to}} flooded rice during two growing seasons. Maize with its C 4 physiology has greater photosynthetic capacity than rice. In 2011, maize had 1. 4 times higher net C uptake <b>than</b> rice and <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> grain yield <b>as</b> rice (10. 4 vs 5. 3 Mg ha− 1). In 2012, lower solar radiation due to increased cloudiness and heavy rainfall during critical growth stages (late vegetative to early reproductive) decreased LAI and resulted to about 20 % less net C uptake and maize yield (8. 2 Mg ha− 1), but the rice yield was unchanged (5. 3 Mg ha− 1) presumably because of improved crop management which included effective crop establishment at lower seed rate and efficient N application using fertigation. Canopy light use efficiency, crop water productivity (WPET), and photosynthetic water use efficiency were 1. 8, 1. 9, and 1. 6 times higher for maize than rice, respectively, despite sensitivity of maize to excess water. Net C uptake, evapotranspiration, and WPET of dry-seeded rice under overhead sprinkler irrigation were comparable to those reported elsewhere for flooded rice. Average total water input (irrigation + rainfall) for rice was only 908 mm, as compared to 1300 – 1500 mm reported in literature for typical puddled transplanted rice...|$|R
