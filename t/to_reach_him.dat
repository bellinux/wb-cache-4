Therefore, Schweitzer played {{a vital role in}} his work, acting as a possible influence. In the first nine months, Schweitzer and Albert had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>him.</b> In her time in Africa, she worked as nurse and helped with the hospital. She played an essential part in sanitation efforts, especially by preparing medical equipment for surgery. Schweitzer was an anaesthetist for surgical operations.|$|E
5|$|In Okaloosa County, up to 1,267 {{residents}} {{lost power}} during the storm. Most {{of the residents}} had their power restored within a few hours; however, due to continuing wind damage, scattered power outages, affecting up to 500 homes at a time, occurred throughout the county. Throughout the county, roughly $25,000 was sustained in flood losses. A second fatality occurred after a man was knocked off his ship near the coast of Bay County. Rescuers managed <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>him</b> but during the rescue, he fell off the life raft and was lost. The search was later called off as he was presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|When Catherine {{finds her}} {{colleague}} dead, she flees {{from the company}} premises and finds her husband, who has deduced that her job offer was simply a way for Odessa <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>him.</b> Elsewhere, an Odessa agent murders the Old Man in Frank's home; the loss serves to reunite Watts, Means and Black, who contrive a plan to strike back at Odessa. As the Elder conducts a funeral for the Old Man, a carbomb kills his assassin, while Odessa's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight's company is raided and closed. The Elder finishes his rites and returns home, opening a package delivered from the Middle East; inside is the fragment of the True Cross.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, Raiders' long snapper Jon Condo {{was injured}} and was {{backed up by}} Travis Goethel, a linebacker for {{a game against the}} San Diego Chargers. On two {{occasions}} during the game, punter Shane Lechler was unable to handle snaps that had bounced prior <b>to</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>him.</b> On another attempt, Lechler took his position much closer to the line of scrimmage than is normal for a punter so as to decrease the distance Goethel needed to accurately snap the ball. Though the snap was adequate, the decreased distance resulted in a block.|$|R
60|$|Bill punched at 'im {{over the}} bar, {{and not being}} able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>'im</b> threw Peter's pot o' beer at 'im. There was a fearful to-do then, and the {{landlord}} jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway, whistling for the police. Bill struck out right and left, and the men in the bar went down like skittles, Peter among them. Then they got outside, and Bill, arter giving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the whistle, jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter 'im.|$|R
5|$|A lucky break allowed 3rd Battalion to ambush {{the staff}} car {{carrying}} Generalmajor Friedrich Kussin, the German commandant of Arnhem, {{and kill him}} and his driver. Nevertheless, most of the battalion had been stopped by the Germans in Oosterbeek while 'C' Company had entered Arnhem but were halted on the road leading to the bridge. At 15:30 the 1st Parachute Battalion were released from the reserve and directed along the Ede-Arnhem road. Here they first encountered German armoured vehicles and a column of five tanks and fifteen half-tracks, which were engaged by the battalion. They continued fighting their way forward, and by morning had reached the outskirts of Arnhem. By this time around {{a quarter of the}} battalion had been killed, wounded or were missing. Before this, at nightfall, Brigadier Lathbury had contacted Lieutenant-Colonel Frost in command at the bridge and informed him the brigade would stay put during the night and attempt <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>him</b> in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Taleba Bay {{force on}} Stuart {{transferred}} to Tieryo, a ship's launch and a ship's whaleboat, and was ashore by 03:30 on 23 October. They captured a Japanese machine gun position at about 06:00. Two platoons went south {{where they were}} engaged by Japanese forces. The Japanese were driven beyond Niubulu Creek, but a heavy Japanese counterattack from the north at 09:00 inflicted casualties on the Australians and forced them {{to withdraw from the}} area. Gategood broke radio silence and attempted to contact Arnold on the 108 set, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>him.</b> After this, they came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, which inflicted heavy casualties. Having lost six men killed and ten wounded, with three more posted as missing, the Australians were forced to fall back under pressure from the pursuing Japanese. Lieutenant Clifford Hoskings would later receive the Military Cross for silencing a Japanese machine gun in the ensuing fighting. Faced with being overrun, Gategood withdrew his force even further, at first back to Taleba Bay, and then to Mud Bay aboard Stuart, arriving on 24 October.|$|E

Kenshin loses the will to live and when Sanosuke is unable <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>him,</b> he wanders away from Tokyo. In his wandering, he is reunited with his family in the Shinano Province (Shinshū). Years {{prior to the start of}} the series, Sanosuke left the family at the age of 9 to join the Sekihō Army. Although he does not reveal his {{identity}} to his family, upon learning of their poor situation Sanosuke attacks a former Ishin Shishi who was mistreating them and the town. During these fights, Sanosuke's right hand is permanently damaged from the overuse Futae no Kiwami. and overcomes this disability when he discovers using both hands in succession which lessens the impact to his damaged hand. After protecting his family, he returns to Tokyo to rescue Kaoru with his friends. After a successful rescue, Sanosuke leaves Japan and travels the world to avoid being arrested for attacking the Ishin Shishi. The manga ends with a letter from Sanosuke to his friends that he is returning to Japan to be reunited with them.|$|E

5|$|Passing over Okinawa with {{a central}} {{pressure}} of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg), Bolaven {{became one of the}} most intense typhoons to ever strike the region. Off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture, swells from the typhoon battered fishing vessels and knocked the captain of one ship overboard. Although a rescue helicopter was quick <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>him,</b> he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Just off the coast of Jogashima Misaki-cho in Miura, Kanagawa, two boys were swept away by large swells. A mother attempted to swim after them to save them but later drowned. The two boys were later rescued with minor injuries by the Coast Guard. Although the storm did not strike the Japanese mainland, its outer bands brought showers and thunderstorms to parts of Kyushu. Due to the rains, rail service in Saga Prefecture was temporarily suspended, affecting 4,200 passengers. In Isahaya, one person was injured after being struck by a billboard downed by high winds. Throughout Japan, losses to agriculture and fisheries amounted to ¥423.28million (US$5.39million).|$|E

At another time, when he stood {{in the midst of the}} eleven, as they were troubled with the thoughts of unbelief, he said, 'Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have' (John 20:27; Luke 24:39).|$|R

25|$|Third is {{the case}} of Captain Tenodor Ten Eyck.

The French Governor of Brittany, the Duc d'Aiguillon had gathered a force at Vannes with the intention of coming to the aid of Belle Île, but British frigates kept a vigilant watch of the coast, and the British dominance of the surrounding seas made any chance of a crossing unlikely. The French government moved fresh reinforcements to mainland Brittany, fearing that this would be the next target of the British.|$|E

25|$|By 14 December 1914 the Admiralty had {{advance warning}} of the {{intended}} raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby through signals intelligence.

On 16 December, as the situation developed, the submarines were ordered {{to move to the}} Heligoland Bight in order to intercept returning German ships. They failed, although one torpedo was fired at SMS Posen by HMS E11, which missed. As a last-ditch attempt to catch Hipper, the Admiralty ordered Keyes to take his two destroyers and attempt to torpedo Hipper as he returned home around 2 am. on 17 December.
