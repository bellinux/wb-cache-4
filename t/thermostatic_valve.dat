Computer simulations in IDA ICE 4 are used and case studies are performed {{in order to find}} the possible savings. Conventional control with outdoor sensors only and equivalent temperature control without weather forecast are the two reference systems for comparison. The differences in result when having functioning and non-functioning <b>thermostatic</b> radiator <b>valves</b> are also investigated. The construction of weather forecast control is described in more general terms in the theory part and the self-constructed weather forecast control implemented in IDA is furthermore described in detail. The building simulated in IDA is a multi-family dwelling constructed in three floors with a concrete frame, built in the early 1970 ’s. The simulations are performed using the most weather exposed apartment in the building. Both the simulation in IDA and the case studies indicate that weather forecast control can save 15 kWhheat/(m 2 ∙year). Implementing weather forecast control in a conventional system regulated by outdoor air temperature control and with no <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> functioning saves almost the same amount of energy as if new <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> would have been installed, according to the results from IDA. Calculating the total net savings shows that installing new <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> is somewhat better than weather forecast control. The net savings per year when installing new <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> and using weather forecast control is 331 SEK and 290 SEK respectively in the apartment simulated. Installing weather forecast control in a conventionally controlled building with all <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> functioning is not economically feasible when using the self-constructed equivalent temperature in IDA...|$|R

The fuel system uses a FACET MA 3PA carburetor, equipped with carburetor heat. Electrical {{power is supplied}} by a Prestolite alternator. The ignition system is driven by dual Bendix Scintilla S5LN magnetos; the starter motor is also by Prestolite.

50|$|Treated {{fresh water}} {{is used for}} cooling of the cylinder, charge air, turbocharger, and oil. Freshwater cooling {{is divided into two}} systems the HT (High Temperature) cooling the {{cylinders}} and turbocharger and the LT (Low Temperature) cooling the oil and charge air. The freshwater temperature is closely regulated with a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valve</b> to achieve optimum efficiency. At low engine loads the charge can be too cool, which can cause incomplete combustion. To counteract this heat rejected to the lubrication oil can be used to heat the freshwater, which in turn heats the charge air enough to ensure complete combustion.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the cooling air may range from well below freezing to 50 °C. Further, while engines in long-haul boat or rail service may operate at a steady load, road vehicles often see widely varying and quickly varying load. Thus, the cooling system is designed to vary cooling so the engine is neither too hot nor too cold. Cooling system regulation includes adjustable baffles in the air flow (sometimes called 'shutters' and commonly run by a pneumatic 'shutterstat); a fan which operates either independently of the engine, such as an electric fan, or which has an adjustable clutch; a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valve</b> or just 'thermostat' that can block the coolant flow when too cool. In addition, the motor, coolant, and heat exchanger have some heat capacity which smooths out temperature increase in short sprints. Some engine controls shut down an engine or limit it to half throttle if it overheats. Modern electronic engine controls adjust cooling based on throttle to anticipate a temperature rise, and limit engine power output to compensate for finite cooling.|$|E

5000|$|These systems {{depend on}} the proper {{operation}} of <b>thermostatic</b> air-venting <b>valves</b> located on radiators throughout the heated area. When {{the system is not}} in use, these valves are open to the atmosphere, and radiators and pipes contain air. When a heating cycle begins, the boiler produces steam, which expands and displaces the air in the system. The air exits the system through the air-venting valves on the radiators and on the steam pipes themselves. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> close when they become hot; in the most common kind, the vapor pressure of a small amount of alcohol in the valve exerts the force to actuate the valve and prevent steam from leaving the radiator. When the valve cools, air enters the system to replace the condensing steam.|$|R

This paper aims at presenting an investigation methodology, useful for designers and other stakeholders involved in hospital energy refurbishments, based on an integrated approach which combines dynamic energy performance simulations and experimental campaigns. In order to measure all the simulations' missing input parameters, a suitable experimental analysis, including measurements of temperature, humidity, flow rate and density of construction materials, is performed.
