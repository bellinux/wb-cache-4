The Whigs and Republicans complained because they favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called {{for an increase in}} tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were only enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress. The tariff issue was and is sometimes cited–long after the war–by Lost Cause historians and neo-Confederate apologists. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the tariff issue. Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff, and when some did, for instance, Matthew Fontaine Maury and John Lothrop Motley, they were generally writing for a foreign audience.|$|E

2500|$|Concerned that President Johnson viewed Congress as an [...] "illegal body" [...] {{and wanted}} to {{overthrow}} the government, Republicans in Congress took control of Reconstruction policies after the election of 1866. Johnson ignored the policy mandate, and he openly encouraged southern states to deny ratification of the 14th Amendment (except for Tennessee, all former Confederate states did refuse to ratify, as did the border states of Delaware, Maryland and Kentucky). Radical Republicans in Congress, led by Stevens and Sumner, opened the way to suffrage for male freedmen.

2500|$|In reality, {{neither the}} US Army nor US Navy was {{in shape for}} war in terms of manpower, size, {{military}} hardware or experience. The Navy had fine ships but Wilson had been using them to threaten Mexico, and the fleet's readiness had suffered. The crews of the Texas and the New York, the two newest and largest battleships, had never fired a gun, and {{the morale of the}} sailors was low. The Army and Navy air forces were tiny in size. Despite the flood of new weapons systems unveiled in the war in Europe, the Army was paying scant attention. For example, it was making no studies of trench warfare, poison gas or tanks, and was unfamiliar with the rapid evolution of Aerial warfare. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> tried to cut the military budget in 1915. The Preparedness movement effectively exploited the surge of outrage over the [...] "Lusitania" [...] in May 1915, forcing the Democrats to promise some improvements to the military and naval forces. Wilson, less fearful of the Navy, embraced a long-term building program designed to make the fleet the equal of the British Royal Navy by the mid-1920s, although this would not come to pass until after World War II. [...] "Realism" [...] was at work here; the admirals were Mahanians and they therefore wanted a surface fleet of heavy battleships second to none—that is, equal to Great Britain. The facts of submarine warfare (which necessitated destroyers, not battleships) and the possibilities of imminent war with Germany (or with Britain, for that matter), were simply ignored.|$|E

50|$|By 1913 {{with the}} new income tax {{generating}} revenue, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> were able to reduce rates with the Underwood Tariff.

50|$|Throughout the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, AEI staff have pushed for a more conservative approach to aiding the recession that includes major tax-cuts. AEI supported President Bush’s tax cuts in 2002 and claimed that the cuts “played a large role in helping to save the economy from a recession”. AEI also suggested that further taxes were necessary in order to attain recovery of the economy. An AEI staff member said that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>congress</b> who opposed the Bush stimulus plan were foolish for doing so as he saw the plan as a major success for the administration.|$|E

The South had almost no complaints but the low rates angered many Northern industrialists and factory workers, especially in Pennsylvania, who demanded protection for their growing iron industry.

5000|$|While public {{attention}} focused on supplies from the Middle East, the main source was actually Canada.
