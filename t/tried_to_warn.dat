5|$|With {{the rest}} of his army, Theophilos then marched to interpose himself between the Cilician Gates and Ancyra, camping on the north bank of the river Halys, close to one of the major river crossings. Ashinas crossed the Cilician Gates on 19 June, and the caliph himself with his main army set out on the march two days later. The Arab advance was slow and cautious. Anxious to avoid an ambush and learn the emperor's whereabouts, Mu'tasim forbade Ashinas to advance too deeply into Cappadocia. Ashinas sent out many {{scouting}} detachments to take captives, and from them finally learned of Theophilos's presence at the Halys, where he awaited the Arab approach to give battle. At the same time, around mid-July, Theophilos learned of the arrival of Afshin's army, comprising some 30,000 men, at the plain of Dazimon. Leaving a part of his army under a relative to watch the crossings of the Halys, Theophilos immediately departed with most of his army, some 40,000 men according to Michael the Syrian, to confront the smaller Arab force. Mu'tasim learned of Theophilos's departure from captives and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> Afshin, but the emperor was faster and met Afshin's army in the Battle of Anzen on the plain of Dazimon on 22 July. Despite initial success, the Byzantine army broke and scattered, while Theophilos with his guard were encircled and barely managed to break through and escape.|$|E

25|$|The ship got {{underway}} at 9:30am. As it {{was passing}} East 90th Street, a fire {{started in the}} Lamp Room in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. It was fueled by the straw, oily rags, and lamp oil strewn around the room. The first notice of a fire was at 10:00am; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> him earlier, but was not believed.|$|E

25|$|On May 14, the Dutch {{commander}} at Rotterdam, Colonel Scharroo, {{received an}} ultimatum: {{if he did}} not surrender, the town would be bombed. As the ultimatum was not signed, Scharroo sent it back. A few hours later, he received another ultimatum, this time duly signed by General Schmidt, the German commander at Rotterdam. Schmidt did not know that a squadron of bombers was already on its way to bomb Rotterdam. The Germans <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> the bomber crews by shooting red flares, but only half of the squadron noticed this; the other half continued on their mission and dropped their bombs on the city (see the Rotterdam Blitz).|$|E
25|$|At 8:04p.m., Cst. Douglas Larche, who was plain-clothed {{but also}} wearing body armour, and {{armed with a}} shotgun, responded at Mailhot Avenue. There, he was spotted by Bourque, who then {{concealed}} himself behind several trees and fired four shots at him, wounding him. Larche returned fire with seven shots from his service pistol.

The entire exchange of gunfire lasted for 70 seconds. Bourque then fled the scene at 8:13p.m. and escaped into the woods behind Isington Avenue. He had been last sighted near Ryan Street and Wheeler Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|While {{navigating}} the Elbe about eight miles above Brunsbuttel {{she was given}} permission to proceed until Cuxhaven {{at the mouth of}} the North Sea. There was no pilot ship available to take her through the minefield at Cuxhaven so she attempted to proceed on her own along the usual channel. Tugboat men of the harbour <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> San Wilfridos master about the danger by shouting. The master then tried to evade the mines by attempting to go full speed astern. However, at approximately four p.m., a strong ebb tide carried San Wilfrido into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making it the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away and made them prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Another legend {{alleges that}} a common sailor on the flagship, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> Shovell that the fleet was off course but Shovell had him hanged at the yardarm for inciting mutiny. The story first {{appeared}} in the Scilly Isles in 1780, with the common sailor being a Scilly native, who recognized the waters as being close to home but was punished for warning the admiral. While it is possible that a sailor may have debated the vessel's location and feared for its fate (such debates were common upon entering the English Channel, as noted by Samuel Pepys in 1684), the story has been repeatedly discredited by naval scholars, who noted the lack of any evidence in contemporary documents, its fanciful stock conventions and dubious origins. After his death Shovell became a popular British hero.|$|E
25|$|Instead of condoning the Romanian- and German-led {{mass murder}} of Ukrainian and Bessarabian Jews (see Holocaust in Romania), Pântea is {{credited}} with having saved many of the potential victims—probably numbering in the thousands. On October 22, 1941, Pântea issued a proclamation in Odesskaya Gazeta, promising a return to normal, and announced freedom and equality between all Odessans. However, this statement was rendered ineffectual by events which occurred on the same day: an explosion on Marazlie Street took the life of General Ioan Glogojeanu and other Romanian officials. The Antonescu regime supposed a terrorist attack, ignoring all accounts according to which the retreating Red Army had mined the location. Reportedly, Pântea and his Transnistrian colleague Nichita Smochină were informed of the mining, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> their superiors not to enter the Marazile building.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the raid}} went well, and they met no {{resistance}} entering the town. They cut the telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended {{by a single}} watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including Colonel Lewis Washington, great-grandnephew of George Washington. They also spread the news to the local slaves that their liberation was at hand. Things started to go wrong when an eastbound Baltimore & Ohio train approached the town. The train's baggage master <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> the passengers. Brown's men yelled for him to halt and then opened fire. The baggage master, Hayward Shepherd, became the first casualty of Brown's war against slavery. Ironically, Shepherd was a free black man. Two of the hostages' slaves also died in the raid. For some reason, after the shooting of Shepherd, Brown allowed the train to continue on its way.|$|E
