5|$|Each club {{needed to}} get past five rounds to reach the showpiece event at Wembley. Both clubs made {{comfortable}} progress; Luton scored 14 goals and conceded three, Arsenal {{on the other hand}} conceded two fewer. Luton for the final were without Darron McDonough who injured himself in training, but David Preece and Ricky Hill both returned to the side after lengthy periods of treatment. Goalkeeper Les Sealey was not fit in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> so Andy Dibble deputised in goal for only his sixth appearance of the season.

5|$|Manningham Rugby Football Club, {{formed in}} 1876, {{originally}} played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle Road area of Bradford.

The new ground and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, Valley Parade, a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham.

5|$|On 6 March, during United's 3–1 loss against Liverpool at Anfield, Nani {{was injured}} {{following}} a challenge from Jamie Carragher just before half-time. Nani shed tears after {{the challenge and}} was subsequently taken off the pitch in a stretcher. Following post-match comments to the press from Manchester United, it was believed Nani had suffered a broken leg. However, {{this was not the}} case as he started training the following week. It was thought Nani would miss up to three weeks as a result of this tackle and would return in April, but he recovered in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 61 minutes of a 2–1 victory over Marseille on 15 March.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{bright spots}} in this stretch was Iginla, who {{captured}} the Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies in 2001–02 as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points. Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy, tied with Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk, with 41 goals in 2003–04. Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman Robyn Regehr who became the youngest nominee ever for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. Regehr had suffered two broken legs {{in a car accident}} the summer of 1999, but recovered in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 57 games at the age of 19.|$|E

5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E
5|$|After Cristiano Ronaldo's {{transfer}} to Real Madrid in the 2009 close season, {{the weight of}} expectation was on Nani to step up from bit part player and replace his compatriot. Nani's first contribution to United's new season was opening the scoring in the tenth minute of the 2009 FA Community Shield, but United eventually lost the match on penalties after a 2–2 draw. Nani suffered a dislocated shoulder during the match, which was originally expected {{to keep him out}} of the start of the season. He recovered in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 17 minutes for Portugal against Liechtenstein on 12 August, however, and started the match against Birmingham City on 16 August. Although he provided the assist for Wayne Rooney's winning goal in the 34th minute, Nani was replaced by Ryan Giggs at half-time. On 22 August, Nani scored his first league goal of the 2009–10 season, a free-kick against Wigan Athletic in a 0–5 away win.|$|E
5|$|Confident that he {{was being}} {{targeted}} by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.|$|E

He made his debut for Swindon against Grimsby Town, when he had a goal disallowed. Rhodes played just four games for Swindon all as {{substitute}} without scoring before returning to Brentford, before being immediately placed on the transfer list by Brentford manager Scott Fitzgerald.

Rhodes was offered a new contract by new Brentford manager Terry Butcher but turned it down and left the club on 25 June 2007. He played 65games in all competitions for Brentford, but two-thirds of those were as substitute, scoring just six goals.|$|E
5|$|In 1967–68, {{his second}} season, {{injuries}} limited Orr to just 46 {{games in which}} he scored 11 goals and had 20 assists. Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks in a cast. In December, a Frank Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr's collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in his left knee. In February, {{he had to leave}} a game against Detroit after his left knee went stiff.

Orr did return to finish the season, but required an operation during the off-season to remove a bone chip. Despite the injuries, Orr won the first of a record eight consecutive Norris trophies and was named to the NHL's First All-Star team and finished fourth in the voting for the Hart Trophy.|$|E
