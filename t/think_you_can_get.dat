When your back foot doesn't flip the board properly, you feel like a complete moron; or I do. You feel like you just started skating, and, ah, just coming off an injury, that's the last thing you need. Make sure you kick it every time, so that everybody will <b>think</b> you're sweet. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on video and go on Strange Notes. Peace out." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to {{investigate}} what preschool teachers now about children in crisis and and how to manage crisis. It´s also about what children in preschool understand about death. Literature studies {{have been made to}} get a better idea about what to do when you {{are in the middle of}} a crisis situation and to find out how children reacts when they are in grief. Four preschool teachers have been interviewed from two different preschools and three children at the same preschool. The interviews show theire knowledge about preschool children in crisis and how to deal whit the crisis. The interview with the children show if they have any experience with death and if they know it´s final. The result shows that there is some knowledge among the preschool teachers about crisis and how to deal with them, but they don´t <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> enough knowledge. When it comes to the children they have had some experience with deaths and they are aware of that when you die it´s final...|$|R
60|$|WILLIE. Do {{you stand}} there and ask me what about it, and haven't the sense to alter it? Couldn't you set up a proper Government to-morrow, if you liked? Couldn't you {{contrive}} that the pits belonged to you, instead of you belonging to the pits, like so many old pit-ponies that stop down till they are blind, and take to eating coal-slack for meadow-grass, not knowing the difference? If only you'd learn to <b>think,</b> I'd respect <b>you.</b> As you are, I can't, not if I try my hardest. All <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of is to ask for another shilling a day. That's as far as your imagination carries you. And perhaps you get sevenpence ha'penny, but pay for it with half-a-crown's worth of sweat. The masters aren't fools--as you are. They'll give you two-thirds of what you ask for, but they'll get five-thirds of it back again--and they'll {{get it out of}} your flesh and blood, too, in jolly hard work. Shylock wasn't in it with them. He only wanted a pound of flesh. But you cheerfully give up a pound a week, each one of you, and keep on giving it up.--But you don't seem to see these things. <b>You</b> can't <b>think</b> beyond your dinners and your 'lowance. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> another shilling a day you're set up. You make me tired, I tell you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' she said. 'In a way, one is of {{the world}} if one lives in it. But isn't it really an {{illusion}} to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out of it? After all, a cottage in the Abruzzi, or wherever it may be, isn't a new world. No, {{the only thing to}} do with the world, is to see it through.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{down with}} them, momma?" [...] the girl asked, and somehow her mother's heart was {{lightened}} by her evasion, {{not to call}} it uncandor. It was at least not morbid, {{it was at least}} like other girls, and Mrs. Kenton imparted what comfort there was in it to the judge, when he asked where she had left Ellen.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt. And if you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> it, I {{advise you}} to stick to it. If you thought you could get it you would say the same.

It ain't for myself that I'm {{speaking}} now, because I'm a-going to get it,--I think I'm a-going to get it;--it's for humanity at large. This kind of thing wiolates one's best feelings." ...|$|E
60|$|Say--a {{friend of}} mine wants to write a play with me, I to furnish the broad-comedy cuss. I don't know {{anything}} about his ability, but his letter serves {{to remind me of}} our old projects. If you haven't used Orion or Old Wakeman, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> and I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> together and grind out a play with one of those fellows in it? Orion is a field which grows richer and richer the more he mulches it with each new top-dressing of religion or other guano. Drop me an immediate line about this, won't you? I imagine I see Orion on the stage, always gentle, always melancholy, always changing his politics and religion, and trying to reform the world, always inventing something, and losing a limb by a new kind of explosion {{at the end of each}} of the four acts. Poor old chap, he is good material. I can imagine his wife or his sweetheart reluctantly adopting each of his new religious in turn, just in time to see him waltz into the next one and leave her isolated once more.|$|R
6000|$|I {{felt she}} must see at this {{juncture}} how wonderful I found her, and even that that impression--one's whole consciousness of her personal victory--was a force that, in the last resort, was all on her side. [...] "It was quite worth your while, this sitting up to this hour, to show a fellow how you bloom when other women are fagged. If that was really, with the truth that we're so pulling about laid bare, what you did most want to show, why, then, you've splendidly triumphed, and I congratulate and thank you. No," [...] I quickly went on, [...] "I daresay, to do you justice, the interpretation of my tropes and figures isn't 'ever' perfectly simple. You doubtless have driven me into a corner with my dangerous explosive, and my only fair course must be therefore to sit on it till {{you get out of}} the room. I'm sitting on it now; and I <b>think</b> you'll find <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out as soon as you've told me this. Was the moment your change of view dawned upon you the moment of our exchanging a while ago, in the drawing-room, our few words?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I <b>think</b> sometimes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|R
