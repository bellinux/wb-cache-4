50|$|Back <b>belts,</b> <b>or</b> {{lumbar support}} <b>belts,</b> are {{generally}} lightweight belts worn around {{the lower back}} to provide support to the lumbar. Industrial back belts tend {{to be similar to}} weight lifting <b>belts</b> <b>or</b> special <b>belts</b> used in medical rehabilitation therapy. Back belts are popular among workers across a number of industries—airline baggage handlers, warehouse workers, grocery clerks, etc.—specifically to prevent lifting injuries.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> De <b>Belt</b> is a hamlet in the Dutch {{province}} of North Holland. It {{is located on}} the former island of Wieringen.|$|R
50|$|A webbed <b>belt,</b> {{military}} <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> skater <b>belt</b> {{is a type}} of belt {{distinguished by}} its belt buckle design and lack of holes in the cord, which is usually found in other belts where a pin is used as the fastening mechanism in the belt buckle.|$|R
5000|$|Belting: <b>Belting</b> <b>or</b> <b>belt</b> {{quality is}} a complex setup {{combining}} speech quality, twang quality, a tilted cricoid cartilage and raised larynx. Twang {{is an important component}} in belt quality. Gillyanne Kayes writes, 'Belting is not harmful if you are doing it right. Jo Estill has described it as [...] "happy yelling".' Belt quality also uses clavicular breathing and has the longest closed phase with the highest subglottic pressure and the greatest glottic resistance.|$|R
50|$|Orion's <b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> the <b>Belt</b> of Orion, {{also known}} as the Three Kings or Three Sisters, is an {{asterism}} in the constellation Orion. It consists of the three bright stars Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka.|$|R
50|$|Weighted chin-ups — {{weight is}} added {{dangling}} from a dipping <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> via weighted <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> vest, ankle weights, chains, medicine ball between the knees, dumbbell between the feet or kettlebells {{on top of}} the feet.|$|R
5000|$|In the 20th century, {{local economies}} {{in these states}} {{specialized}} in large-scale manufacturing of finished medium to heavy industrial and consumer products, {{as well as the}} transportation and processing of the raw materials required for heavy industry. The area was referred to as the Manufacturing <b>Belt,</b> Factory <b>Belt,</b> <b>or</b> Steel <b>Belt</b> as distinct from the agricultural Midwestern states forming the so-called Corn Belt and Great Plains states that are often called the [...] "bread-basket of America".|$|R
50|$|A tectonic unit of {{uncertain}} {{position is}} the Zemplinic in the horst of the Zemplín Mts., {{emerging from the}} Cenozoic sedimentary fill of the Eastern Slovakia Basin. The Zemplinic is according to some authors either assigned to the separate <b>belts</b> (Zemplín <b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> Sub-Vihorlat <b>Belt)</b> <b>or</b> considered {{as a part of}} the separate terrane Tisia-Dacia. Some geologists assign it to the Southern Veporic, the Gemeric unit, or even to the Eastern Carpathians. The Zemplinic is the only place of occurrence of the Precambrian rock in the Western Carpathians. They are composed of the paragneisses, amphibolites, and migmatites, together with Post-Hercynian Carboniferous and Permian conglomerates and thin beds of black coal.|$|R
50|$|Keychains that {{currently}} hold keys are an item that is never long misplaced by the owner. People sometimes attach their keychain to their <b>belt</b> (<b>or</b> <b>belt</b> loop) to avoid loss or to allow quick access to it. Many keychains also offer functions {{that the owner}} wants easily accessible as well. These include an army knife, bottle opener, an electronic organizer, scissors, address book, family photos, nail clipper, pill case and even pepper spray. Modern cars often include a keychain {{that serves as a}} remote to lock/unlock the car or even start the engine. An electronic key finder is also a useful item found on many keys that will beep when summoned for quick finding when misplaced.|$|R
50|$|There are two Agroclimatic {{zones in}} Haryana. The North-Western part (also {{referred}} as Paddy belt) which {{is suitable for}} Rice, Wheat, Vegetables and Temperate Fruits, and the South-Western part (also referred as the Cotton <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> Dry <b>belt)</b> which is suitable for Cotton, Millets, coarse cereals, tropical fruits, exotic vegetables and herbal & medicinal plants.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid nineteenth century, Okolona and the {{surrounding}} Black Prairie, sometimes called the Black <b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> Prairie <b>Belt,</b> became {{what has been called}} the [...] "Bread Basket of the Confederacy". The area was part of the original Cotton Belt of Mississippi well before the more famous Delta region gained fame for major cotton production.|$|R
5000|$|A garter <b>belt</b> (AmE), <b>or</b> {{suspender}} <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> suspenders (BrE), is {{the most}} common way of holding up stockings.

50|$|Golden <b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> Shah's Coronation <b>Belt</b> is a 119 cm {{belt with}} a unique 176 carat emerald on it. It is also {{decorated}} by 60 brilliant diamonds and 145 other type diamonds. It is currently kept in the National Treasury of Iran in Tehran.|$|R
50|$|Traditional boats use an inboard motor {{powering}} a propeller {{through a}} propeller shaft complete with bearings and seals. Often a gear reduction {{is incorporated in}} order to be able to use a larger more efficient propeller. This can be a traditional gear box, coaxial planetary gears <b>or</b> a <b>transmission</b> with <b>belts</b> <b>or</b> chains. Because of the inevitable loss associated with gearing, many drives eliminate it by using slow high-torque motors. The electric motor can be encapsulated into a pod with the propeller and fixed outside the hull (saildrive) or on an outboard fixture (outboard motor).|$|R
50|$|In recent decades, {{the less}} {{specific}} division between Eastern and Western Denmark {{has also become}} common, for example when describing logistic, economic and political patterns. Funen {{may be attributed to}} both the eastern and western part of the country, the border line being either the Great <b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> the Little <b>Belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clinton carried every {{county in}} the state, but showed {{particular}} strength in the region in Central Alabama known as the Black <b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> the Cotton <b>Belt</b> where the share of African American voters is highest, including the city of Birmingham. She also showed strength {{in and around the}} city of Mobile including Mobile Bay, along the Gulf Coast.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belting</b> (<b>or</b> vocal <b>belting)</b> is a {{specific}} technique of singing by which a singer brings their chest register above its natural passaggio (break) at a loud volume; instead, an alternative production is developed, often described and felt as supported and sustained yelling. 'Belting' is sometimes described as 'high chest voice' but this is technically incorrect and potentially damaging for the voice. It {{is often described as}} a vocal register, although this is also technically incorrect; it is rather a descriptive for the use of a register. Singers can use belting to convey heightened emotional states.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{atmosphere}} white dwarfs {{with metal}} lines, so-called DAZs, require external accretion of material {{to explain the}} presence of weak metal line absorption in their photospheres. The source of this material is currently unknown, but could come from the interstellar medium, unseen companions, or relic planetesimals from asteroid <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> Kuiper <b>belt</b> analogues. Accurate mid-infrared photometry of these white dwarfs provide additional information {{to solve the mystery}} of this accretion and to look for evidence of planetary systems that have survived post main sequence evolution. We present Spitzer IRAC photometry accurate to ∼ 3...|$|R
5000|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Stern has argued that location should not matter and only geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term [...] for a planet-sized object orbiting another planet. Likewise planet-sized objects in the asteroid <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> Kuiper <b>belt</b> should also be planets according to Stern. Others have used the neologism planemo (planetary-mass object) for the broad concept of [...] "planet" [...] advocated by Stern.|$|R
50|$|A fold {{and thrust}} belt {{is a series}} of mountainous foothills {{adjacent}} to an orogenic belt, which forms due to contractional tectonics. Fold and thrust belts commonly form in the forelands adjacent to major orogens as deformation propagates outwards. Fold and thrust belts usually comprise both folds and thrust faults, commonly interrelated. They are commonly also known as thrust-and-fold <b>belts,</b> <b>or</b> simply thrust-fold <b>belts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Folk CostumesHistorically {{the most}} {{commonly}} used men's costume was the kilt or the fustanella, which had been in use up until the Proclamation of Independence of 1912. In the later period, looser clothing started to become the trend. Men wore long sleeve shirts accompanied by artistically sewed vests. Trousers were loosely knitted with wool and were black or dark brown. White trousers were used on significant events and holidays. Also included in the costume was a long woolen <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> leather <b>belt,</b> woolen socks and cow leather sandals or moccasins decorated with tufts at the front.|$|R
50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> {{ammunition}} <b>belt</b> is {{a device}} used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm. Belts {{and the associated}} feed systems are typically employed to feed machine guns or other automatic weapons. Belt-fed systems minimize the proportional weight of the ammunition to the feeding device along with allowing high rates of continuous fire. The capacity of belts and carriers is typically a function of weight and bulk. Their size is limited by caliber and the portability of the combined weapon and ammunition. The most common sizes typically carried on a man-portable weapon run from 50 to 300 rounds.|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> coffee <b>belt.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> {{ammunition}} <b>belt</b> is {{a device}} used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm commonly used on machine guns. Belts were originally composed of canvas or cloth with pockets spaced evenly {{to allow the}} belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due {{to the effects of}} oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during feeding. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Some notable weapons that use belts are the M240, the M249, the M134 Minigun, and the PK Machine Gun.|$|R
