40|$|Security of {{the mobile}} network Fabian van den Broek We {{looked at the}} {{security}} of the wireless connection between mobile phone and cell towers and suggested possible improvements. The security was analysed on a design level, by looking at the protocols and encryption techniques, but also on an implementation level by looking at {{the security of the}} software that handles the mobile communication. Furthermore, we examined systems that rely on the security of the mobile network, such as <b>transaction</b> <b>codes</b> transmitted using SMS. The most important improvement we suggest, makes it impossible to track a user's location based on his permanent identity in the mobile network. This improvement also allows GSM phones to verify whether they are communicating with an authentic cell tower, thereby fixing the biggest security flaw in GSM. This improvement can be introduced by individual providers without the rest of the network needing any changes or even noticing the change. We are currently working with the GSM Association (GSMA) to get this improvement into the mobile specifications...|$|E
30|$|Program {{analysis}} {{is also used}} to speed up transactions. Sloth [11] and Pyxis [10] are tools that use program analysis to reduce the network communication between the application and DBMS. QURO [42] tracks dependencies among transaction statements to reorder transaction execution for 2 PL. DORA [30] also partitions <b>transaction</b> <b>codes</b> to exploit intra-transaction parallelism provided by multi-core server for 2 PL. Majority of these techniques do not consider reordering transaction execution and thus cannot reduce delays for transaction pipeline. QURO seems the most related approach to PARE since both of them reorder transaction execution. However, two inappropriate design choices of QURO hinder transaction pipeline from boosting HFT applications: (1) QURO assumes fixed workloads and requires to sample the degrees of contention for each statement in advance. Unfortunately, workload sampling is prohibitive because each transaction is dynamically generated according to the timely business information in HFT market. (2) QURO estimates the degree of contention at statement level and by the delayed time. As discussed in Sect.  3.3, this underestimates the degree of contention and repeatedly obtains inconsistent degree of contention. In contrast, PARE estimates at physical operator level and counts the occurrence frequency of contention.|$|E

First, we observe and formulate harmful ordering of statements in <b>transaction</b> <b>code</b> and propose to eliminate harmful ordering by rearranging statements in decreasing order of the degree of contention. To this end, we devise two mechanisms. On the one hand, to preserve serializability after reordering, we devise a reordering block extraction algorithm.

40|$|Private {{international}} law applies to cases governed by private law which involve factual connections with several countries. A major issue governed by private {{international law}} {{is the question of}} which country’s law should be applied to determine the merits of a dispute. This thesis focuses on choice of law in respect of transnational contracts. It compares the legal principles concerning choice of law adopted by way of European harmonization with those currently utilized in the United Arab Emirates. The purpose of this comparison is to find points which are not addressed in the United Arab Emirates law under its Civil <b>Transactions</b> <b>Code,</b> or on which its provisions are unsatisfactory. In particular, the absence of any special provisions on choice of law for contracts such as consumer, insurance, and employment contracts which involved disparity of bargaining power between the parties, is considered. The thesis proposes new provisions which could usefully be adopted in the UAE by way of amendment to its Civil <b>Transactions</b> <b>Code</b> {{in the light of the}} European solutions under the Rome I Regulation. Attention is also given to a recently established territorial enclave, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), which has its own legal system, based on an English model, and is designed to attract international businesses and investors. Thus the thesis examines choice of law under DIFC law, and (in view of the rapid development of the DIFC legal order, and the numerous issues therein which have not yet been fully resolved) also considers other areas of {{private international law}} in the DIFC (such as judicial jurisdiction, arbitration and the enforcements of judgments and awards) ...|$|R

A new multi-axial approach ICD- 10 -PCS increased size 18 -fold from its prior version. New ICD- 10 -CM and PCS reflect a corresponding improvement in specificity and content. The forthcoming required national switch to these new administrative codes, coupled with nearly simultaneous widespread introduction of clinical systems and terminologies, requires substantial changes in US administrative systems.

The result is long outages and the “de-commit ” of many valid transactions, which must then be re-submitted, frequently manually. We have implemented in our transaction-time database system a technique in which only data tainted by a flawed transaction and transactions dependent upon its updates are “removed”. This process identifies and quarantines tainted data despite the complication of determining transactions dependent on data written by the flawed transaction. A further property of our implementation is that no backup needs to be installed for this because the prior transaction-time states provide an online backup...|$|R
