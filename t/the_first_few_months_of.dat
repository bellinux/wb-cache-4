5|$|Carl Hans Lody, alias Charles A. Inglis (20 January 1877 – 6 November 1914; name {{occasionally}} {{given as}} Karl Hans Lody), was a reserve {{officer of the}} Imperial German Navy who spied in the United Kingdom in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the First English Civil War {{although}} Worcester {{changed hands}} three times, only one musket shot was fired, so until {{the start of}} the short unsuccessful siege of May 1643 the medieval walls were not subjected to bombardment by an early modern artillery train.|$|E

5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Ridership {{initially}} {{fell short}} of forecasts, but grew from fewer than 40,000 passengers per day in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> operation to over 129,000 passengers per day in June 2013. Daily passenger traffic reached 130,000 in 2014, well below the forecast of 240,000 daily passengers for 2008. The system carried its first 100 million passengers by August 2010 and over 200 million passengers had taken the system by December 2012., followed by 400 million by December 2016.|$|E

5|$|Robson met Elsie Gray on a {{trip back}} to his parents' home in Langley Park. She was a student nurse, and later a teacher. They were married in June 1955 and Fulham {{teammate}} Tom Wilson was Robson's best man. After 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from cancer. He had several operations and, in 2006, was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma, which resulted in his missing <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the 1995–96 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> {{development was}} for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with a pad rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative aiming system that is activated upon pressing the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E
5|$|Throughout <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the 2009 {{season the}} Mets and Phillies {{looked as though}} they would make this year into another close playoff race. By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other; however, the Phillies {{retained}} a half game lead. Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries. By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead, but only to {{two and a half}} games.|$|E

5|$|After an {{educational}} trip to Rome, undertaken in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1859, {{he spent the}} summer of that year studying at the University of Edinburgh under, among others, the chemist Lyon Playfair. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying {{for the first time}} and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored in history by Charles Kingsley, Regius Professor of Modern History. Kingsley's efforts brought forth the best academic performances of Edward's life, and Edward actually looked forward to his lectures.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hero was an H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides {{as part of the}} Mediterranean Fleet. During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> World War II, Hero searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in May where she escorted a number of convoys to Malta. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940, Operation Abstention in February 1941, and the evacuations of Greece and Crete in April–May 1941.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hunter was a H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed on both sides by Britain and France, until she struck a mine in May 1937. She was under repair {{for the next year}} and a half, after which she rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet. During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> World War II, Hunter searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean until she was transferred back to Britain in February 1940. Returning to action in the Norwegian Campaign, she was sunk by German destroyers during the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940.|$|E
5|$|During Victoria's first {{pregnancy}} in 1840, in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford {{attempted to}} assassinate {{her while she}} was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert {{on her way to}} visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason, found not guilty on the grounds of insanity, and committed to an insane asylum indefinitely. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1967, the Viet Cong absorbed {{heavy losses}} {{as a result}} of {{large-scale}} search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army, and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam. In light of the setbacks which North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces had experienced early in 1967, North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units, hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam. Thus, towards mid-1967, the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again, with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone. On June 12, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division launched Operation Billings to destroy elements of the Viet Cong 9th Division, which had built-up strength around northern Phuoc Vinh.|$|E

The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940, the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and the evacuation of Greece in April 1941. She was damaged during the Battle of Crete the following month, but participated in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign in June.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hyperion was an H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides {{as part of the}} Mediterranean Fleet. During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> World War II, Hyperion searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and blockaded German merchant ships in neutral harbours until she returned to the British Isles in early 1940. The ship participated in the Norwegian Campaign before she was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterwards. Hyperion participated in the Battle of Calabria and the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940 while escorting the larger ships of the fleet. The ship covered several convoys to Malta before she struck a mine and was deliberately scuttled in December 1940.|$|E
5|$|Steve Burke {{served as}} the audio lead on the Kameo project, his first at Rare, for which he {{composed}} its soundtrack and contributed to its sound effects and voiceovers. As the game was originally planned for the GameCube, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> development appeared to have no support for audio above the MIDI sample-style compositions characteristic of Nintendo's previous console, the Nintendo 64. The game's first demo at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo used this type of audio. Of the first pieces he wrote for this project {{in the early months}} of 2001, some were scrapped. Others were re-recorded as streaming audio, which plays pre-recorded audio files, when the developers added support. It became Rare's first orchestral soundtrack. Other Rare staff members contributed their talents to the recording process, such as trumpet and voice recordings.|$|E
