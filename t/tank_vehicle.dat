40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new {{approach}} to investigating sloshing forces and moments caused by liquid sloshing within partially filled <b>tank</b> <b>vehicles</b> subjected to lateral excitations. An equivalent mechanical model is used in the paper to approximately simulate liquid sloshing. The mechanical model is derived by calculating the trajectory of the center of gravity of the liquid bulk in <b>tanks</b> as the <b>vehicle’s</b> lateral acceleration changes from 0 to 1 [*]g. Parametric expressions for the model are obtained by matching the dynamic effect of the mechanical model to that of liquid sloshing. And parameter values of a liquid sloshing dynamic effect, such as sloshing frequency and forces, are acquired using FLUENT to simulate liquid sloshing in tanks with different cross-sections and liquid fill percentages. The equivalent mechanical model for liquid sloshing in <b>tank</b> <b>vehicles</b> is of a great significance for simplifying the research on roll stability of <b>tank</b> <b>vehicles</b> and for developing active/passive roll control systems for these vehicles...|$|R
50|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} strongly {{influences the}} directional dynamics and safety performance of highway <b>tank</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{in a highly}} adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of partially-filled <b>tank</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Anti-slosh devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the <b>tank</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils; therefore stability of partially-filled liquid cargo vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.|$|R

50|$|Sophia the 3rd, the <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle</b> from Blaster Master, {{was added}} in the version 1.2 release.

5000|$|A heavy Panzerjager {{was ordered}} to be built by the Waffenamt (the German Government's Weapons {{building}} agency) in 1941. The vehicle was originally intended to be an anti <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and was developed as such, but part way through development it was realised that with the anti aircraft usefulness of the 88mm, {{it could also be}} a anti aircraft vehicle. In late 1942, there were 3 prototypes made. In 1944 It was built by Krupp[...] Various guns were considered.|$|E

5000|$|In Batman: Arkham Knight (2015), Scarecrow {{threatens the}} city with his newly created strain of fear toxin and bombs planted {{throughout}} Gotham, forcing the evacuation of the city's six million civilians. Towards {{the end of the}} game, Scarecrow disperses the fear toxin throughout Gotham with a <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle</b> called Cloudburst. The toxin forces people to experience illusions of their worst fears as though it was real. This leads to mass murders, suicides and a complete breakdown of the city.|$|E

Players control Jason {{behind the wheel of a}} <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle</b> called SOPHIA, exploring large environments and defeating various mutant enemies. Jason can also exit the tank to explore various areas into which the tank cannot venture. In addition to redone graphics and sound, Blaster Master Zero also adds various tweaks and features not seen in the NES game.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} game modes {{in the game}} and four maps available initially. Two modes focus on combat with light discs and two other modes feature vehicular combat on light cycles, as well as a special light <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Up to 10 people can play in online matches. Disintegration and team disintegration are classic deathmatch modes. Power Monger is a node control mode and Bit Runner is a capture-the-flag variation. There is also a levelling system, which upgrades your character version (level) and gains you more memory for upgrades. Your character can gain versions up to 50. When you are version 50 you cannot upgrade your character anymore.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} the largest tank built until that date. It had a length of 8.35 m (27.4 ft), a width of 2.842 m (9.32 ft), a hull height of 1.98 m (6.5 ft), a turret roof height of 2.785 m (9.14 ft) and a total height, cupola included, of 3 m (9.84 ft). It {{was also the first}} <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle</b> that offered a real {{protection}} against artillery HE rounds: the front hull was covered by 35 mm (1.38 in) armour plate; the same was the all-around thickness of the turret. The sides and rear were protected by 21 mm (0.83 in) plate, the top and roof by 15 mm (0.6 in). The total weight of the tank was 41.4 tonnes. Its empty hulk weight was 22.1 tonnes, 17.5 tonnes accounted for by the hull, of which 5.5 tonnes of armour, and 4.6 tonnes by the turret, including 1.3 tonnes of armour.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{addresses}} optimal {{technology and}} method for extrication and subsequent towing of crashed tank trucks. Ignorance of vehicle construction and wrongly chosen technology leads to subsequent after crash damages. Professional approach leads {{not only to}} after crash damages minimization on the vehicle, road and the surroundings, but also to convoy minimization etc. Another covered topic is <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle</b> construction (semi-trailer, trailer) because knowledge of tank construction and knowledge of transported material enable quick and safe extrication. Correct extrication method (which is also described in the thesis) can be used thanks to knowledge of crashed tank construction. Not knowing all needed information leads to after crash damages. This thesis will focus mainly on how to prevent subsequent damages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{instability}} of the direction dynamics of <b>tank</b> <b>vehicle</b> system under braking maneuver, the longitudinal equivalent model of liquid was formulated with consideration of both the steady-state and the transient state dynamics of the liquid. The Matlab/simulink program of the liquid was built and was combined with the vehicle model in Trucksim software to simulate and analyze {{the motion of the}} liquid cargo centroid and its dynamical effects on the vehicle under braking maneuver. It is observed that the liquid cargo slosh motion in tank vehicles has significant influences on braking performance, pitch motion and perpendicular motion of the vehicle. The results of this paper have significant help for studies on dynamics of vehicle tankers under braking maneuver and ensurement of braking stability and security...|$|E
