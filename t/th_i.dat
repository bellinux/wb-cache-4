40|$|The broad-host range plasmid pAW 63 is a {{model for}} the study of {{molecular}} mechanisms associated with conjugation in the Gram-positive Bacillus cereus group. Its main features are a conjugative apparatus that includes Type IV Secretion System-like components and two Group II introns, B. <b>th.</b> <b>I</b> 1 and B. <b>th.</b> <b>I</b> 2, located within conjugation genes, as well as a putative regulatory control circuit. Furthermore, pAW 63 shares a common backbone with pXO 2, the second virulence plasmid of Bacillus anthracis, and with pBT 9727 from the pathogenic Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. konkukian strain 97 - 27. In this study, the transcriptome of pAW 63 was investigated using a custom DNA microarray, providing insight into the genetic clockwork of this conjugative plasmid. Gene expression profiles suggested that in the absence of mating partners, a partial 'standby mode' was in effect, with little production of many of the structural elements thought to be involved in mating pair formation and DNA transfer, while components of a proposed quorum sensing mechanism were actively expressed. Intron splicing was demonstrated for the B. <b>th.</b> <b>I</b> 2 intron...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the combination of the T helper cell i (Thi) -derived cytokines interleukin (IL) - 2 and interferon (IFN) -y induces nitric oxide (NO) production and tumor cytolysis by mouse peritoneal macrophages and the mouse macrophage cell line ANA-i in vitro. Conversely, the Th 2 -derived cytokine IL- 4 inhibits IL- 2 and IFN- ’induced NO production and tumor cytolysis by ANA-i macrophages. To examine the paracrine regulatory effects of Thi and Th 2 cells on macrophages, various mouse T cell clones were tested for their ability to regulate NO production by mouse peritoneal macrophages or ANA-i macrophages. Antigen, superantigen, and mitogen stimulated Thi cells but not Th 2 cells induced NO production by macrophages. Supernatants from these activated <b>Th</b> <b>i</b> clones also induced NO production by peritoneal macrophages and ANA-i macrophages. Neutralization analysis using monoclonal anticytokine antibodies revealed that both IL- 2 and IFN-y production by activated <b>Th</b> <b>i</b> cells were required for the production of NO by macrophages. Co-culture studies using a panel of Th 2 cell clones that share the same antigen specificity revealed that these cells suppressed Thi-mediated macrophage activation. The Th 2 -mediated impairment of Thi-induced NO production was primarily due to the secretion of 11 - 4. IL-’! appeared to have a direct effect on macrophage activation because neither mitogen-induced proliferation of <b>Th</b> <b>i</b> cells nor cytokine production by Thi cells were affected by IL-’!. Overall, these results suggest that a potent paracrine regulatory network involving <b>Th</b> <b>i</b> cells and Th 2 cells may control the activation of macrophages for NO production and antitumo...|$|E
