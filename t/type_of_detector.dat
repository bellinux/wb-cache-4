25|$|Sulfur sticks are burnt {{to detect}} small leaks in {{industrial}} ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities {{can be detected}} by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with quicklime, when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent. Ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration; the permissible exposure limit is 25ppm, and lethal above 500ppm. Higher concentrations are hardly detected by conventional detectors, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> is chosen according to the sensitivity required (e.g. semiconductor, catalytic, electrochemical). Holographic sensors have been proposed for detecting concentrations up to 12.5% in volume.|$|E
25|$|Commercial smoke {{detectors}} are either conventional or addressable, and {{are connected to}} security alarm or fire alarm systems controlled by fire alarm control panels (FACP). These {{are the most common}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector,</b> and are usually significantly more expensive than single-station battery-operated residential smoke alarms. They are used in most commercial and industrial facilities and other places such as ships and trains, but are also part of some security alarm systems in homes. These detectors don't need to have built in alarms, as alarm systems can be controlled by the connected FACP, which will set off relevant alarms, and can also implement complex functions such as a staged evacuation.|$|E

500|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} {{can be used}} to extract individual components from a mixture dissolved in a solution. [...] HPLC is used for nonvolatile mixtures that would not be suitable for gas chromatography. [...] This is useful in drug analysis where the pharmaceutical is a combination drug since the components would separate, or elute, at different times allowing for the verification of each component. [...] The eluates from the HPLC column are then fed into various detectors that produce a peak on a graph relative to its concentration as it elutes off the column. [...] The most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> is an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer as the most common item of interest tested with HPLC, pharmaceuticals, have UV absorbance.|$|E

50|$|An {{infrared}} detector is a detector that reacts to infrared (IR) radiation. The two main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectors</b> are thermal and photonic (photodetectors).|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} more <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectors</b> at the HEGRA site: the CRT (Cosmic Ray Tracking)http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/CRT/CRT.html and the CLUE (Cherenkov Light Ultraviolet Experiment)http://www.pi.infn.it/clue/.|$|R
50|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> {{was used}} {{in a series of}} thermal imagers known as TICM (thermal imaging common modules). These modules were the {{mainstay}} of UK forces thermal imagers from the 1980s until their replacement by fully staring, two-dimensional-arrays detectors.|$|E
50|$|For this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector,</b> a {{comparator}} detects {{each time}} an ac pulse changes polarity. The {{output of the}} comparator changes state each time the pulse changes its polarity, that is the output is HI (high) for a positive pulse and LO (low) for a negative pulse squares the input signal.|$|E
50|$|For example, if {{you were}} to {{separate}} two different proteins with different binding capacities to the column from a solution sample, a good <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> would be a spectrophotometer using a wavelength of 280 nm. The higher the concentration of protein that passes through the eluted solution through the column, the higher the absorbance of that wavelength.|$|E

40|$|For the {{running-in}} and {{the operation}} of a large accelerator like the SPS, the beam instrumentation plays a prominent part. Though limiting the beam detectors to where they are strictly necessary, their number is still considerable, leading to {{a large amount of}} data to be treated simultaneously. To do this efficiently, hardware and software are equally important. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectors</b> is determined by their function, intensity, position, profile, loss, etc [...] . whereas the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> associated electronics and acquisition systems is restricted to a minimum for simplicity, production cost, easy maintenance and fast data treatment. The performance <b>of</b> the main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectors</b> is summarised giving some particularities of their hardware and software with some emphasis on the closed orbit measurement and correction system. (6 refs) ...|$|R
5000|$|A third <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> is the gas {{ionization}} detector. The gas ionization detectors {{have some}} advantages over silicon detectors, for example, {{they are completely}} impervious to beam damage, since the gas can be replenished continuously. Nuclear experiments with large area ionization chambers increase the particle and position resolution {{have been used for}} many years and can easily be assimilated to any specific geometry. The limiting factor on energy resolution using this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> is the entrance window, which needs to be strong enough to withstand the atmospheric pressure of the gas, 20-90 mbar. Ultra-thin silicon nitride windows have been introduced, together with dramatic simplifications in the design, which have been demonstrated to be nearly as good as more complex designs for low energy ERD. These detectors have also been implemented in heavy ion Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. Figure 7 shows the Gas Ionization chamber with Isobutane as the detector gas.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{ion beam}} has ionized target sample atoms, the sample ions are recoiled toward the detector. The beam ions are {{scattered}} {{at an angle}} that does not permit them to reach the detector. The sample ions pass through an entrance window of the detector, and depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> used, the signal is converted into a spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Ashra (All-sky Survey High Resolution Air-shower detector) - The {{group has}} {{developed}} a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> with wide angle high resolution aiming for monitoring optical and particle radiation from high-energy transient objects. Prototypes were installed {{on the slopes of}} the Mauna Loa volcano at about 10,500 feet elevation in 2006 and 2007. Mauna Loa is located in the Big Island in the U.S. state of Hawaii.|$|E
40|$|This {{introductory}} review deals {{particularly with}} experimental techniques used in searches for gravitational radiation, and prospects for developing gravitational wave <b>detectors</b> <b>of</b> very much higher sensitivity.

50|$|Adaptions of {{this basic}} design are the thin gap, {{resistive}} plate and drift chambers.

25|$|Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> phase <b>detectors</b> have {{different}} performance characteristics.|$|R
50|$|This device emits {{microwaves}} from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves or {{reduction in}} beam intensity using a receiver. The {{transmitter and receiver}} are usually combined inside a single housing (monostatic) for indoor applications, and separate housings (bistatic) for outdoor applications. To reduce false alarms this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> is usually combined with a passive infrared detector, or Dual Tec brand or similar alarm.|$|E

50|$|In {{elastic recoil}} {{detection}} analysis, a silicon diode {{is the most}} common detector. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> is commonly used, however, there are some major disadvantages when using this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector.</b> For example, the energy resolution decreases significantly with a Si detector when detecting heavy recoiled ions. There is also a possibility of damage to the detector by radiation exposure. These detectors have a short functional lifetime (5-10 years) when doing heavy ion analysis. One of the main advantages of silicon detectors is their simplicity. However, they have to be used with a so-called “range foil” to range out the forward scattered heavy beam ions. Therefore, the simple range foil ERD has two major disadvantages: first, the loss of energy resolution due to the energy straggle and second, thickness inhomogeneity of the range foil, and the intrinsic indistinguishability of the signals for the various different recoiled target elements. Aside from the listed disadvantages, ERDA range foils with silicon detectors is still a powerful method and is relatively simple to work with.|$|E

5000|$|This was a {{significant}} development as existing commercial wireless systems were heavily protected by patents; a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> would allow De Forest to market his own system. He eventually discovered that connecting the antenna circuit to a third electrode placed directly in the current path greatly improved the sensitivity; in his earliest versions, this was simply a piece of wire bent {{into the shape of}} a grid-iron (hence [...] "grid").|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} involved Jain's use of 3-dimensional {{photographic medium}} targets in heavy-ion particle accelerators; modern detectors using electronic sensors {{were unable to}} detect the axion due to the very short distances and times involved, but the physical medium was able to identify about 1,200 Axion traces over years of experiment. Jain {{is one of the}} few currently working physicists with experience with that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector,</b> which had been largely abandoned in favor of the modern electronic detectors.|$|E
5000|$|Demodulation: After {{the radio}} signal is {{filtered}} and amplified, the receiver must extract the information-bearing modulation {{signal from the}} modulated radio frequency carrier wave. This is done by a circuit called a demodulator (detector). Each type of modulation uses a matching <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>detector</b> for optimum results; FM, for example, works poorly with an AM detector. Many other types of modulation are also used for specialized purposes. These different types of modulation require different demodulation circuits.|$|E
