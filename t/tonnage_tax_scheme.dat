40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study and {{evaluate}} the Norwegian <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system {{and its impact on}} Wilhelmsen Group. Background/Problem: The maritime sector has always been highly affected by financial and political shocks. So when Norway introduced their new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system, it came as a great shock for shipping companies located in Norway. They now had to decide whether to enter the new system or not. Method: To solve the purpose, Wilhelmsen's annual reports has been scruti-nised in order to create an overview look of the impacts of the new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system. In addition, useful information has come from several journals and seminars attended at BI 2008. Conclusion: The findings of this thesis argues that the New Norwegian <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system is in its core state, where many changes are still being made. However what has been established is that the new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system is profitable, and that Wilhelmsen group wants to apply for this new system, shows its successfulness...|$|R

40|$|The tax {{treatment}} of the shipping industry over the last 30 years exhibits alternative forms of corporate taxation systems implemented by various governments. A consensus view {{of the way in}} which shipping should be treated for tax purposes has resulted in the widely adopted form of the <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax.</b> The aim of the paper is to examine the success or otherwise of such shipping fiscal policies in respect of widely accepted perspectives and set objectives. The focus of the study is on the UK registry, investigating the impact of the introduction of the UK <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax.</b> Noteworthy results emerge along with the understanding that, in the long run, the <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> seems to be connected more with the 'flagging out' of foreign owned tonnage than with the 'flagging in' of nationally owned vessels. The findings can be considered to have broader implications for the competitiveness of national ship registries and for policy making...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{merchant}} fleet has declined sharply since the 1970 s, {{largely because of}} the lack of competitive conditions compared with many other countries, for instance Denmark. A large number of ships flagged out from Sweden, some shipping companies have even closed down offices and moved abroad which meant jobs being lost as a result. To prevent ships from flagging out, Sweden introduced various support measures such as subsidies for shipping and TAP agreements, which would reduce the crew costs for Swedish flagged vessels. These measures have not completely slowed down the flagging out, as it has continued to do so in recent years. Other European countries, such as Denmark and Norway, chose to adopt more parts of the Commission's State Aid Guidelines, for instance the international ship register and <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax,</b> which has increased their competitiveness against Sweden. To prevent further vessels from flagging out and promote regrowth in Swedish shipping, Sweden has decided to introduce <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> in the summer of 2016, which has made the shipping industry very happy. The report was written in 2016 to find out what the Swedish shipping companies require to flag into Sweden, and if the <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> will affect shipping companies to register their ships in Sweden. To find out, six shipping companies were interviewed, as well as the industry organization Swedish Shipowner’s Association and one of the unions. Overall the shipping companies are satisfied with some of the actions that has been adopted, including <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> and the delegation of flag state inspections from the Transport Agency to classification societies. However, they demand long-term and reliable maritime transport politics, as well as that the Swedish Transport Agency should continue to improve, for example, their customer service and the procedure of flagging into Sweden. Furthermore, some of the companies want to see that the Maritime Officers' Association provides temporary or permanent exception from the requirements to have a Swedish master and chief engineer. In the Swedish Government Official Reports, SOU 2010 : 73, parts of the proposed actions have been implemented. The net wage model has been increased and the Swedish Transport Agency has appointed a supervisor to handle the matters regarding the registration of ships.

40|$|The Ministry of Finance {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Etlatieto Ltd on maritime operating conditions, competitiveness and the adaptability of this sector. The competitiveness of cargo ship has significantly improved when mixed-nationality crews were allowed and the <b>Tonnage</b> <b>Tax</b> Act went into force. The use of non-EU seamen reduces the labour costs of a ship by 20 to 30 %. The <b>Tonnage</b> <b>Tax</b> Act cuts the taxation of cargo vessels from 10 - 30 million euros to half a million euros. The mixed-nationality crew agreement {{does not apply to}} passenger ships. It is not worthwhile for them to shift to being <b>taxed</b> under the <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax,</b> because their store sales would be subject to special taxes, which would cut profitability significantly. In 2015, 0. 1 % sulphur limits for maritime transport will go into effect. In new ships, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions must be limited. In addition, bilge water and waste disposal regulations will become stricter. These will result in significant pressure on investments. The EU is considering removing the VAT-free sales status of the internal transport, which would lower sales of passenger ships by 55 million euros and profit margins by 25 million euros. If the prevalence of mixed-nationality crews grows at current rates, this would lower shipping subsidies - in 2015 the savings would amount to over 10 million euros. Savings would also come from the rationalization of fragmented training, which would allow raising the level of training. Maritime rescue and VTS centres' control functions could be combined in Helsinki and Turku. The government should concentrate ice breaking operations on safeguarding the transport of foreign trade and give up offshore business activities. The sale of offshore businesses and multipurpose icebreakers would finance new investments in the ice-breaking fleet without any additional debt and its interest expenses...|$|R

Second, minimum wages - and wage and labour controls more generally - can enhance redistributive efficiency.

40|$|Abstract: In {{conducting}} economic policy, governments generally face {{conflicts in}} various objectives, e. g. between efficiency and equity. In Norway, one objective of energy politics {{has been to}} reduce electricity consumption, and several tax increases have been proposed. Whether this objective may be in conflict with objectives of efficiency and equity is the focus in this paper. We discuss the effects on household behaviour of three different electricity <b>tax</b> <b>schemes,</b> one proportional and two non-linear. For each household we estimate the reduction in household electricity consumption. As measures of distributional effects and efficiency effects we estimate compensating variation and excess tax burden from the <b>tax</b> <b>schemes.</b> We find that the non-linear <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> targeting high electricity consumption is most preferred {{in order to reduce}} consumption and least preferred concerning the objective of minimizing excess tax burden. When considering distributional effects, the ranking of <b>tax</b> <b>schemes</b> depends on the weight placed on different household groups.
