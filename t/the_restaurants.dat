5|$|NSS derived most of {{its revenue}} from the {{operation}} of restaurants at railway stations; in 1939, this amounted to 80%. Initially, the company operated the restaurant at Oslo Ø; from 1921, it also took over operation of <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> at Oslo West Station, Hamar, Koppang, Opdal and Elverum. The following year, four more restaurants were added: Støren, Myrdal, Dokka and Hell. NSS also established its first kiosk, at Bergen Station. In 1923, the company was allowed to take over all restaurants in the railway districts of Oslo and Hamar; by 1925, it had taken over operation of <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> at Lillehammer, Hønefoss, Jessheim, Kornsjø, Halden, Ski, Eidsvoll, Otta, Dombås, Åndalsnes, Kongsvinger, Trondheim, Rena, Roa, Ringebu, Bjorli and Finse.|$|E
5|$|Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau (whose {{first and}} last names are anagrams of each other). Many reviewers believe that Gusteau is {{inspired}} by real-life chef Bernard Loiseau, who committed suicide after media speculation that his flagship restaurant, La Côte d'Or, {{was going to be}} downgraded from three Michelin stars to two. LaCôte d'Or was one of <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> visited by Brad Bird and others in France.|$|E

5|$|The 7.5-acre parcel was rezoned in 2010 {{for senior}} housing that was {{expected}} to provide a new customer base for <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> and retailers already {{in the area and}} for commercial developments still to come. The lot had sat unused for about ten years before construction on the 215-unit complex began; Azulón at Mesa Verde opened in 2014. Several dozen palm and eucalyptus trees were saved and replanted on the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} had 37 {{locations in}} 2002, 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises. <b>The</b> <b>restaurants</b> were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, {{a greater emphasis}} on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.|$|E

50|$|Zafferano {{was opened}} by chef Giorgio Locatelli in February 1995 in Knightsbridge, London. <b>The</b> <b>restaurant's</b> {{name comes from}} the Italian for saffron. The {{location}} had previously been a fish restaurant, but under Locatelli <b>the</b> new <b>restaurant</b> served Italian food. The major investor in <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> was Claudio Pulze, who owned <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> through his company A-Z Restaurants.

Other commercial properties inside the stadium complex are two clothing stores and kiosks whose operators {{have not yet been}} decided upon.|$|E
5|$|After this NSS {{decided not}} to obtain many {{additional}} restaurants, as it did not see value in such a strategy. From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at Ål, Jaren, Lillestrøm and Tønsberg, along with dining service on the steamship Skibladner, which ran on Mjøsa. During {{the first half of}} the 1940s it again acquired new restaurants, including the one at Kristiansand Station. In 1940 and 1941 the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss. During the late 1940s NSS also took over <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> at Drammen and Sarpsborg, as well as the one at Oslo Airport, Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|Massey and Brown {{introduced}} standardization to the fragmented company. After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model across the entire chain. Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items {{so that they could}} concentrate on KFC products. <b>The</b> <b>restaurants</b> were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees.|$|E

5|$|Two former {{restaurants}} operated at the campus: the Conservatory Restaurant was led {{by students}} of the Farm-to-Table concentration in the CIA's bachelor's degree programs. The Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant (WSGR) was run by students in the associate degree program in culinary arts. The restaurant focused on using local and seasonal ingredients, and the dining room had open cooking stations to give diners a {{full view of the}} working kitchen. The WSGR initially served food of the Mediterranean cuisines, and was at first professionally run. Later on, it became fully student-run, however changes in late 2015 led to lunch service staffed by students and dinner service staffed by employees. <b>The</b> <b>restaurants</b> closed around 2016 with the campus' reorganization after purchasing Copia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its {{clientele}} diminished, {{and for the first}} time in its existence it began to lose money. It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former chef of the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation; this was achieved by annexing two town houses, joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten-year renovation cost a total of $250million. <b>The</b> <b>restaurants</b> were given a new look, and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier.|$|E
5|$|Founder Steve Ells {{attended}} the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, {{he became a}} line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco. There, Ells observed {{the popularity of the}} taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue, near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father. Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day. The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company. Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> saw success.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2013, Burger Lounge {{opened a}} second location, in North County, part of San Diego, California.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>restaurant</b> {{finds it}} origin in a trout farm, {{built by the}} Nederlandsche Heidemaatschappij around 1898. Later, the farm was opened for {{visitors}}. The visitors could enjoy fresh trout in <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> beside <b>the</b> fish pool. In January 1967, <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> is first mentioned as being named Truite d'Or. In <b>the</b> beginning <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> was solely focused on trout, but after the take over by Martin Snellen, the card was widened. In 1976, <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> was renovated into a more French style. In 1977, head chef Theo Kurvers left and owner Martin Snellen decided to appoint Maître d'hôtel (and replacement chef) Karel Swart as the new head chef. In 1982, Snellen sold <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> but <b>the</b> new owners could not save <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> and it closed in 1985.|$|R
5|$|The {{regional}} licensing model {{remained in}} place until 1978 when the company hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements, disallowing new owners from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, preventing corporations from owning franchises and prohibiting franchisees from operating other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. Smith also altered the way the company dealt with new properties by making the company the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> to its franchises. This policy would allow the company {{to take over the}} operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. However, by 1988 Burger King parent Pillsbury had relaxed many of Smith's changes, scaled back on construction of new locations and stalling growth. When Pillsbury was acquired in 1989 by Grand Metropolitan, the company fell further into decline, a pattern which continued under Grand Met successor Diageo. This institutionalized neglect further hurt the standing of the brand, in turn causing significant financial damage to Burger King's franchises.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of restaurants, mainly in Covent Garden's central area around the piazza, and in the St Martin's Lane area {{bordering}} the West End; some of these with international reputations. Among <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> are the historic theatrical eating places, the oldest of which is Rules, which was founded in 1798, making it the oldest restaurant in London, followed by J. Sheekey, an oyster bar and fish restaurant founded in 1893 by market-stall holder Josef Sheekey in Lord Salisbury's St Martin's Court, and The Ivy, which was founded as an unlicensed Italian cafe by Abel Giandellini in 1917. Other restaurants include Belgo Centraal on Earlham Street, part of the Belgo chain of Belgian themed restaurants; one of Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurants, which opened in 2007; Gaby's Deli, a Jewish cafe and restaurant serving falafels and salt beef sandwiches since 1965, and Mon Plaisir, founded in 1943, one of the oldest French restaurants in London. Covent Garden was home to some of London's earliest coffee shops, such as Old Slaughter's Coffee House, which ran from 1692 until 1843, and a Beefsteak Club, the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks, which was co-founded in 1736 by William Hogarth at the Theatre Royal (now the Royal Opera House).|$|E

50|$|Norsk Spisevognselskap {{operated}} <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> from 15 June to 1 October 1925, {{after which}} operation was reverted {{to the station}} master.

50|$|The {{selection}} of a restaurant POS system is critical to <b>the</b> <b>restaurant's</b> daily operation and is a major investment that <b>the</b> <b>restaurant's</b> management and staff must live with for many years. <b>The</b> <b>restaurant</b> POS system interfaces with all phases of <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> operation and with everyone that is involved with <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> including guests, suppliers, employees, managers and owners. The {{selection of}} a restaurant POS system is a complex process that should be undertaken by <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> owner and not delegated to an employee. The purchase process can be summarized into three steps: Design, Compare and Negotiate. The Design step requires research to determine which restaurant POS features are needed for <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> operation. With this information <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> owner or manager can Compare various restaurant POS solutions to determine which POS systems meet their requirements. The final step is to Negotiate the price, payment terms, included training, initial warranty and ongoing support costs.|$|R
