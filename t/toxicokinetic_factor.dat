40|$|Children's {{responses}} to environmental toxicants {{will be affected}} by the way in which their systems absorb, distribute, metabolize, and excrete chemicals. These <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>factors</b> vary during development, from in utero where maternal and placental processes play a large role, to the neonate in which emerging metabolism and clearance pathways are key determinants. Toxicokinetic differences between neonates and adults lead to the potential for internal dosimetry differences and increased or decreased risk, depending on the mechanisms for toxicity and clearance of a given chemical. This article raises a number of questions {{that need to be addressed}} when conducting a toxicokinetic analysis of in utero or childhood exposures. These questions are organized into a proposed framework for conducting the assessment that involves problem formulation (identification of early life stage <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>factors</b> and chemical-specific factors that may raise questions/concerns for children); data analysis (development of analytic approach, construction of child/adult or child/animal dosimetry comparisons); and risk characterization (evaluation of how children's toxicokinetic analysis can be used to decrease uncertainties in the risk assessment). The proposed approach provides a range of analytical options, from qualitative to quantitative, for assessing children's dosimetry. Further, it provides background information on a variety of <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>factors</b> that can vary as a function of developmental stage. For example, the ontology of metabolizing systems is described via reference to pediatric studies involving therapeutic drugs and evidence from in vitro enzyme studies. This type of resource information is intended to help the assessor begin to address the issues raised in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Sheep flocks are {{sensitive}} to the top soil intake, via their grazing activity and the ingestion of soil particles incorporated into the hay especially during harvesting operations. Such intake is estimated between 2 and 20 % of the dry matter from grass and hay and may vary accounting for seasonal and geographical differences in the quality of pastures. The persistent organic pollutants accumulated in soil such as polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs), may transfer through the food chain. In this paper, the authors consider the quality of soils and the <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>factors</b> that allow the transfer of the contamination to milk and the edible tissues in sheep. The wide range of PCDD/F concentration reported in milk (0. 05 - 30 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ/g fat), meat (0. 18 - 4. 9 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ/g fat) and liver (4. 8 - 161 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ/g fat) from extensively reared flocks in areas of European countries under different industrial and urban pressures, indicate the opportunity to adopt risk management options based on environmental quality standards and good agriculture practices, able to support the access to a safe and nutritious food. With respect to the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake, liver represents the most contaminated food item, for its ability to bind such lipophilic contaminants irrespective of its lipid content. Case-studies from the Mediterranean area are illustrated, to support the environment and health approach also in terms of sustainability of family farms production...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{explored}} {{the applicability of}} using in vitro micronucleus (MN) data from human lymphoblastoid TK 6 cells to derive in vivo genotoxicity potency information. Nineteen chemicals covering {{a broad spectrum of}} genotoxic modes of action were tested in an in vitro MN test using TK 6 cells using the same study protocol. Several of these chemicals were considered to need metabolic activation, and these were administered in the presence of S 9. The Benchmark dose (BMD) approach was applied using the dose-response modeling program PROAST to estimate the genotoxic potency from the in vitro data. The resulting in vitro BMDs were compared with previously derived BMDs from in vivo MN and carcinogenicity studies. A proportional correlation was observed between the BMDs from the in vitro MN and the BMDs from the in vivo MN assays. Further, a clear correlation was found between the BMDs from in vitro MN and the associated BMDs for malignant tumors. Although these results are based on only 19 compounds, they show that genotoxicity potencies estimated from in vitro tests may result in useful information regarding in vivo genotoxic potency, as well as expected cancer potency. Extension of the number of compounds and further investigation of metabolic activation (S 9) and of other <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>factors</b> would be needed to validate our initial conclusions. However, this initial work suggests that this approach could be used for in vitro to in vivo extrapolations which would support the reduction of animals used in research (3 Rs: replacement, reduction, and refinement) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} local {{influence}} analysis to assigned model quantities {{in the context}} of a dose–response analysis of cancer mortality in relation to estimated absorbed dose of dioxin. The risk estimation is performed using dioxin dose as a time-dependent explanatory variable in a proportional hazard model. The dioxin dose is computed using a toxicokinetic model, which depends on some factors, such as assigned constants and estimated parameters. We present a local influence analysis to assess the effects on final results of minor perturbations of <b>toxicokinetic</b> model <b>factors.</b> In the present context, there is no evidence of local influence in risk estimates.

40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are associated}} with high prevalence of gastro-intestinal side-effects. In vivo studies suggest that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is an important cause of the toxicity and that the toxicity is aggravated by enterohepatic circulation. Precision-cut intestinal slices (PCIS) are a newly established in vitro model with intact architecture of the intestine, preserved viability and metabolism during incubation up to 24 h. In this study, this model is used to predict NSAID-induced intestinal toxicity. PCIS from rat jejunum were incubated for 5 h with a concentration range of 5 NSAIDs: diflunisal (0. 05 - 1 mM), indomethacin (0. 05 - 1 mM), diclofenac (0. 05 - 1 mM), naproxen (0. 1 - 5 mM) and aspirin (0. 1 - 10 mM). Toxicity was assessed by the ATP content. In vitro TC 50 of these 5 compounds was calculated and compared with in vivo TC 50 and the mitochondrial toxicity data {{as reported in the}} literature. Based on TC 50 values, toxicity ranking in the present study appeared to be: aspirin (> 10 mM) > naproxen (2. 96 mM) > diclofenac (0. 29 mM) > indomethacin (0. 29 mM) > diflunisal (0. 18 mM). This is very well in line with the reported toxicity ranking found with the isolated mitochondria. When compared with the in vivo TC 50, only one exception of diflunisal was found, which appeared highly toxic in vitro whereas in vivo it's one of the least toxic compound. This discrepancy could not yet be explained by in vivo <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>factors</b> (absorbtion, enterohepatic circulation, metabolism, excretion). In conclusion, both intrinsic (mitochondrial) toxicity as well as in vivo toxicity ranking are well predicted by the PCIS model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA multi-compartment physiologically based {{pharmacokinetic}} (PBPK) {{model was}} developed to describe the behavior of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in rats and mice following long-term oral exposure. Model compartments were included for GI lumen, oral mucosa, forestomach/stomach, small intestinal mucosa (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), blood, liver, kidney, bone, and a combined compartment for remaining tissues. Data from ex vivo Cr(VI) reduction studies were used to characterize reduction of Cr(VI) in fed rodent stomach fluid as a second-order, pH-dependent process. For model development, tissue time-course data for total chromium were collected from rats and mice exposed to Cr(VI) in drinking water for 90 days at six concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 180 mg Cr(VI) /L. These data were used to supplement the tissue time-course data collected in other studies with oral administration of Cr(III) and Cr(VI), including that from recent NTP chronic bioassays. Clear species differences were identified for chromium delivery to the target tissue (small intestines), with higher concentrations achieved in mice than in rats, consistent with small intestinal tumor formation, which was observed upon chronic exposures in mice but not in rats. Erythrocyte:plasma chromium ratios suggest that Cr(VI) entered portal circulation at drinking water concentrations equal to and greater than 60 mg/L in rodents. Species differences are described for distribution of chromium to the liver and kidney, with liver:kidney ratios higher in mice than in rats. Overall, the PBPK model provides a good description of chromium toxicokinetics, with model predictions for tissue chromium within a factor of 3 for greater than 80 % of measurements evaluated. The tissue data and PBPK model predictions indicate a concentration gradient in the small intestines (duodenum>jejunum>ileum), which will be useful for assessing the tumor response gradient observed in mouse small intestines in terms of target tissue dose. The rodent PBPK model presented here, when {{used in conjunction with}} a human PBPK model for Cr(VI), should provide a more robust characterization of species differences in <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>factors</b> for assessing the potential risks associated with low-dose exposures of Cr(VI) in human populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{acceptable}} {{daily intake}} (ADI) of commercially available steviol glycosides is currently 4 mg/kg body weight (bw) /day, based on application of a 100 -fold uncertainty factor to a no-observed-adverse-effect-level value from a chronic rat study. Within the 100 -fold uncertainty factor is a 10 -fold uncertainty factor to account for inter-species differences in toxicokinetics (4 -fold) and toxicodynamics (2. 5 -fold). Single dose pharmacokinetics of stevioside were studied in rats (40 and 1, 000 mg/kg bw) and in male human subjects (40 mg/kg bw) to generate a chemical-specific, inter-species <b>toxicokinetic</b> adjustment <b>factor.</b> Tmax values for steviol were at ~ 8 and ~ 20 hours after administration in rats and humans, respectively. Peak concentrations of steviol were similar in rats and humans, while steviol glucuronide concentrations were significantly higher in humans. Glucuronidation in rats was not saturated over the dose range 40 - 1, 000 mg/kg bw. The AUC 0 -last for steviol was approximately 2. 8 -fold greater in humans compared to rats. Chemical-specific adjustment factors for extrapolating toxicokinetics from rat to human of 1 and 2. 8 were established based on Cmax and AUC 0 -last data respectively. Because these factors are lower than the default value of 4. 0, a higher ADI for steviol glycosides of between 6 to 16 mg/kg bw/d is justified...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that some environmental chemicals can interrupt neurodevelopmental processes during critical periods of development, resulting in effects on sensory, motor, and cognitive function. It is now generally accepted that developing organisms are differentially sensitive to chemical exposure because of <b>toxicokinetic</b> and/or toxicodynamic <b>factors.</b> Regulatory mechanisms {{have been implemented}} to protect humans from over- or inappropriate exposures to environmental chemicals. Current regulatory practices, however, may be insufficient because {{of the possibility that}} some environmental chemicals interfere with endocrine function at key periods of neurodevelopment. In addition, a recent National Research Council (NRC) report on pesticide contamination in the diets of infants and children concluded that current regulatory practices may not sufficiently protect infants and children from the risk of pesticide exposure. The NRC report indicates that regulatory agencies might underestimate the actual exposure of infants and children to pesticides and rely too heavily on data from adults in the risk assessment of pesticides. Consideration of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the differential susceptibility of infants and children has led to identification of a number of information gaps and research needs that should be addressed in order to improve future risk assessments for these chemicals. - Environ Health Perspect 1 06 (Suppl 3) : 807 - 811 (1998) ...|$|R
40|$|For human risk {{assessments}} extrapolation of experimental {{data to the}} real human exposure situation is required. In this context the REACH guidance document has proposed default extrapolation factors for inter-species differences, {{as well as for}} differences in duration of exposure. Already several groups have analysed interspecies and time-extrapolation factors, but predominately based on limited datasets (Kalberlah et al., 2002; Vermeire et al., 2001; Pieters et al., 1998). The Fraunhofer Institute ITEM has developed the database RepDose on subacute to chronic toxicity studies in rodents. The high quality and amount of data in RepDose allows to reevaluate the current extrapolation factors for rats and mice and for time-extrapolation. A tiered approach is applied to evaluate both assessment factors distinguishing oral and inhalation exposure. Based on allometric considerations, for <b>toxicokinetic</b> properties a <b>factor</b> of 7 is proposed by the guidance to extrapolate doses as mg/kg bw from mice to humans and a factor of 4 for rats. Thus an extrapolation factor of 1. 75 would account for differences between rats and mice. Further according to the guidance a factor of 2. 5 is applied to account for toxicodynamic differences between species. The data in RepDose show, that on average the differences between both species are smaller than the standard extrapolation factor. Assessment factors for time-extrapolation are derived for subchronic to chronic, subacute to chronic and subacute to subchronic exposure. For the chemicals covered in RepDose, in general lower time-extrapolation factors are derived compared to those proposed by the REACH guidance document. The impact of local effects and certain physical-chemical properties like accumulation is described...|$|R
