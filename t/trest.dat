40|$|A {{series of}} <b>trests</b> with a 200 mm model {{propeller}} of the Canadian Coast Guard's R-Class icebreakers {{were conducted in}} the cavitation tunnel of the University of Tokyo's Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. The experiments were conducted {{to examine the effects}} of cavitation on the hydrodynamic loads associated with the operation of an ice class propeller in the wake of a near by ice piece. Tests were conducted with the propeller operating in the wake of the simulated blockage over a range of cavitation numbers and advance coefficients. The blockage was mounted on an instrumented load cell and measurements were made of block load as the propeller blades passed into and out of a recess milled in the block. Cavitation duting propeller ice inrteraction results in a reduction of mean suction load on the ice block. Block load measurements indicate an increase in the oscillation about the mean value of the loads, with a variation in the phase of the loading with respect to blade position as compared to atmospheric results.

40|$|In Zellkulturexperimenten wurden die Effekte von Simvastatin (Prodrug), Atorvastatin, Pravastatin und dem Proteasomhemmer Lactacystin suf zwei Endothelzelllinien (CPAE und Ea. hy 926) und primäre vaskuläre glatte Muskelzellen (VSMCs) bezüglich ihres Verhaltens auf die Morphologie, die Proliferation, die Viabilität und die Proteasomaktivität untersucht. Sowohl die Statine als auch Lactacystin induzierten vergleichbare morphologische Veränderungen und beeinflussten die Proliferation von CPAE-Zellen. In den eigenen Versuchen konnten durch Statine induzierte Effekte durch Mevalonat revertiert werden. Die durch Lactacystin verursachten Veränderungen wurden durch Mevalonsäure nicht beeinflusst. Wie erwartet hemmte Lactacystin in den untersuchten CPAE-Zellen signifikant die proteasomale Aktivität. Im Gegensatz dazu blieb die Proteasomaktivität nach einer Statinbehandlung unbeeinflusst. Ähnliche Ergebnisse wurden auch in den Ea. hy 926 und den VSMCs deutlich. Weiterhin konnte gezeigt werden, dass sogar hohe Dosen der Statine die Aktivität der gereinigten 20 S Proteasomen nicht modulieren. Aus diesen Ergebnissen lässt sich schlußfolgern, dass die ähnlichen biologischen Effekte der Statine und des Lactacystins nicht über einen gemeinsamen Mechanismus der Proteasominhibition funktionieren. The {{effect of}} simvastatin, atrovastatin and {{pravastatin}} {{as well as}} of the proteasom inhibitor beta-clasto lactacystin was studied on morphology, proliferation viability and on proteasomaö activityin two mammalian endothelial cell lines (CPAE and Ey. hy 926) and in primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Both statins and lactacystin induced comparable morphological changes and attenuated proliferation of CPAE. Whereas the statin-induced effects were reversed by mevalonic acid, however, the lactacystin-induced alterations were not influenced by mevalonic acid. As expected, lactacystin caused a significant loss of proteasomal activity measured in the extracts of <b>trested</b> cells. The extracts of statin-treated CPAEs exhibited unchanged activities. This result was also confirmed in Ea. hy 926 cells and in primary rat VSMCs. It is shown, that even high dosis of statins do not modulate the activity of purified human 20 S proteasomes. The conclusion was that similar biological effects of statins and the well known proteasome inhibitor lactacystin in vascular cells are not caused by a common inhibitory mechanism ofaction on the proteasome...|$|R
