After releasing their previous album Frigid Stars LP in 1990, the group accepted {{an invitation from}} the quartet Bastro to tour in Europe in 1991. Following the tour the group was invited <b>to</b> <b>record</b> a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted <b>to</b> <b>record</b> their follow-up album The White Birch in 1992.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine cancer patients' {{reactions}} to the offer of access <b>to</b> their medical <b>records,</b> hospital doctors' preconceptions of patient access <b>to</b> medical <b>records</b> and the reality of access <b>to</b> <b>records</b> for both parties. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 32 patients and 21 hospital doctors. Hospital doctors were also shown letters from their department to the general practitioner and asked about any changes they would have made as a result of knowing about patient access <b>to</b> <b>records.</b> The results showed that most patients were able to judge for themselves if they wanted access or not and that patients who chose to look at their <b>records</b> found access <b>to</b> their <b>records</b> helpful and reassuring even if the news was bad. Doctors expected access <b>to</b> <b>records</b> <b>to</b> be harmful to patients but would not have wished to amend many of the letters they had written. Patient access <b>to</b> <b>records</b> can be a safe and useful adjunct to good patient care...|$|R
