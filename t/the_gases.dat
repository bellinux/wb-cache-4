5|$|Plinian eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering Plinian eruptions starts in the magma chamber, where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the magma. <b>The</b> <b>gases</b> vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through the magma conduit. These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> and associated magma up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> even faster.|$|E
5|$|Like most insects, beetles inhale air, for {{the oxygen}} it contains, and exhale carbon dioxide, via a {{tracheal}} system. Air enters the body through spiracles, and circulates within the haemocoel {{in a system}} of tracheae and tracheoles, through whose walls <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> can diffuse.|$|E
5|$|The Merlin {{consumed}} {{an enormous}} volume of air {{at full power}} (equivalent to the volume of a single-decker bus per minute), and with the exhaust gases exiting at 1,300mph (2,100km/h) it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by angling <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> backwards instead of venting sideways.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gas</b> relief ports {{are located}} on <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> tube like <b>the</b> AK-47, unlike the AKM which had <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> relief ports {{relocated}} forward to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> block.|$|R
30|$|Large gas {{emission}} in goaf. Local {{gas emission}} in goaf showed that <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> emission often exceeded <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> limit at <b>the</b> zone between the 110 th support and upper {{corner of the}} coalface; at the window of top coal caving and the gap between supports, <b>the</b> measured <b>gas</b> concentration reached 2  %– 3  %, sometimes even higher. At U-type ventilation coalface, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> concentration seriously exceeded <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> limit in <b>the</b> upper corner of the working face. Without taking any measures in the upper corner, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> emission concentration often exceeded 5  %.

50|$|This {{design was}} {{developed}} by John Burgener of Burgener Research Inc. Here, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> stream and sample run through the nebulizer in parallel capillaries. At {{the tip of the}} nebulizer, the liquid is pulled into <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> stream by surface tension along a spout dipping into <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> stream. This allows <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> to impact <b>the</b> liquid, and has the liquid interact in the center of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> flow where <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> flow speed is highest, producing a better transfer of energy from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> to <b>the</b> liquid, and producing a finer droplet size. The Burgener Mira Mist nebulizers are the main products using the Enhanced Parallel Path method.|$|R
5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts. <b>The</b> <b>gases</b> were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> would be to the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|A {{snow melting}} vehicle works by {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. <b>The</b> <b>gases</b> from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{operation}} conditions (the vibration intensity and gas flow rate) on <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> holdup in a 16. 6 cm i. d. two-phase reciprocating plate column (RPC) were studied. Distilled water and aqueous solutions of carboxymethyl-cellulose of different concentration {{were used as}} the liquid phase and air as <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> phase in this investigation. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> holdup was measured after <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> flow and <b>the</b> reciprocating action had been stopped. An empirical correlation which correlates <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> holdup with <b>the</b> specific power consumption and <b>the</b> superficial <b>gas</b> velocity showed that the aeration intensity had a greater influence on <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> holdup than <b>the</b> intensity of agitation. Because <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> holdup was approximately the same in RPC's of different diameters, an equation relating <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> holdup with <b>the</b> specific power consumption and <b>the</b> superficial <b>gas</b> velocity was derived. The correlation {{could be used in}} the scaling up of reciprocating plate columns...|$|R

5|$|In 1941, Frisch {{moved to}} London {{to work with}} Chadwick and his cyclotron. Frisch built a Clusius tube there to study the {{properties}} of uranium hexafluoride. Frisch and Chadwick discovered that {{it is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> for which the Clusius method will not work. This was only a minor setback because Simon was already in progress of establishing the alternative method of separation through ordinary gaseous diffusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom was apparent, {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. <b>The</b> <b>gases</b> were trapped in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 2013, propene was {{detected}} in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, using its composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS). This {{is the first time}} propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft's first close flyby of Titan in 1980, during which it was discovered that many of <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> that make up Titan's brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun's ultraviolet photolysis of methane.|$|E
30|$|Unbalanced <b>gas</b> {{emission}}. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> {{emission sources}} at the LLTCC coalface in Tashan mine {{can be divided}} into three parts, one is <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> at <b>the</b> top position of the goaf including <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> in <b>the</b> upper adjacent layer; the second is <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> in <b>the</b> deep part of the goaf including <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> of <b>the</b> lower adjacent layer; the third is <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> from coal extraction and caving operation carried by the airflow leakage in the working face. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> emission in <b>the</b> three sources discussed above will be affected by face pressure, upper roof caving and top coal caving, and present the characteristics of imbalance, and the uneven emission coefficient might reach 1.8.|$|R
50|$|This gas {{expansion}} propagates a shock wave. The density {{difference of}} <b>the</b> expanding <b>gas</b> bubble from <b>the</b> surrounding water causes the bubble to rise toward the surface. Unless the explosion is shallow enough to vent <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> bubble to <b>the</b> atmosphere during its initial expansion, {{the momentum of}} water moving away from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> bubble will create a gaseous void of lower pressure than the surrounding water. Surrounding water pressure then collapses <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> bubble with inward momentum causing excess pressure within <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> bubble. Re-expansion of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> bubble then propagates another potentially damaging shock wave. Cyclical expansion and contraction continues until <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> bubble vents to the atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>gas</b> flow of a {{disruption}} mitigation valve (DMV) has been analysed {{by using a}} Michelson interferometer. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> flow follows <b>the</b> JET design where <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> is injected via a 4 m long and 4 cm inner diameter tube. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> densities of helium, neon and argon are measured at three locations along the tube with high time resolution. At the valve exit, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> pulse has a rise time of less than 1 ms; <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> pulse rise time is smeared out and delayed on its passage through the tube. For <b>the</b> favoured Ar <b>gas,</b> <b>the</b> rise time and the delay time become about 11 ms each while for He the delay amounts to 4 ms and the rise time 2 ms. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> velocity depends on <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> species but only weakly on the filling pressure. The output density amplitude increases nearly linearly with the filling pressure of the DMVs...|$|R
5|$|Subsequently, {{the cloud}} {{collapsed}} as <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> expanded and lost their capability {{to support their}} solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Peléan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii. Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{can be measured}} from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit of Venus occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able to analyse sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique to analyse light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001, {{this was the first}} opportunity to gain conclusive results in this way on the atmosphere of Venus since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering the lack of information on the atmosphere between 65 and 85km. The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the {{upper atmosphere}} of Venus, but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The atmosphere of mostly CO2, absorbs near-infrared radiation, making it easy to observe. During the 2004 transit, the absorption in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength revealed the properties of <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> at that altitude. The Doppler shift of <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> also enabled wind patterns to be measured.|$|E
30|$|The closer the {{composition}} of <b>the</b> injected <b>gas</b> be to <b>the</b> composition of <b>the</b> pipeline <b>gas,</b> <b>the</b> better will be the mixing of <b>the</b> reservoir <b>gas</b> with <b>the</b> injected <b>gas</b> and <b>the</b> higher will be <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> condensate recovery.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gas</b> key is {{extended}} beyond its normal length {{to form an}} operation rod, such as an M14 or AK-47, extending {{into the top of}} the forward handguard. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> key contains <b>the</b> return spring which is fixed between the front of the receiver and the collar at the front of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> key. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> tube runs backwards from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> block in <b>the</b> front sight base and enters <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> key. In this way when the firearm fires at least some of <b>the</b> combustion <b>gases</b> from inside <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> tube are vented into the handguard area rather than the receiver. This means the standard buffer assembly is not required {{at the rear of the}} weapon, allowing a folding stock to be fitted to reduce the overall length of the weapon.|$|R
50|$|As the {{pipeline}} enters the compressor station <b>the</b> natural <b>gas</b> passes through scrubbers, strainers or filter separators. These are vessels designed {{to remove any}} free liquids or dirt particles from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> before it enters the compressors. Though {{the pipeline}} is carrying “dry gas,” some water and hydrocarbon liquids may condense out of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> stream as <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> cools and moves through the pipeline. Any liquids that may be produced are collected and stored for sale or disposal. A piping system directs <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> from <b>the</b> separators to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> compressor for compression.|$|R
5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect {{is to increase the}} concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the nucleus is {{generally}} dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds, which may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ethanol, and ethane and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. In 2009, {{it was confirmed that}} the amino acid glycine had been found in the comet dust recovered by NASA's Stardust mission. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the Joule–Thomson {{effect is}} {{achieved}} by allowing <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> to expand through a throttling device (usually a valve) which must be very well insulated to prevent any heat transfer to or from <b>the</b> <b>gas.</b> No external work is extracted from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> during <b>the</b> expansion (<b>the</b> <b>gas</b> must not be expanded through a turbine, for example).|$|R

5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds {{almost exclusively on}} carrion. It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> produced by {{the beginnings of the}} process of decay in dead animals. In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
5|$|While some 55 ionic {{species have}} been {{reported}} in fresh ash leachates the most abundant species usually found are the cations Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and the anions Cl−, F− and SO42−. Molar ratios between ions present in leachates suggest that in many cases these elements are present as simple salts such as NaCl and CaSO4. In a sequential leaching experiment on ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, chloride salts were found to be the most readily soluble, followed by sulfate salts Fluoride compounds are in general only sparingly soluble (e.g., CaF2, MgF2), with the exception of fluoride salts of alkali metals and compounds such as calcium hexafluorosilicate (CaSiF6). The pH of fresh ash leachates is highly variable, depending on the presence of an acidic gas condensate (primarily as a consequence of <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> SO2, HCl and HF in the eruption plume) on the ash surface.|$|E
5|$|Halley is {{the most}} active of all the {{periodic}} comets, with others, such as Comet Encke and Comet Holmes, being one or two orders of magnitude less active. Its day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapor, 17% carbon monoxide and 3–4% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more-recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The dust particles {{were found to be}} primarily a mixture of carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the outer Solar System, and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The dust particles decreased in size down to the limits of detection (~0.001µm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.|$|E
