25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>and</b> fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

Nobody knows what went on inside of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>and</b> for them to stick together and to play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it says a lot about them."

Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E

2500|$|Linklater was not {{interested}} in turning the book into a big-budget action thriller as had been done in the past because he felt that A Scanner Darkly was [...] "about <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>and</b> what they're all doing in their alternative world and what's going through their minds is really what keeps the story moving". He wanted to keep the budget under $10 million so that he could have more creative control, remain faithful to the book, and make it an animated film.|$|E

The band later performed in Japan with Between the Buried and Me. Drummer Michael Justian rejoined the band in February 2010, shortly after Fickeisen departed. Fickeisen commented his departure: [...] "There is no easy way to go about leaving a busy band with plans in constant motion, but a little abruptly, I chose to depart from manning the kit for The Red Chord. I have had a great time {{for the past five years}} with <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> <b>and</b> wouldn't exchange it for anything. Touring is tough; everyone who's done it knows that. (...)

For all of the concerns that I've just been talking about. The uncertainty of the intelligence. The consequences of it going bad. The risk to the lives of the Americans involved.

We can control the game and nobody will get hurt except the gamblers. Now I'm one of the guys. Peer pressure." ...|$|R

5000|$|Matthew Sievers of SF Media said, [...] "...this song's lyrical {{content is}} the best I've seen <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> achieve <b>and</b> {{that is a real}} testament.

5000|$|Drake is Jewish. In his autobiography, Jerry Butler {{referred}} to Drake as [...] "the Tom Selleck of smut", stating {{that he had}} a [...] "solid foundation, a skyscraper with a mustache".

It hurts when anyone dies young, but when you see the backgrounds of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>and</b> the path they've taken to try to find some light in their lives, it hurts to see them die young." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Rickly, he elaborated on the revolving line-up of United Nations, stating: [...] "The reason that we've {{been able to}} kind of get away with playing when we want to is because we change members and because we've never copyrighted any of the songs to any member. So, it's really hard to say who made what and who was just playing United Nations for a little while. That's something that has protected us — the anonymity of the band, the changing nature of the band — it's like, 'Well i was only in it for a little while, and then it was <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> <b>and</b> then it was <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> <b>and</b> then it was these guys...'" [...] In the same interview, managing editor of Alternative Press Scott Heisel asked Rickly if, because he is the only well-known member of United Nations, he was afraid of taking the full blame for any of the band's controversial or potentially illegal activity. He responded: [...] "I don't feel like many bands take chances anymore. There's {{a lot of talk about}} being punk and revolutionary and this and that, but it's also awfully safe — punk seems awfully safe to me now, so I like the idea of doing something that's actually dangerous." ...|$|E
5000|$|Grisham {{also said}} of the club, [...] "They'd come out of Zubie's drunk, and there'd be fights every night.

5000|$|Allmusic critic Zac Johnson was {{critical}} of the album, writing the live performance [...] "seems clumsy and a little disturbing... and the various jokes about gays and masturbation seem awfully creepy from <b>these</b> <b>guys...</b> <b>and</b> while their humor on their original LPs seems bright and original, in 1989 their onstage banter seems forced, a little mean-spirited, and rarely funny. Unlike seasoned artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, whose journeys through life and show business have added some wisdom and depth to their performances, the Kingston Trio's travels seem to have made them seem more like Vegas comedians performing way off the strip." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dustin Brown: “Its been great. I watched IPTL {{last year}} on my TV so {{to be part of}} it this year it’s been great. Ii was very happy when I got the call after Wimbledon.

Its great to be able to call <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>and</b> ask for help. We have a really good chemistry on and off the court and that definitely made the difference in us getting the win today.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, Becca replies with {{her side of}} the story. I was signed to Sony Japan before meeting <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>and</b> my {{contract}} had just ended earlier that year. I had never been in a band before and I was open to just about anything. I was contacted by a friend who told me that {{they were looking for a}} singer, so I decided to go meet them and sing for them and see what happened. I wasn't expecting this at all!

500|$|According to Paul Mullie, having Froot Loops as O'Neill's breakfast was not scripted, {{and he is}} unsure if {{the loop}} {{reference}} was intentional.

Would you consider using Eggo Waffles instead of Froot Loops?' So I go to <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> [...] <b>and</b> ask, 'How do you feel about waffles?' And they're like, 'No! It's Froot Loops! It's a time loop! No!' Waffle sales were down." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> {{went back}} on tour again, I can see them {{performing}} with He Is Legend and Every Time I Die. There {{is not a single}} ballad on Shock Value, which is a definite plus because it would have ruined the creativity of Twelve Gauge Valentine. Other than confusing lyrics and satire, the major downfall of Shock Value is that it is too short. There is plenty of energy on this record, but rocking out to eleven songs for less than 32 minutes is a catastrophe. Now don't get me wrong -- <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> rock <b>and</b> they do not have one bad song on this album. Shock Value might not live up to its full potential, but it is a good and creative effort. Fans of Southern hardcore music should give this album a listen."

5000|$|... "I loved reggae, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Eddy Grant. At {{the time}} of the first album I even used to wear a rastacap. The song was played by Grbić Grba, Neša Petrović and a young jazz crew, not by Stjepko and Mića. We thought they and Petrović weren't that perfect as these old guys Gut and Mića Marković. Reggae is always played a little bit sloppy. We wanted to have {{something}} like brass players from Jamaica, which never sound like jazz musicians, but as amateurs playing trumpets. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> <b>and</b> Petrović weren't amateurs, but were still young jazzers at the time.
