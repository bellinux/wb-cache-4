2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E

[...] "I will tell you something that will show you that I realize a good deal. I know the difference between Beatrice and Elizabeth. Less than a week ago, I asked Beatrice to marry me.

60|$|The Australian specialists {{agreed that}} the malady was non-parasitic, and that, therefore, it must be nervous.

Still further, I reasoned that in my own climate of California I had always maintained a stable nervous equilibrium. So back I came.|$|E

60|$|I was {{now going}} at {{what seemed like}} a speed of ninety or a hundred miles an hour, with the wind rushing in between my teeth like water over a mill-dam, and I felt sure that if I kept on going down that hill I should soon be {{whirling}} through space like a comet. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of to save myself was to turn into some level place where the thing would stop, but not a crossroad did I pass; but presently I saw a little house standing back from the road, which seemed to hump itself a little at that place so as to be nearly level, and {{over the edge of the}} hump it dipped so suddenly that I could not see the rest of the road at all.|$|E

6000|$|... "A tame {{wild animal}} {{is the most}} {{dangerous}} of beasts. My old friend, Dick Rock, a great hunter and guide out of Idaho, laughed at my advice, and got killed by one of his three-year-old bulls. I told him they knew him just well enough to kill him, and they did. My friend, A. H. Cole, of Oxford, Nebraska, tried to rope a Weetah that was too tame to be safe, and the bull killed him. Same with General Bull, a member of the Kansas Legislature, and two cowboys who went into a corral to tie up a tame elk at the wrong time. I pleaded with them not to undertake it. They had not studied animals as I had. That tame elk killed all of them. He had to be shot in order to get General Bull off his great antlers. You see, a wild animal must learn to respect a man. The way I used to teach the Yellowstone Park bears to be respectful and safe neighbors was to rope them around the front paw, swing them up on a tree clear of the ground, and whip them with a long pole. It was a dangerous business, and looks cruel, but it is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find to make the bears good. You see, they eat scraps around the hotels and get so tame they will steal everything but red-hot stoves, and will cuff the life out of those who try to shoo them off. But after a bear mother has had a licking, she not only becomes a good bear {{for the rest of her}} life, but she tells all her cubs about it with a good smack of her paw, for emphasis, and teaches them to respect peaceable citizens generation after generation.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she answered, [...] "I have not. I {{followed}} you to England to {{get those}} papers back, either by theft, or by appealing to your sense of honour, or by any means which presented themselves. I found by accident that I {{was not the only}} American in London who was over here in search of you. This afternoon I overheard part of a plot in a café in Regent Street between two men, strangers to me, but who had both apparently made up their minds that this particular paper was worth a little more than your life. From them I heard your address. Your valet must be in their pay, for they knew exactly your movements for the night. I heard them plan to come here, and I knew what the end of that would be. I determined to anticipate them. It was not out of any feeling for you, but simply because if the paper got into their hands my cause was lost. So I came on here to warn you, but I had scarcely entered your room before I was aware that some one who had come with very different intentions was already here. We waited--I in the sitting-room, he in that bedroom--waited for you. I pretended to be unconscious of his existence. He seemed to be content to ignore mine. While I was wondering how I should warn you, the telephone bell rang. I answered it, and it was you who spoke. Then I had the idea of carrying on some imaginary conversation with you, which would induce the man who was listening to go away. I did it and he went away. It must have sounded terrible nonsense to you, of course, but it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of {{to get him out of}} the place.
