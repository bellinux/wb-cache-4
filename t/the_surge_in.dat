The interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least the sixth century, and <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope with Islamic invasions and political instability in and after 14th-century CE.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> coal use which {{accompanied}} the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels. The early development of solar technologies {{starting in the}} 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum.|$|E

5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} shale gas, natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to flow to the well bore. <b>The</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} {{costs of the}} Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. <b>The</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing number}} of people, among them Captain William Rooke Creswell, the {{director}} of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was not impressed with the Admiralty, and in 1908 invited the United States Great White Fleet to visit Australia. The visit prompted public enthusiasm for a modern navy and led to the order of two 700-ton s, a purchase that angered the British. <b>The</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> German naval construction in 1909 led the Australian admiralty to change its position on an Australian navy, which resulted in the Naval Defence Act of 1910 being passed which created the Australian navy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high demand for <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> book sales.

The major contributor to the area decrease is therefore climate changes in the 20 th century even though the glacier retreat has been interrupted by short-lived surges.
