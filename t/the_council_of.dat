5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) was {{established}} on 8 November 1917 by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) Government. Article 38 of the 1924 Soviet Constitution {{stated that the}} Council's powers, functions and duties were given to it by the Central Executive Committee (CEC) which supervised the Council's work and legislative acts. <b>The</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> People's Commissars published decrees and decisions that were binding throughout the Soviet Union. In 1946, <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> People's Commissars was transformed into <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ministers (Sovmin) at both all-Union and Union Republic level.|$|E

5|$|The People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was {{established}} in 1917. The Commissar {{was a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the People's Commissars. The People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs replaced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Empire after the October Revolution.

5|$|After {{finishing}} his studies, Kosygin was {{employed as a}} textile mill director. Three years later, he was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Leningrad City Soviets of Working People's Deputies by the Leningrad Communist Party, and the following year he was appointed People's Commissar for Textile and Industry and earned {{a seat on the}} Central Committee (CC). In 1940 Kosygin became a Deputy chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> People's Commissars, and was appointed in 1943 as Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR.|$|E

At a later church council, Giso asserted his {{authority over the}} abbots of Muchelney and Athelney, but failed to uphold the same claim in regards to Thurstan, Abbot of Glastonbury. Previously, he was credited {{as the author of}} Historiola de primordiis episcopatus Somersetensis, a history of the bishops of Wells, but he is no longer considered the author of that work.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{consolidation}} {{to power}} weakened Kosygin's influence and prestige within the Politburo. By the 1970s, when Kosygin's position was given one blow after another, he was frequently hospitalised and at several occasions Kiril Mazurov, the First Deputy chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ministers, acted {{on his behalf}} during Kosygin's absence. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976. After this incident, {{it is said that}} Kosygin changed from having a vibrant personality to being tired and fed up; he, according to people close to him, seemed to have lost the will to continue his work. He twice filed a letter of resignation between 1976 and 1980, but was turned down on both occasions. During Kosygin's sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov to the post of First Deputy Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ministers. Tikhonov, as with Brezhnev, was a conservative, and through his post as First Deputy chairman Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. The powers of the Premier diminished to the point where Kosygin was forced to discuss all decisions made by <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ministers with Brezhnev.|$|E

5|$|Charles II {{returned}} to the throne in 1660 and reinstated <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the Marches in 1661, but the castle never recovered from the war. Richard Vaughan, the Earl of Carbery, was appointed president and given Â£2,000 to renovate the castle, and between 1663 and 1665, a company of infantry soldiers was garrisoned there, overseen by the earl, {{with the task of}} safeguarding the money and contents of the castle as well as the ammunition for the local Welsh militia. <b>The</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the Marches failed to reestablish itself and was finally disbanded in 1689, bringing an end to Ludlow Castle's role in government. Uncared for, the condition of the castle rapidly deteriorated.|$|E

There were eleven dissolutions during PedroII's reign and, of these, ten occurred after consultation with <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> State, which was beyond what was required by the Constitution. A Constitutional balance of power existed between the General Assembly and the executive branch under the Emperor. The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly. The system functioned smoothly only when both Assembly and Emperor acted in a spirit of cooperation for the national good.|$|E
