This reduces the reflectivity of sound back to the audience (providing better acoustic characteristics), lets a sound system project through the dome from behind (offering sound that seems to come from appropriate directions related to a show), and allows air circulation through the projection surface for climate control.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{concerns}} about {{the inability of the}} [...] L7 tank gun then in use across NATO forces to penetrate new Soviet armor, as proved in German tests on four T-62 Soviet tanks captured by Israel following the June 1967 Six Day War, Rheinmetall was paid {{for the development of a}} new tank gun, a project started in 1965, as the Bundeswehr felt a more powerful gun was needed for its new tanks. The first instance of a larger Soviet tank gun was witnessed on the chassis of a modified T-55 in 1961. In 1965, the Soviet Union's T-62 made its first public appearance, armed with a [...] smoothbore tank gun. The Soviet decision to increase the power of its tank's main armament had come when, in the early 1960s, an Iranian tank commander defected over the Soviet border in a brand-new M60 Patton tank, which was armed with the British Royal Ordnance L7. Despite the introduction of the T-62, in 1969 their T-64 tank was rearmed with a new [...] tank gun, while in 1972 Nizhny Tagil began production of the T-72 tank, also armed with the [...] gun. For example, at the fighting at Sultan Yakoub, during the 1982 Lebanon War, the Israeli government claimed to have destroyed nine Syrian T-72s with the Merkava main battle tank, armed with an Israeli production version of the American M68 [...] tank gun (which in turn was based on the British L7). Whether or not true, the Soviets test-fired a number of Israeli M111 Hetz armor-piercing discarding sabot rounds at Kubinka, finding the [...] round was able <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> the T-72's sloped front section plate but not its turret armor. In response, the Soviets developed the T-72M1. This led Israel to opt for a 120mm tank gun during the development process of the MerkavaIII main battle tank. This case is similar to the American decision to replace the M68 [...] tank gun with Rheinmetall's 120mm gun in 1976; the introduction of the T-64A had raised the question within the armor community whether the new ammunition for the existing gun caliber could effectively deal with the new Soviet tank.|$|E

2500|$|Firing a [...] bullet at [...] from a [...] barrel, the 6mm U.S.N. was the highest-velocity {{cartridge}} used by {{any military}} {{force at the}} time of its adoption. [...] Designed to achieve better penetration than the Army's [...]30 Army cartridge used in the Model 1892/98 (Krag) rifle, the round was intended <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> the hulls of small enemy craft such as patrol and torpedo boats, and could penetrate [...] of soft wood at , [...] of low-carbon steel at 10 feet (3m); 0.375-inch (9.5mm) of ordinary boiler plate at , or a -thick suspended chrome steel alloy boiler plate at [...] The [...] roundnosed bullet had a flatter trajectory than its [...] predecessor at all ranges up to 500 yards; above this distance, the heavier bullet began to show an advantage. [...] The new loading had an effective range (individual rifle fire) of around 600-700 yards, at which point the blunt-tip bullet rapidly lost velocity and energy. [...] The [...] bullet, like its predecessor, demonstrated an inclination to instability unless rapidly rotated. The M1895 Lee rifle therefore received a rapid barrel rifling twist of one turn in 7.5 inches (19cm) (with right-hand twist) to keep the bullet from wobbling or tumbling at extended ranges. At some point, this rifling was changed in later production rifles to one turn in 10 inches RH (25cm). [...] Contemporary medical reports of the day noted the [...] bullet produced noticeably greater damage to tissue and bone than other military cartridges of the day when fired at full velocity (2,560 fps), and the bullet's copper jacket frequently fragmented or detached entirely from its lead core after penetrating a hard substance such as bone or metal. On the other hand, when the 6mm bullet struck muscle or air-filled cavities such as the lungs, the bullet tended to make a perforating wound of small diameter that caused little damage.|$|E

Sheldon aimed at the centre of his chest, then deliberately shifted the aim to his right shoulder, and, with the thought, [...] "That will put him out of business," [...] pulled the trigger.

60|$|We {{had been}} at sea a fortnight, when {{happening}} to allude to the pearl fishery, I bethought me of my own prizes. A ship that carries a numerous crew, {{is a sort of}} omnium gatherum, of human employments. For ordinarily manned craft, seamen are necessary; but ships of war, privateers and letters-of-marque, can afford, as poor Marble would express it, to generalize. We had several tradesmen in the Crisis--mechanics, who found the restraints of a ship necessary for their own good--and, among others, we happened to have a goldsmith. This man had offered <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> my pearls, and to string them; an operation to which I consented. The fellow had performed his task as well as could be desired, and supplying from his own stores a pair of suitable clasps, had formed the whole into a simple, but as beautiful a necklace, as I ever laid eyes on. He had put the largest pearl of all directly in the centre, and then arranged the remainder, by placing several of the smaller together separated by one of the second size, until the whole formed a row that would much more than encircle my own neck, and which, of course, would drop gracefully round that of a female.|$|E
60|$|As far as I have seen, it {{is always}} humble-bees which first bite the holes, and they are well fitted for the work by {{possessing}} powerful mandibles; but hive-bees afterwards profit by the holes thus made. Dr. Hermann Muller, however, writes to me that hive-bees sometimes bite holes through the flowers of Erica tetralix. No insects except bees, with the single exception of wasps {{in the case of}} Tritoma, have sense enough, as far as I have observed, to profit by the holes already made. Even humble-bees do not always discover that it would be advantageous to them <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> certain flowers. There is an abundant supply of nectar in the nectary of Tropaeolum tricolor, yet I have found this plant untouched in more than one garden, while the flowers of other plants had been extensively perforated; but a few years ago Sir J. Lubbock's gardener assured me that he had seen humble-bees boring through the nectary of this Tropaeolum. Muller has observed humble-bees trying to suck at the mouths of the flowers of Primula elatior and of an Aquilegia, and, failing in their attempts, they made holes through the corolla; but they often bite holes, although they could with very little more trouble obtain the nectar in a legitimate manner by the mouth of the corolla.|$|E
