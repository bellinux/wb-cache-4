25|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of {{testosterone}} in blood is about 70 minutes, {{so it is}} necessary to have a continuous supply of the hormone for masculinization.|$|E
25|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of {{progesterone}} {{in circulation}} is only approximately 5 minutes. However, with OMP, peak concentrations of progesterone are seen about 2 to 3 hours after ingestion and the <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> is extended at about 16 to 18 hours. Significantly elevated serum levels of progesterone are maintained for about 12 hours and levels do {{not return to}} baseline until at least 24 hours have passed. In any case, due to the relatively short terminal half-life/duration of action of OMP, it is often prescribed in divided doses of two or even three times daily.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the only}} {{currently}} available study, [...] "the mean <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of bevirimat ranged from 56.3 to 69.5 hours, and the mean clearance ranged from 173.9 to 185.8 mL/hour." ...|$|R
50|$|Intravenous {{dexmedetomidine}} exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with a rapid distribution half-life {{of approximately}} 6 minutes and a <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of approximately 2 hours. Plasma protein binding of dexemedotomindine is ~94% (mostly albumin).|$|R
25|$|Biodistribution of 14C-labelled {{docetaxel}} {{in three}} patients showed {{the bulk of}} the drug to be metabolised and excreted in bile to the faeces. Of the radioactively labelled docetaxel administered, 80% was eliminated to the faeces with 5% in the urine over seven days, an indication that urinary excretion of docetaxel is minimal. Saliva contributed minimal excretion and no excretion was detected through pulmonary means. The <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of docetaxel was determined as approximately 86 hours, through prolonged plasma sampling, contrary to the clinically stated <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of 10–18 hours.|$|E
25|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of clomipramine {{is approximately}} 50%. Peak plasma concentrations occur around 2–6hours (with {{an average of}} 4.7hours) after taking clomipramine orally and {{are in the range}} of 56–154ng/mL (178–489nmol/L). Steady-state concentrations of clomipramine are around 134–532ng/mL (426–1,690nmol/L), with an average of 218ng/mL (692nmol/L), and are reached after 7 to 14days of repeated dosing. Steady-state concentrations of the active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, are around 230–550ng/mL (730–1,750nmol/L). The volume of distribution (Vd) of clomipramine is approximately 17L/kg. It binds approximately 97–98% to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. Clomipramine is metabolized in the liver mainly by CYP2D6. It has a <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of 32hours, and its N-desmethyl metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, has a <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of approximately 69hours. Clomipramine is mostly excreted in urine (60%) and feces (32%).|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{has a low}} oral {{bioavailability}} of 3.9% {{relative to}} intravenous injection due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The time to peak plasma levels following ingestion is 0.9 to 1.5hours. It {{is reported to have}} an elimination half-life of 2.8hours, although a review of 14 studies found that the mean <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> ranged between 2 and 11hours, and one study even reported a <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of 33hours. Buspirone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and prominent drug interactions with inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme have been observed. Major metabolites of buspirone include 5-hydroxybuspirone, 6-hydroxybuspirone, 8-hydroxybuspirone, and 1-PP. 6-Hydroxybuspirone has been identified as the predominant hepatic metabolite of buspirone, with plasma levels that are 40-fold greater than those of buspirone after oral administration of buspirone to humans. The metabolite is a high-affinity partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 25nM) similarly to buspirone, and has demonstrated occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor in vivo. As such, it is likely {{to play an important role}} in the therapeutic effects of buspirone. 1-PP has also been found to circulate at higher levels than those of buspirone itself and may similarly play a significant role in the clinical effects of buspirone.|$|E
40|$|The direct-acting vasodilator, endralazine, in {{combination}} with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker significantly reduced the blood pressures of normotensive volunteers and of patients with essential hypertension. The mean <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> for endralazine of 136 min in hypertensive patients {{did not differ significantly}} from the 155 min in normotensive subjects. In normal subjects the mean oral bioavailability for endralazine was 75 % and the mean clearance was 780 ml/min. There were no significant pharmacokinetic differences between fast and slow acetylators. The administration of endralazine to steady state in the hypertensive patients was associated with an increase in <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> and a decrease in the rate of absorption. However, there was no accumulation of endralazine with chronic dosing...|$|R
50|$|Since 2001, E4 {{has been}} studied extensively. High oral {{absorption}} and bioavailability with a 2-3 hours elimination half-life in the rat has been established. In the human E4 showed a high and dose-proportional oral bioavailability and a long <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of about 28 hours.|$|R
25|$|Following {{a single}} dose of 500mg, the {{apparent}} <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of azithromycin is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, {{is a major}} route of elimination.

25|$|NET has a <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, {{with a mean}} <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of 8.0 hours. The {{metabolism}} of NET is {{very similar}} to that of testosterone (and nandrolone) and is mainly via reduction of the Δ4 double bond to 5α- and 5β-dihydro-NET, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 keto group to the four isomers of 3,5-tetrahydro-NET. These transformations are catalyzed by 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues such as the pituitary gland, uterus, prostate gland, vagina, and breast. With the exception of 3α,5α- and 3β,5α-tetrahydro-NET, which have significant affinity for the ER and are estrogenic to some degree, the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of NET are inactive in terms of affinity for sex steroid receptors (specifically, the PR, AR, and ER). A small amount of NET is also converted by aromatase into EE. NET is metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation as well, mainly by CYP3A4. Some conjugation (including glucuronidation and sulfation) of NET and its metabolites occurs in spite of steric hindrance by the ethynyl group at C17α. The ethynyl group of NET is preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one study}} {{appears to have}} {{evaluated}} the pharmacokinetics of iprindole. A single oral dose of 60mg iprindole to healthy volunteers {{has been found to}} achieve mean peak plasma concentrations of 67.1ng/mL (236nmol/L) after 2 to 4hours. The mean <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of iprindole was 52.5hours, which is notably much longer than that of other TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine. Following chronic treatment with 90mg/day iprindole for 3weeks, plasma concentrations of the drug ranged between 18 and 77ng/mL (63–271nmol/L). Theoretical steady-state concentrations should be reached by 99% within 15 to 20days of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{can also}} be {{administered}} alternatively via subcutaneous injection, with the aqueous formulation Prolutex in Europe being intended specifically for once-daily administration by this route. This formulation is rapidly absorbed and {{has been found to}} result in higher serum peak progesterone levels relative to intramuscular oil formulations. In addition, subcutaneous injection of progesterone is considered to be easier, safer (less risk of injection site reactions), and less painful relative to intramuscular injection. The <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of this formulation is 13 to 18hours, which is similar to the terminal half-lives of OMP and intramuscular progesterone.|$|E
50|$|When a drug {{which has}} a multicompartmental {{pharmacokinetic}} model is given by intravenous infusion it initially will distribute to the central compartment and then move out of this compartment into one or two peripheral compartments. Once this infusion is discontinued, drug continues {{to move into the}} peripheral compartments until an equilibrium is reached. At this time, the only way drug may leave plasma is by metabolism or excretion. As the plasma concentration falls, the concentration gradient of drug reverses and drug moves from peripheral compartments back into plasma, maintaining the plasma concentration of the drug, often prolonging the pharmacological effect. If an infusion has reached steady state then the context-sensitive half-life is equal to the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of the drug. Otherwise it will be shorter than the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life.</b>|$|R
40|$|By using a {{sensitive}} new assay, the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of the antimalarial piperaquine {{in a healthy}} volunteer {{was estimated to be}} 33 days, which is longer than estimated previously. This result illustrates the importance of extended sampling duration and sensitive assay methodologies in characterizing the disposition of slowly eliminated antimalarial drugs...|$|R
40|$|Buprenorphine (3 micrograms kg- 1) {{was given}} {{intravenously}} as premedication to small children (age 4 - 7 years) undergoing minor surgery. Because {{of the rapid}} decline of the plasma buprenorphine concentrations, the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> could not be estimated reliably. Given this constraint, values of clearance appeared {{to be higher than}} those in adults but values of Vss were similar...|$|R
25|$|Spironolactone {{is rapidly}} and {{extensively}} metabolized {{in the liver}} upon oral administration and has a short <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of 1.4 hours. The major metabolites of spironolactone are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), 6β-hydroxy-7α-thiomethylspironolactone (6β-OH-7α-TMS), and canrenone (7α-desthioacetyl-δ6-spironolactone), and these metabolites have much longer half-lives in comparison (13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively). These metabolites {{are responsible for the}} therapeutic effects of spironolactone, and for this reason, spironolactone is a prodrug. Until fairly recently, the 7α-thiomethylated metabolites of spironolactone had not been identified and it was thought that canrenone was the major active metabolite. However, they have since been characterized and 7α-TMS has been identified as the major metabolite of spironolactone.|$|E
25|$|Because of its C17α methyl group, {{methyltestosterone}} {{has dramatically}} improved oral bioavailability and metabolic stability relative to testosterone, {{and for this}} reason, unlike testosterone, is orally active. The oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone is about 70%, and its <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> is approximately 3hours (range 2.5–3.5hours), {{with a duration of}} action of 1 to 3days. Its duration is described as relatively short among AAS. Methyltestosterone can also be taken buccally or sublingually, and this is said to approximately double its bioavailability. The drug is highly protein-bound, by approximately 98%, including to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) with about 25% of the affinity of testosterone. It is excreted 90% in the urine as conjugates and metabolites, and 6% in feces.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{testosterone}} {{is provided}} exclusively as testosterone undecanoate. It {{is available in}} Europe and Canada, {{but not in the}} United States. Once absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, testosterone is shunted (at very high blood levels) to the liver where it can cause liver damage (albeit very rarely) and worsens some of the adverse effects of testosterone, like lower HDL (good) cholesterol. In addition, the first pass metabolism of the liver also may result in testosterone levels too low to provide satisfactory masculinization and suppress menses. Because of the short <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of testosterone, oral testosterone undecanoate must be administered two to four times per day, preferably with food (which improves its absorption).|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and {{disposition of}} valproic acid (VPA) have been assessed in pregnant sheep after both maternal and fetal iv bolus adminIstration. The time course of VPA and 16 of its metab-olftes was followed in maternal and fetal arterial blood, amniotic fluid, and fetal tracheal fluid for 48 hr after administration. Fetal blood gas, acid-base, metabolic, cardiovascular, and fetal breath-ing activity parameters were also monitored. The disposition of VPA 1 in maternal serum is best {{described by a}} biexponential func-tion with a <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of 2. 13 ± 0. 49 hr and volume of distribution of 0. 242 ± 0. 036 liter/kg. VPA transfer to fetal serum and other fetal fluids was rapid after drug administration. There was significant fetal exposure to VPA after maternal dosing (mean AUC,OFA/AUC,,, = 0. 410 ± 0. 1 18). Similarly, the disposition of VPA in fetal serum after fetal dosing is best described by a biexponential decay with a <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of 3. 37...|$|R
50|$|Patients seek rapid {{onset of}} action to relief the headache. Relatively short tmax, good {{bioavailability}} and lipophilicity are pharmacokinetic properties that {{have been associated with}} rapid {{onset of action}}. It has been speculated that good ability to cross the blood brain barrier and relatively long <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> may result in a lower incidence of headache recurrence. Sumatriptan and rizatriptan undergo first pass hepatic metabolism and result in lower bioavailability.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of desmoteplase {{is similar to}} rt-PA (alteplase), {{but it does not}} contain the plasmin-sensitive cleavage site and the lysine-binding Kringle 2 domain. As a result, desmoteplase, in comparison to rt-PA, has high fibrin selectivity (100,000- v. 550-fold increase in catalytic activity), an absence of neurotoxicity, and no apparent negative effect on the blood-brain barrier. Desmoteplase also has a half-life of about four hours; rtPA has a <b>terminal</b> plasma <b>half-life</b> of about 5 minutes.|$|R
25|$|Clomipramine is {{a strong}} SRI. Its {{affinity}} for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14nM, which is considerably {{higher than that of}} other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were imipramine, amitriptyline, and dosulepin (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4nM, 4.3nM, and 8.3nM, respectively. In addition, clomipramine has a <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> that is around twice as long as that of amitriptyline and imipramine. In spite of these differences however, clomipramine is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of amitriptyline and imipramine. For these reasons, clomipramine is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, clomipramine is similarly potent or even more potent as an SRI than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
25|$|Lumiracoxib {{is unique}} amongst the coxibs {{in being a}} weak acid. It was {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. The acidic nature of lumiracoxib allows it to penetrate well into areas of inflammation. It has shown to be rapidly and well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring in about 1–3 hours. A study showed that when a subject was given 400nbsp&mg dose, the amount of unchanged drug in the plasma 2.5 hours postdose suggest a modest first pass effect. The <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> in plasma ranged from 5.4 to 8.6 hours (mean =6.5 hours). The half-life in synovial fluid is considerably longer than in plasma, and the concentration in synovial fluid 24 hours after administration would be expected to result in a substantial COX-2 inhibition. This fact can explain why some users may suffice with once-daily dosage despite a short plasma half-life. The major plasma metabolites are 5-carboxy, 4’-hydroxy, and 4’-hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives. Lumiracoxib is extensively metabolized before it is excreted, and the excretion routes are in the urine or feces. Peak plasma concentrations exceed those necessary to maximally inhibit COX-2, and that is consistent with a longer pharmacodynamic half-life. In vitro lumiracoxib has demonstrated a greater COX-2 selectivity {{than any of the other}} coxibs.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>half-life</b> of DHT in {{the body}} (53minutes) is longer than that of {{testosterone}} (34minutes), and this may account {{for some of the}} difference in their potency.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Combination {{therapy with}} interferon-alpha and {{ribavirin}} {{is considered the}} treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis C. However, interferon-alpha may induce severe depression It {{has been suggested that}} interferon-alpha is able to modify cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 2 and 2 D 6 activity. We therefore decided to study the effects of the interferon-alpha- 2 b pegylated derivative on fluoxetine disposition in patients receiving combination chemotherapy for chronic hepatitis C. Methods: After approval by the institutional ethics committee, 20 adult patients with chronic hepatitis C, but with no history of other liver diseases, were prospectively admitted to the study, which included phenotyping by means of a dextromethorphan test and evaluation of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine pharmacokinetic parameters (the area under the serum concentration-time curve, maximum serum concentration, time to reach the maximum serum concentration and <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life)</b> before and after 2 months of continuous peginterferon-alpha- 2 b therapy. Results: The only statistically Significant difference we observed was a significant reduction in the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of fluoxetine (from 4730 to 33. 23 hours; p= 0. 014) after peginterferon-alpha- 2 b treatment. Conclusion: These data suggest that interferon-alpha may induce, rather than inhibit, the biotransformation of fluoxetine...|$|R
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of zopiclone {{in humans}} are stereoselective. After oral {{administration of the}} racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are {{higher than those of}} the respective antipodes.|$|R
30|$|We {{may also}} {{consider}} the effect of repeatedly administrated epinephrine on the aorta shortly after death because the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of epinephrine is approximately 8 – 13  minutes after intravenous administration (Gu et al. 1999). Epinephrine increases the CPR-generated aortic pressure via alpha-adrenergic–mediated vasoconstriction, which increases the coronary perfusion pressure by decreasing the blood flow to all other organs (Callaway 2012). In this case, {{the tone of the}} ascending thoracic aorta connected to the coronary arteries is preserved, but downstream aorta, such as the abdominal aorta, loss of tone with the reduced elasticity.|$|R
2500|$|The {{half-life}} is complex; {{according to}} the label: [...] "After a distribution phase, elimination is at first slow, the concentration decreasing by a half between about 12 and 72 hours, and then more rapid, giving an elimination half-life of 18 hours.

30|$|Pharmacokinetics {{parameters}} {{from the}} human plasma samples were calculated by a non-compartmental statistic model using WinNon-Lin 5.0. software (Pharsight, USA). Blood samples were taken {{for a period of}} 3 to 5 times the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> (t 1 / 2) and it was considered as the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) ratio higher than 80 % as per FDA guidelines. Plasma FB concentration-time profiles were visually inspected, and Cmax and Tmax values were determined. The AUC 0 –t was obtained by the trapezoidal method. AUC 0 –∞ was calculated up to the last measureable concentration and extrapolations were obtained using the last measureable concentration and the terminal elimination rate constant (Ke) it was estimated from the slope of the terminal exponential phase of the plasma of the FB concentration-time curve (by means of the linear regression method). The <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> (t 1 / 2), was then calculated as 0.693 /Ke. Regarding AUC 0 –t, AUC 0 –∞ and Cmax bioequivalence were assessed by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and calculating the standard 90 % confidence intervals (90 % CIs) of the ratio's test/reference (logarithmically transformed data).

40|$|Malaria is {{associated}} with a reduction in the systemic clearance and apparent volume of distribution of the cinchona alkaloids; this reduction is proportional to the disease severity. There is increased plasma protein binding, predominantly to alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein, and elimination half-lives (in healthy adults quinine t 1 / 2 z = 11 hours, quinidine t 1 / 2 z = 8 hours) are prolonged by 50 %. Systemic clearance is predominantly by hepatic biotransformation to more polar metabolites (quinine 80 %, quinidine 65 %) and the remaining drug is eliminated unchanged by the kidney. Quinine is well absorbed by mouth or following intramuscular injection even in severe cases of malaria (estimated bioavailability more than 85 %). Quinine and chloroquine may cause potentially lethal hypotension if given by intravenous injection. Chloroquine is extensively distributed with an enormous total apparent volume of distribution (Vd) more than 100 L/kg, and a <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of 1 to 2 months. As a consequence, distribution rather than elimination processes determine the blood concentration profile of chloroquine in patients with acute malaria. Parenteral chloroquine should be given either by continuous intravenous infusion, or by frequent intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of relatively small doses. Oral bioavailability exceeds 75 %. Amodiaquine is a pro-drug for the active antimalarial metabolite desethylamodiaquine. Its pharmacokinetic properties are similar to these of chloroquine although the Vd is smaller (17 to 34 L/kg) and the <b>terminal</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> is 1 to 3 weeks...|$|R
