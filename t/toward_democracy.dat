500|$|A UNPA {{might begin}} as an inter-parliamentary institution–an {{assembly}} of parliamentarians from their respective countries' legislatures–and then {{change to a}} directly elected body. This {{would be similar to}} the evolution of the European Parliament. Beginning with the European Common Assembly's founding in 1952, MEPs were appointed by each of the Member States' national parliaments; in 1979, direct election was instituted. Sen. Douglas Roche, O.C., in The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, analyzes the tradeoffs between the two choices. A UNPA based on existing parliamentarians may be easier to establish, because it avoids several hurdles, such as decisions on electoral cycles, a universally acceptable electoral body, legitimacy of elections, and so on: [...] "A body comprising national parliamentarians has the 'stamp of approval' built-in. National parliamentarians can claim electoral legitimacy in their own right. Admittedly, the credibility of domestic franchised can be called into question, but the trend <b>toward</b> <b>democracy</b> has been strengthening rapidly." ...|$|E

2500|$|The rise of {{democratic}} movements across Eastern Europe in the 1980s, the arrival {{in power in}} Moscow of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, and {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989, led to the downfall of Todor Zhivkov, who resigned as Communist Party leader on November 10, 1989. [...] He was succeeded by a new generation of leaders, who turned Bulgaria <b>toward</b> <b>democracy</b> and a market economy. [...] Opposition parties and independent media began to spring up in Sofia, and the new leaders began to re-orient Bulgaria toward Western Europe and the United States.|$|E

According to state TV, the order was given in response to [...] "unrest and terrorist attacks" [...] and [...] "intended to restore security and stability to the people immediately." [...] President Thein Sein added that further unrest could threaten the country's moves <b>toward</b> <b>democracy.</b> It {{was the first time that}} the current government used the provision. It instigated martial law, giving the military administrative control of the region. [...] The move was criticised by Human Rights Watch, who accused the government of handing control over to a military which had historically brutalised people in the region. Some ethnic Rakhine burned Rohingya houses in Bohmu village in retaliation. Over five thousand people were residing at refugee camps by 10 June. [...] Many of the refugees fled to Sittwe to escape the rioting, overwhelming local officials.|$|E
2500|$|Bordiga proudly defined {{himself as}} [...] "anti-democratic", believing {{himself to be}} {{following}} the tradition of Marx and Engels. However, Bordiga's hostility <b>toward</b> <b>democracy</b> was unrelated to the Stalinist narrative of the single-party state. Indeed, he saw Fascism and Stalinism as the culmination of bourgeois democracy. Democracy to Bordiga meant above all the manipulation of society as a formless mass. To this he counterposed the [...] "dictatorship of the proletariat", to be implemented by the Communist Party, based on the principles and program enunciated in the Communist Manifesto. He often referred {{to the spirit of}} Engels' remark that [...] "on the eve of the revolution all the forces of reaction will be against us under the banner of 'pure democracy". (As every factional opponent of the Bolsheviks in 1921 from the monarchists to the anarchists called for [...] "soviets without Bolsheviks" [...] — or soviet workers councils not dominated by Bolsheviks.) Bordiga opposed the idea of revolutionary theory being the product of a democratic process of pluralist views, believing that this perspective has the merit of underscoring the fact that communism, like all social formations, is above all about the expression of programmatic content. This enforces the fact that for Marxists, communism is not an ideal to be achieved but a [...] "real movement" [...] born from the old society with a set of programmatic tasks.|$|E
2500|$|Ruiz de Burton is {{critical}} of US foreign policy in her fiction, accusing it of imperialist and hegemonic tendencies, contradictory to its intentions and foundation. [...] In 1823, US President James Monroe delivered a statement declaring the US foreign policy regarding the Western Hemisphere henceforth, which became later known as the Monroe Doctrine. [...] His message declared that the Western Hemisphere's move <b>toward</b> <b>democracy</b> and away from monarchy was inevitable and that the United States would usher in that transformation and protect {{any country in the}} Americas from future colonization by any European powers. [...] This Doctrine remained virtually ignored in US politics until President James Polk told Congress in 1845 that [...] "The American system of government is entirely different from that of Europe...a system of self-government which seems natural to our soil and which will ever resist foreign interference". [...] However, the character Don Felipe in The Squatter and the Don says [...] "Of course the ideas of this continent are different from those of Europe, be we all know that such would not be the case if the influence of the United States did not prevail with such despotic sway over the minds of the leading men of the Hispanic American republics. [...] If it were not for this terrible, this fatal influence - which will eventually destroy us- the Mexicans, instead of seeing anything objectionable in the proposed change, would be proud to hail a prince who, after all, has some sore of claim to this land, and who will cut us loose from the leading strings of the United States." ...|$|E

60|$|Let us take as an {{illustration}} such a measure as state purchase of railways. This is a typical object of state socialism, thoroughly practicable, already achieved in many countries, and clearly the sort of step that must be taken in any piecemeal approach to complete collectivism. Yet I {{see no reason to}} believe that any real advance <b>toward</b> <b>democracy,</b> freedom, or economic justice is achieved when a state takes over the railways after full compensation to the shareholders.|$|E
60|$|And {{there is}} no real advance <b>toward</b> <b>democracy.</b> The {{administration}} of the railways will {{be in the hands of}} officials whose bias and associations separate them from labor, and who will develop an autocratic temper through the habit of power. The democratic machinery by which these officials are nominally controlled is cumbrous and remote, and can only be brought into operation on first-class issues which rouse the interest of the whole nation. Even then it is very likely that the superior education of the officials and the government, combined with the advantages of their position, will enable them to mislead the public as to the issues, and alienate the general sympathy even from the most excellent cause.|$|E
6000|$|The next--whether {{before or}} after the first in time, it suits me to speak of him in second place--was the man who was the {{potential}} ancestor of the whole Ritterschaft, Chivalry, and knightly caste of Europe; the man who first, finding a foal upon the steppe, deserted by its dam, brought it home, and reared it; and then bethought him of the happy notion of making it draw--presumably by its tail--a fashion which endured long in Ireland, and had to be forbidden by law, I think as late as the sixteenth century. A great aristocrat must that man have become. A greater still he who first substituted the bit for the halter. A greater still he who first thought of wheels. A greater still he who conceived the yoke and pole for bearing up his chariot; for that same yoke, and pole, and chariot, became the peculiar instrument of conquerors like him who mightily oppressed the children of Israel, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron. Egyptians, Syrians, Assyrians, Greeks, Romans--none of them improved on the form of the conquering biga, till it was given up by a race who preferred a pair of shafts to their carts, and who had learnt to ride instead of drive. A great aristocrat, again, must he have been among those latter races who first conceived the notion of getting on his horse's back, accommodating his motions to the beast's, and becoming a centaur, half-man, half-horse. That invention must have tended, in the first instance, as surely <b>toward</b> <b>democracy</b> as did the invention of firearms. A tribe of riders must have been always, more or less, equal and free. Equal because a man on a horse would feel himself a man indeed; because the art of riding called out an independence, a self-help, a skill, a consciousness of power, a personal pride and vanity, which would defy slavery. Free, because a tribe of riders might be defeated, exterminated, but never enchained. They could never become gleboe adscripti, bound to the soil, as long as they could take horse and saddle, and away. History gives us more than one glimpse of such tribes--the scourge and terror of the non-riding races with whom they came in contact. Some, doubtless, remember how in the wars between Alfred and the Danes, [...] "the army" [...] (the Scandinavian invaders) again and again horse themselves, steal away by night from the Saxon infantry, and ride over the land (whether in England or in France), [...] "doing unspeakable evil." [...] To that special instinct of horsemanship, which still distinguishes their descendants, we may attribute mainly the Scandinavian settlement of the north and east of England. Some, too, may recollect the sketch of the primeval Hun, as he first appeared to the astonished and disgusted old Roman soldier Ammianus Marcellinus; the visages [...] "more like cakes than faces;" [...] the [...] "figures like those which are hewn out with an axe on the poles at bridge-ends;" [...] the rat-skin coats, which they wore till they rotted off their limbs; their steaks of meat cooked between the saddle and the thigh; the little horses on which [...] "they eat and drink, buy and sell, and sleep lying forward along his narrow neck, and indulging in every variety of dream." [...] And over and above, and more important politically, the common councils [...] "held on horseback, under the authority of no king, but content with the irregular government of nobles, under whose leading they force their way through all obstacles." [...] A race--like those Cossacks who are probably their lineal descendants--to be feared, to be hired, to be petted, but not to be conquered.|$|E
