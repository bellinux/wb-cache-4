5|$|Morrison {{entered a}} {{classroom}} {{on the second}} floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith {{asked him what he}} was doing in the classroom, he pulled out his handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several female students to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students {{must be able to}} look at a word, form an image of that word in their minds and be able to recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard,</b> have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E

25|$|For the program's first 25 years, weather {{reports were}} {{delivered}} by the host or newsreader. Dave Garroway illustrated the day's forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> weather map concept, and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map. When the show converted to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair's retirement on March 14, 1975, Lew Wood took over the newsreader and weather reporting duties. When Floyd Kalber was brought in as newsreader in 1976, Wood was relegated to weather, sports, roving reporter assignments, and presenting live on-air commercials until his departure in 1978.|$|E
25|$|At 10:41, {{a second}} caller {{reported}} the incident, and {{was transferred to}} the State Police. At 10:55, Roberts was reaching the final stages of his plan. He had arranged the bound girls {{at the front of the}} classroom, near <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> Roberts made two cell phone calls, one to his wife and the next to police. He warned the 911 dispatcher that if state police were not off the property in two seconds, he would kill the children. The dispatcher attempted to delay him and put him in touch with the State Police, but Roberts ended the call. Two of the girls then began negotiating with Roberts. They pleaded for him to shoot them first. This allowed the girls a little extra time for possible rescue. At approximately 11:07a.m., Roberts followed through with his threats and the sound of rapid gunfire was heard. At 10:58, Mrs. Roberts called 911 after arriving home from a prayer study group meeting. She had discovered a suicide note left on the kitchen table and had received a brief and disturbing emotional phone call from her husband. The 911 dispatcher put her in touch with State Police.|$|E
50|$|Several mathematicians work as {{consultants}} {{for each}} episode.

50|$|In {{the same}} vein as Shinbo's {{previous}} series, Pani Poni Dash!, the anime features a plethora of parodies and references to popular culture, many of which appear seemingly randomly on <b>the</b> <b>chalkboards</b> in classroom scenes. Abundant eyecatches and light-hearted omake shorts {{at the end of}} each episode are also of a generally parodic nature. The use of parodies adds to an already plentiful use of humor into the series.|$|R
500|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of many Simpsons episodes, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart {{can be seen}} writing a message on <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> This message, which changes from episode to episode, {{has become known as}} the [...] "chalkboard gag". Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as [...] "The First Amendment does not cover burping", pop culture references such as [...] "I can't see dead people", and meta-references such as [...] "I am not a 32 year old woman" [...] and [...] "Nobody reads these anymore". The animators are able to produce <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events. For example, <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gag for [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992) read, [...] "I will not defame New Orleans." [...] The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in the previous week's episode, [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge", which called the city a [...] "home of pirates, drunks and whores". Many episodes do not feature a chalkboard gag because a shorter opening title sequence, where <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gags are cut, is used to make more room for story and plot development.|$|E

500|$|Approximately {{the first}} half-minute {{of the opening}} {{sequence}} remains the same, with a few oddities: the word [...] "Banksy" [...] is sprayed onto a number of walls and other public spaces; Krusty's billboard advertises that he now performs at funerals (first seen on [...] "Take My Life, Please", but this had [...] "Banksy" [...] on it). <b>The</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gag ("I must not write all over the walls") is written all over the classroom walls, clock, door, and floor.|$|E
500|$|... "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December3,2000.

At that point, the episode was called [...] "Homer the Drudge". <b>The</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gag {{was written by}} staff writer Don Payne, and the couch gag was conceived by producer Laurie Biernackie.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer the Heretic" [...] is {{the third}} episode of The Simpsons fourth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 8, 1992. In the episode, Homer decides to forgo going to church and has an excellent time staying home. His behavior quickly attracts the wrath of God, who visits him in a dream. The episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Jim Reardon. <b>The</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gag from this episode was {{a reference to the}} previous episode [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge", which had made controversial references to New Orleans.|$|E
5000|$|Fundraisers by the {{students}} and community helped {{to raise money for}} <b>the</b> <b>chalkboards</b> and other necessities. The school offered a contest in 1950 for students to choose the school colors and Macks Beasley was named the winner with his selection of kelly-green and white. In 1951, then coach and principal, Mr. Kenneth Waldeck, honored the Musselman family by using an apple theme for the school's mascot. He named the [...] "Applemen" [...] as the mascot and the color red was added to the school colors.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{our research}} {{with a system}} that automatically produces web based education out of regular classroom lectures. In the classroom, the lecturer writes on a wide pen sensitive display in place of <b>the</b> traditional <b>chalkboard.</b> <b>The</b> system records all actions and {{makes it possible to}} replay the lecture from the web at any time. Remote students follow the lecture looking at the dynamic board content and listening to the recorded voice of the instructor. In addition to drawings, <b>the</b> new <b>chalkboard</b> handles a range of multimedia elements from the Internet. Using handwriting recognition, mathematical expressions can be evaluated and functions can be plotted immediately on the board. Since the first release in early 2002, we have gained practical experiences with different use cases and scenarios which we present in this paper. ...|$|R
500|$|All of {{this does}} little to endear Elphaba to Galinda and the feeling is mutual ("What is this Feeling?"). They clash constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with Dr. Dillamond. Dr. Dillamond is the only Animal {{professor}} at the university and is beginning to suffer from discrimination, even from the students, which is shown when someone writes [...] "Animals should be seen and not heard" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> He tells Elphaba that there is a conspiracy to stop the Animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it ("Something Bad").|$|E
500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gag in the episode's opening sequence, Bart backs the Villanova Wildcats, {{who won the}} 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game the {{day after}} the episode aired. Fans {{wondered}} why the show's staff were supporting Villanova over the North Carolina Tar Heels; one Internet writer hypothesized that it was a reference to the season 9 episode [...] "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson", in which after one of his typical alcoholic binges, Barney Gumble can only recall [...] "giving a guest lecture at Villanova, or maybe it was a street corner." ...|$|E
500|$|This was {{the first}} new episode to air {{following}} the release of The Simpsons Movie, and the episode's opening sequence is a callback to the film. Bart writes [...] "I will not wait 20 years to make another movie" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> and skateboards through Springfield, which is still recovering from the dome incident. Several movie characters reappear, including president Schwarzenegger, the Multi-Eyed Squirrel, Colin, Russ Cargill, and the Medicine Woman. We also see that the Simpsons house is still under construction and the silo is strapped to Homer's car. Plopper the pig is also featured {{for the first time}} in the series, during the couch gag and Homer refers to him as [...] "my summer love." ...|$|E
5000|$|Marshall {{gained a}} measure of revenge for the 1940 humiliation two years later, when the teams again met in Washington for the 1942 NFL Championship Game. It was {{reported}} in the Whittingham book that his pre-game [...] "pep talk" [...] consisted solely of writing [...] "73-0" [...] on <b>the</b> locker room's <b>chalkboard.</b> <b>The</b> Redskins defeated the Bears 14-6, handing the Chicagoans their only defeat of the season.|$|R
50|$|The camera zooms {{in through}} the town and then through a window of a {{lavender}} Springfield Elementary, where Bart is writing lines on <b>the</b> class <b>chalkboard</b> as a punishment. When the school bell rings, Bart leaves in a hurry and skateboards {{out of the school}} doors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> opening <b>chalkboard</b> gag makes a {{reference}} to the 2012 phenomenon in which the world was supposed to end on December 21, 2012. Homer, Lenny, and Carl get to see a comic from the comic series The Far Side which includes a lion and an X-ray.|$|R
500|$|Mulder {{arrives at}} the school, where Scully claims that she never called him. They find Mrs. Paddock {{seemingly}} attacked by the remaining faculty members, and go to search for them. The faculty members capture the two agents, convinced {{that they need to}} perform a sacrifice to regain favor with the Devil and make up for their diluted faith before it is too late. As they are about to kill Mulder and Scully, Mrs. Paddock causes them to instead kill themselves, confirming that their attempt was indeed too late. The agents escape their bonds and find Mrs. Paddock missing, with only a parting message on <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> stating, [...] "Goodbye. It's been nice working with you." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} features Otto Mann in a Partridge Family-like bus, while <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gag makes {{a reference}} to the film Inception. The Glee cast members sing a version of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] by the Beach Boys. Krusty the Clown had a Super Bowl [...] "nip slip", appeared on The Electric Company and was seen using a child as a human shield in a similar manner to the character Greg Stillson from The Dead Zone. Lisa listens to This American Life, a public radio program voiced by Ira Glass. Also, Ethan and Kurt have a map of Middle Earth on the wall of their apartment. Krusty's comment that [...] "I ain't gonna play Sun City" [...] is {{a reference to}} Steven van Zandt's famous protest song.|$|E
500|$|During {{the opening}} sequence, Bart {{originally}} wrote [...] "butt.com" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard,</b> however, it was modified to butt.butt, due to butt.com being a real website. The storyline of famous celebrities moving to Springfield was pitched by Mike Scully; Scully originally pitched Bruce Springsteen as the celebrity {{to move to}} town, however, Springsteen turned down the opportunity to appear. Richard Appel then offered the guest appearance opportunity to Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, but they too turned down the offer. Appel then offered Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger the opportunity to provide their voices, and they agreed to guest star in the episode. The episode was originally intended to be directed by Mike B. Anderson, but it was held over from season 9 and Pete Michels directed it.|$|E
5000|$|Following the October 2013 {{death of}} Marcia Wallace, Fox {{paid tribute to}} her with a re-broadcast of [...] "The Ned-Liest Catch" [...] {{preceding}} the premiere of [...] "Four Regrettings and a Funeral"; <b>the</b> latter's <b>chalkboard</b> gag consisted of a single [...] "We'll really miss you Mrs. K".|$|R
40|$|Abstract — eChalk is a {{software}} system that transforms an electronic whiteboard into a teaching tool simulating a traditional chalkboard. In addition to writing and drawings, <b>the</b> electronic <b>chalkboard</b> handles {{a wide range}} of multimedia enhancements. These may be used to enliven the lessons by visualization, allowing the system to surpass the didactic potentials of <b>the</b> traditional <b>chalkboard.</b> <b>The</b> system records all actions and provides both a live transmission and a replay of the lecture from the web as a by-product of regular classroom teaching. Remote students follow the lecture by watching the dynamic board content and listening to the recorded voice of the instructor. While originally created only for the use in the Western hemisphere, recent developments target the support of teaching in the Middle East. From our point of view, advantageous application in particular for teaching in different cultures is characterized. This is especially true for cultures with non-Latin scripts and regions which lack the infrastructure for high-speed Internet connections. Systematic evaluations from regular use at two universities are presented. Index Terms — eChalk, digital chalkboard, digital whiteboard, handwriting recognition, multi-cultural approach I...|$|R
50|$|During {{his early}} years working in {{software}} development, Schultheis said he was captivated and inspired by the beauty of <b>the</b> half-erased <b>chalkboards</b> and whiteboards, with its many layers of mathematical formulas, equations and ghost-like erasures and shapes. He said his paintings are a visually expressive approach to analytical ideas, expanding the definition of conceptual geometry in art. Schultheis says he likens <b>the</b> canvas to <b>chalkboard</b> and paints math equations, their geometric forms that visually render in his mind, and the relationships that develop into geometric models describing narratives about the human condition. His paintings present these geometric equations and forms through a visual mathematical process, language and rendering.|$|R
