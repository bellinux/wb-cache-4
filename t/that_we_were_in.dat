In his 1970 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon commented that Epstein's death {{marked the beginning of}} the end for the group: [...] "I knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> trouble then... I thought, 'We've had it now'". Thirty years after Epstein's death, McCartney said, [...] "Brian would really be happy to hear how much we loved him". The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.|$|E
500|$|Lucinda Dalton was {{the fourth}} wife of Charles Wakeman Dalton, and {{they were married in}} 1868. Lucinda resented the {{expectation}} that she be meek and obedient in her marriage. Charles assured her that husbands have obligations to their wives as wives do to their husbands. She {{came to the conclusion that}} she should marry Charles because of a spiritual witness they experienced together: [...] "I felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the presence of the hosts of heaven; and a direct incontrovertible testimony was given me that it was the will of God and not my will that I should accept this man for my yokefellow." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you all right for boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't want {{to send a message to}} the enemy <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E

500|$|On 25 June 1967, the Beatles {{performed}} their forthcoming single, [...] "All You Need Is Love", to {{an estimated}} 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein {{had been in a}} fragile emotional state, stressed by personal issues. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: [...] "We collapsed. I knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've had it now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{assassination}} of newspaper editor Pedro Chamorro in 1978, Astorga decided {{to take up arms}} against the Somoza regime.

Senator Robert Byrd used the phrase in 1969 when questioning the use of funds to offer professional training to Cuban refugees.

As a result of his intense desire to remember facts, he filled his field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.|$|E

A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck.
