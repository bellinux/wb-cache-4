50|$|Little {{is left of}} {{the works}} today. The Old Works were {{demolished}} as the area around Swan Village was developed into an industrial estate.

The <b>third</b> typical <b>holder</b> type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|R
40|$|The {{carriage}} {{of goods}} by sea starts off with a contract of carriage, an essentially simple and straightforward contract between two parties, the shipper and the carrier. Very often, however, a bill of lading is issued and a third party appears on the scene: the holder {{of the bill of}} lading. The holder was not involved in the making of the contract of carriage, but does have rights, and possibly obligations, against the carrier at destination. The holder of the bill of lading is entitled to claim delivery and has title to sue the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods, but he can also be liable to pay freight or other costs. The question then is how the <b>third</b> party <b>holder</b> of the bill acquires those rights and obligations. The thesis analyzes the different theories that have been proposed to explain the position of the <b>third</b> party <b>holder.</b> In doing so, a distinction is made between contractual theories and non-contractual theories. The former try to explain the holder's position by building on the initial contract of carriage and applying contract law mechanisms. The latter, although obviously not denying the existence of the contract of carriage, construe the position of the <b>third</b> party <b>holder</b> independently. Within the group of contractual theories, there is a further distinction to be made between those theories that have the holder succeed to all of the shipper's rights and obligations and thus have the holder step into the shoes of the shipper, and the theories that see the holder's position as contractual but independent, and thus not necessarily identical to the position of the shipper. Within the first group (contractual, identical position) agency, assignment and novation are looked at. The second group (contractual, non-identical position) includes the third party beneficiary clause, multi-party contracts and accession, and direct contracts between the carrier and the <b>holder.</b> The <b>third</b> group (statutory) includes the bill of lading as a quasi-contract, statutes explicitly or implicitly dealing with the holder's position, the bill of lading as a negotiable instrument, the bill of lading as a voluntary engagement and the bill of lading as part of the Lex Maritima. Following the analysis and appraisal of the different theories, the case is made that the position of the <b>third</b> party <b>holder</b> of the bill of lading is not obvious or self-evident; the question what the holder's position is needs to be asked and answered. It is further argued that, al-though it is easy to understand why contractual approaches were initially chosen and are still preferred, they are nevertheless not the best possible solution. It is submitted that a statutory approach to the position of the holder of the bill of lading has advantages and would be preferable...|$|R
50|$|Stanley was {{appointed}} the Governor General of Canada and Commander in Chief of Prince Edward Island on 1 May 1888.

50|$|Earl of Abingdon is a {{title in}} the Peerage of England. It was created on 30 November 1682 for James Bertie, 5th Baron Norreys of Rycote. He was the eldest son of Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey by his second {{marriage}} to Bridget, 4th Baroness Norreys de Rycote, and the younger half-brother of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey (see the Earl of Lindsey and the Baron Willoughby de Eresby for earlier history of the Bertie family). His mother's family descended from Sir Henry Norris, who represented Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the House of Commons and served as Ambassador to France. In 1572 he was summoned by writ to Parliament as Lord Norreys de Rycote. He was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron. In 1621 he was created Viscount Thame and Earl of Berkshire in the Peerage of England. He had no sons and on his death in 1624 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony by his daughter Elizabeth, the <b>third</b> <b>holder</b> of the title. On her death the title passed to her daughter, the aforementioned Bridget, the fourth Baroness, second wife of the second Earl of Lindsey.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the comment {{is related to the}} recent view {{granting}} the protection provided by article 1168 c. c. to cohabiting partner. The previous prevailing view, which is now outdated, spoke about detention for hospitality reasons, comparing the cohabitee to a guest and denying active legitimation to recovery. More recently, the Supreme Court of Cassation has however pointed out that must be granted a position ascribable to autonomous possession to the cohabitee who enjoys the availability of the property with the partner, possessor or qualified holder of the same property. On this subject, the impression {{is that there is a}} high risk of getting carried away by extra-judicial worries. In any case, if we admit that the title justifying co-possession derives from the emotional bond as if by magic, the permanency of that title once the affectio has ceased remains unexplained. It is not clear how – and especially why - the above-mentioned title, by then no longer existing, could then be enforced against the (<b>third)</b> <b>holder,</b> compared to whom the cohabitee is an irrelevant legal entity for the purposes of possession. There is the risk of creating an unnatural connection between the ratio of the protection of possession and the need, which is certainly legitimate, to safeguard the cohabitee...|$|E
