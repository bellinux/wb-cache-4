50|$|A {{candidate}} gene is {{a gene that}} is suspected to cause a disease or disorder. In KWE, this gene {{is known to be}} located in the area between chromosome 8q22 and 8q23. Within this region, the occurrence of loss of heterozygosity (simultaneous loss of function in both alleles of a gene) has been associated with malignancy, including certain types of breast and lung cancer. During the investigation for a KWE {{candidate gene}} in this same region, twelve protein transcripts were evaluated between microsatellite markers D8S550 and D8S1759, which is a critical area shown to be the source of KWE pathogenesis. Among the twelve transcripts identified, one corresponded to the BLK gene, which encodes the enzyme B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase. Four other of these transcripts included a myotubularin (MTMR8), a potential human homologue of the mouse Amac1 enzyme, a transcript similar to the mouse L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase gene, and one similar to a human oncogene. The remaining seven transcripts did not resemble any currently known genes. In all, none of the twelve transcripts displayed any evidence of pathogenic involvement with KWE. As a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map</b> of this critical area is being drawn, based on microsatellite identification, haplotype analysis and other measures; localization of the gene associated with KWE pathogenesis is an ongoing process.|$|E

40|$|We have mapped {{the genes}} coding for two major {{structural}} polypeptides of the vaccinia virus core by hybrid selection and <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mapping.</b> First, RNA {{was selected by}} hybridization to restriction fragments of the vaccinia virus genome, translated in vitro and the products were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the two polypeptides. This approach allowed us to map the genes to the left hand end of the largest Hind III restriction fragment of 50 kilobase pairs. Second, <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mapping</b> of this {{region of the genome}} revealed the presence of the two expected RNAs. Both RNAs are transcribed from the leftward reading strand and the 5 '-ends of the genes are separated by about 7. 5 kilobase pairs of DNA.

40|$|Abstract Background Proteins {{that are}} {{involved}} in regulation of cell division and cell cycle progression remain undefined in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, there is a growing appreciation that regulation of cell replication at the point of division is important in establishing a non-replicating persistent state. Accordingly, the objective {{of this study was to}} use a systematic approach consisting of consensus-modeling bioinformatics, ultrastructural analysis, and <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mapping</b> to identify septum regulatory proteins that participate in adaptive metabolic responses in M. tuberculosis. Results Septum site determining protein (Ssd), encoded by rv 3660 c was discovered to be an ortholog of septum site regulating proteins in actinobacteria by bioinformatics analysis. Increased expression of ssd in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis inhibited septum formation resulting in elongated cells devoid of septa. <b>Transcriptional</b> <b>mapping</b> in M. tuberculosis showed that increased ssd expression elicited a unique response including the dormancy regulon and alternative sigma factors that are thought to play a role in adaptive metabolism. Disruption of rv 3660 c by transposon insertion negated the unique transcriptional response and led to a reduced bacterial length. Conclusions This study establishes the first connection between a septum regulatory protein and induction of alternative metabolism consisting of alternative sigma factors and the dormancy regulon that is associated with establishing a non-replicating persistent intracellular lifestyle. The identification of a regulatory component involved in cell cycle regulation linked to the dormancy response, whether directly or indirectly, provides a foundation for additional studies and furthers our understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in establishing a non-replicating state and resumption of growth. </p...|$|R

Both were non-methylated, G + C rich, and contained CpG {{at close to}} the expected frequency. When used as probes, the two islands detected multiple transcripts in RNA from several mouse tissues. Cloned cDNAs for the major transcripts of one island (HTF 9) were isolated and used to construct a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map.</b> We found that HTF 9 contains the origin {{of a pair of}} divergent transcripts that are probably messenger RNAs. The bidirectional promoter is different from those previously observed as the major transcription start sites for each orientation are coincident on opposite strands of the DNA. The results support the view that HTF islands often mark genes, and they suggest that bidirectional transcription may be a common feature of island promoters...|$|E
40|$|We {{constructed}} a complete <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map</b> of the 218 kb Brassica campestris (turnip) mitochondrial genome.

In addition, a number of less abundant transcripts, many of which overlap {{with each other and}} with the major transcripts, were also detected. If each abundant transcript represents a distinct rRNA or protein species, then plant mitochondria would appear to encode a significantly larger number of proteins than do animal mitochondria. Although B. campestris mitochondrial DNA contains a number of chloroplast DNA-derived sequences, none of these chloroplast sequences appear to be transcribed within the mitochondrion.

A detailed long-range restriction map provided a framework for the cosmid contig assembly and further refines existing physical mapping data. We have used a combined approach towards {{the isolation of the}} genes housed within these cosmids.

40|$|SummaryMouse {{studies have}} been {{instrumental}} in forming our current understanding of early cell-lineage decisions; however, similar insights into the early human development are severely limited. Here, we present a comprehensive <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map</b> of human embryo development, including the sequenced transcriptomes of 1, 529 individual cells from 88 human preimplantation embryos. These data show that cells undergo an intermediate state of co-expression of lineage-specific genes, followed by a concurrent establishment of the trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm lineages, which coincide with blastocyst formation. Female cells of all three lineages achieve dosage compensation of X chromosome RNA levels prior to implantation. However, {{in contrast to the}} mouse, XIST is transcribed from both alleles throughout the progression of this expression dampening, and X chromosome genes maintain biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds.

We also identified intrinsic differences between the HPV 6 b-associated condyloma transcript map and that of the HPV 16 -associated low grade CIN specifically regarding promoter usage.

Two nonoverlapping genes, extending in opposite directions and encoding polypeptides with molecular weights of 35, 000 and 94, 000 (35 K and 94 K polypeptides), were identified. Unspliced, messenger-active RNAs were transcribed from both genes early (2 h) after infection. Indicative of immediate-early genes, transcription of the divergent RNAs was unaffected by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Late in infection, abundant RNAs were transcribed from promoters located at least 2. 5 kilobase pairs upstream from the gene encoding the 35 K polypeptide.

By unraveling the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map</b> of the ∼ 280 kb ФKZ genome to single-nucleotide resolution, we combine 369 ФKZ genes into 134 operons. Early transcription is initiated from highly conserved AT-rich promoters distributed across the ФKZ genome and located on the same strand of the genome. Early transcription does not require phage or host protein synthesis. Transcription of middle and late genes is dependent on protein synthesis and mediated by poorly conserved middle and late promoters. Unique to ФKZ {{is its ability to}} complete its infection in the absence of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) enzyme activity. We propose that transcription of the ФKZ genome is performed by the consecutive action of two ФKZ-encoded, non-canonical multisubunit RNAPs, one of which is packed within the virion, another being the product of early genes.

40|$|An {{experimental}} system, {{called the}} elimination test (Et), {{was developed to}} identify tumor growth antagonizing genes. Chromosome 3 containing microcell hybrids (MCHs) were passaged through SCID mice and regular deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3 p) were found by cytogenetic and molecular methods. The Et focused on 3 p due to its frequent deletion in 23 tumor types including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and breast cancer. By {{increasing the number of}} the tumors and by marker enrichment in the region of interest the common eliminated region I (CER 1 or C 3 CER 1) was reduced gradually to 1. 6 cM on 3 p 21. 3. Our aim was to further decrease the size of C 3 CER 1 and identify the gene content. Additional markers were selected to further study the panel of MCH derived SCID tumors. We reduced C 3 CER 1 to approximately 1 Mb and covered it with a PAC contig. Fiber-FISH was performed with PAC clones to assess the integrity of our contig. From the telomeric part of C 3 CER 1 two overlapping PACs were selected for sequencing. We identified a novel LIM domain containing gene, which we named to LIM domain containing 1 (LIMD 1). We have characterized and mapped the mouse ortholog (Limd 1) of the human gene. They both contain three tandemly arrayed LIM domains at their C-terminal ends. As the continuation of the gene identification in C 3 CER 1, we constructed a physical and <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map</b> of a 250 kb region, which included four additional genes (LZTFL 1, KIAA 0851 /SAC 1, XT 3, CCR 9). We characterized a novel leucine zipper containing gene, the Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor- Like 1 (LZTFL 1) and its mouse ortholog (Lztfl 1). The LZTFL 1 gene has two isoforms displaying alternative polyadenylation. The further detailed description of the transcriptional content of the C 3 CER 1 was possible due to further sequencing of eleven PAC clones and the appearance of new sequences in the public database. We assembled all the available data and detected 19 genes and 3 processed pseudogenes whithin a 1. 4 Mb comprehensive <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map.</b> We identified and characterized four novel genes: FYVE and coiled-coil domain containing 1 (FYCO 1), Transmembrane protein 7 (TMEM 7), Leucine-rich repeat-containing 2 (LARRC 2), Leucine Zipper Protein 3 gene (LUZP 3). The refined centromeric border of C 3 CER 1 is located inside the LRRC 2 gene. A chemokine receptor cluster was recognized within C 3 CER 1, which consisted of 8 genes. The availability of the mouse sequence from Celera database made it possible to apply a comparative study to further investigate C 3 CER 1 A 1. 32 -Mb human genomic sequence was compared with its 907 -kb mouse orthologous sequence. The corresponding mouse region was found divided into two blocks, but their gene content and gene positions were highly conserved between human and mouse. We observed that two orthologous mouse genes (Xtrp 3 s 1 and Cmkbr 1) were duplicated. We also recognized a large number of conserved elements that were neither exons of known genes, CpG islands, nor repeats. We further identified and characterized five novel orthologous mouse genes (Kiaa 0028, Xtrp 3 s 1, Fyco 1, Tmem 7, and Lrrc 2). The murine/human conservation breakpoint region (CBR) has features that characterize unstable chromosomal regions: deletions in YAC clones, late replication, gene and segment duplications, pseudogene insertions. The detailed <b>transcriptional</b> <b>map</b> of C 3 CER 1 was prerequisite for the delineation of its role in tumorigenesis. We found 18 genes within C 3 CER 1, which will be studied further.

A polypeptide of 65, 000 molecular weight produced in reticulocyte lysates programmed with viral mRNA isolated late in infection was identified as L 65 by peptide mapping. L 65 mRNA was purified by hybridization selection to restriction fragments of the viral genome and translated in vitro. This allowed the gene encoding L 65 to be mapped to the rightmost 4. 5 kilobase pairs of the HindIII D fragment. <b>Transcriptional</b> <b>mapping</b> of this region of the genome detected a late mRNA which was initiated at 450 base pairs {{to the right of the}} HindIII D-A junction, was transcribed in the leftward direction, and was terminated in the nondescript manner typical of vaccinia virus late mRNAs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing a {{transient}} complementation assay for DNA replication of an origin-containing reporter plasmid, a 2. 4 -kb region (m. u. 48. 3 - 50. 1) of the Orgyia pseudotsugata multinucleocapsid {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (OpMNPV) genome was identified that contains a gene essential for OpMNPV DNA replication. This region was sequenced and open reading frames were identified. Replication assays using subclones from this region identified a gene called late expression factor 3 (lef- 3), as the essential replication gene. <b>Transcriptional</b> <b>mapping</b> using both Northern blot and S 1 nuclease protection assays demonstrated that lef- 3 was expressed as an early gene with a major transcript of 1. 7 kb in length OpMNPV lef- 3 encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 42. 6 kDa (373 amino acids) and exhibits 41 % amino acid sequence identity with its homolog in the genome of the Autographa californica MNPV. A pattern of amino acids similar to that found in single-stranded DNA binding proteins {{is present in the}} amino-terminus of both OpMNPV and AcMNPV LEF- 3...|$|R
40|$|We have {{characterized}} a cDNA and {{the corresponding}} gene for a cyclic AMP-inducible gene expressed during Dictyostelium development. This gene, BP 74, {{was found to be}} first expressed about the time of aggregate formation, approximately 6 h after starvation. Accumulation of BP 74 mRNA did not occur in Dictyostelium cells that had been starved in fast-shaken suspension cultures but was induced in similar cultures to which cyclic AMP pulses had been added. The BP 74 cDNA and gene were characterized by DNA sequence analysis and <b>transcriptional</b> <b>mapping.</b> When the BP 74 promoter region was fused with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and reintroduced into Dictyostelium cells, the transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene displayed the same developmentally regulated pattern of expression as did the endogenous BP 74 gene, suggesting that all of the cis-acting elements required for regulated expression were carried by a 2 -kilobase cloned genomic fragment. On the basis of sequence analysis, the gene appeared to encode a protein containing a 20 -residue hydrophobic sequence at the amino-terminal end and 26 copies of a 20 -amino-acid repeat...|$|R
