40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} effects of chondroitin sulfate (ACS, a {{glycosaminoglycan}} of cartilage) with and without interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) on human articular chondrocytes cultivated in clusters and in long-term (0 - 16 days or 16 - 32 days). DESIGN: Chondrocyte productions of proteoglycans (PGs), type II collagen (coll-II) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) were assayed by specific radioimmunoassays applied to conditioned culture media and to clusters. RESULTS: During the two culture periods (0 - 16 days or 16 - 32 days), ACS (100 - 1000 micrograms/ml) increased <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> production and {{had no effect on}} the production of coll-II by chondrocytes. During the first 16 days, ACS (500 - 1000 micrograms/ml) decreased total PGE 2 synthesis. IL- 1 beta decreased PG and coll-II productions and increased PGE 2 synthesis. During the first period (0 - 16 days), while the cluster is forming, ACS counteracted the IL- 1 beta-induced effects on PG (500 - 1000 micrograms ACS/ml), coll-II (100 - 1000 micrograms ACS/ml) and PGE 2 (500 - 1000 micrograms ACS/ml) productions. During the second period (16 - 32 days), when the cluster is already formed, ACS counteracted the IL- 1 beta-induced effects on <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> (100 - 1000 micrograms ACS/ml), coll-II (1000 micrograms ACS/ml) and PGE 2 (1000 micrograms ACS/ml) productions. CONCLUSION: These in vitro studies suggest that ACS is able to increase matrix component production by human chondrocytes and to inhibit the negative effects of IL- 1 beta. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of the {{inactivation}} of pectinolytic enzymes (PME and PG) of Cherry tomato juice under high pressure (0. 1 - 800 MPa) and moderate temperature conditions (40 - 80 °C) was conducted. In addition, the effect of selected HHP processing conditions on quality parameters, such as color, lycopene content and viscosity of tomato juice was studied. PME and PG inactivation followed first order kinetics at all conditions tested. Pressure and temperature acted antagonistically as far as PME inactivation is concerned, while they had a synergistic effect in most pressure-temperature combinations on PG inactivation. A slight increase in red color and lycopene content of tomato juice after high pressure processing was observed.

This applied to both types of polysaccharide chains found in PGs, namely the galactosaminoglycuronans (GalN-GAGs) and the glucosaminoglycuronans (GlcN-GAGs).

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} {{was used to}} quantify phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecular species in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from control and mild asthmatic subjects after local allergen challenge. BALF was obtained from 5 control and 13 asthmatic subjects before and 24 h after segmental allergen and saline challenge. There were no differences in the ratio of total PC to <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> or in the molecular species composition of PC or PG between the asthmatic and control groups under basal conditions. Allergen challenge in asthmatic but not in control volunteers caused {{a significant increase in}} the PC-to-PG ratio because of increased concentrations of PC species containing linoleic acid (16 : 0 / 18 : 2 PC, 18 : 0 / 18 : 2 PC, and 18 : 1 / 18 : 2 PC). These molecular species were characteristic of plasma PC analyzed from the same subjects, strongly suggesting that the altered PC composition in BALF in asthmatic subjects after allergen challenge was due to infiltration of plasma lipoprotein, not to catabolism of surfactant phospholipid. Interactions between surfactant and lipoprotein infiltrate may contribute to surfactant dysfunction and potentiate disease severity in asthma...|$|E
40|$|Cyclooxygenase is {{the enzyme}} {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} prostaglandins (PGs). This cyclooxygenaseexists in two isoforms: cyclooxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) and cyclooxygense- 2 (COX- 2). In humans and primateshigh levels of COX- 2 are detected in the seminal vesicle. Further, the main source of PGs in the semen ofthese species is from the seminal vesicle. In rodents, the source of PGs in semen is from the vas deferens andabundant levels of COX- 2 are detected. A direct relation is thought to exist between COX- 2 levels and thesource of PGs in semen. Moreover, the role of COX- 1 and COX- 2 in the seminal vesicle of rodents isobscure. The present study aims at localizing COX- 1 and COX- 2 in the seminal vesicle of mice. Immunohistochemical staining and COX activity assay revealed COX- 1 as a dominant isoform in the mouseseminal vesicle.

40|$|Peptidoglycan (PG) {{composition}} in intact cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its isogenic Femmu-tants {{has been characterized}} by measuring the glycine content of PG bridge structures by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The glycine content estimated from integrated intensities (rather than peak heights) in the cell walls of whole cells was increased by approximately 30 % for the FemAmutant and was reduced by 25 % for the FemBmutant relative to expected values for homogeneous structures. In contrast, the expected compositions were observed in isolated cell walls of the samemutants. For FemAmutant whole cells, the increase {{was due to the}} presence of triglycyl bridge PG units (confirmed directly by mass spec-trometric analysis), which constituted 10 % of the <b>total</b> <b>PG.</b> These species were coalesced in some sort of a lattice or aggregate with spatial proximity to other PG bridges. This result suggests that the triglycyl-bridged PG units form a PG-like structure that is not incorporated into the mature cell wall. Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the bacterialcell wall whose biosynthesis is targeted by several classes of antibiotics, including-lactams (1, 2) and glycopeptides (3 – 5).

In this study, we examined the concentration and localization of PGs in advanced (stage IV) laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and compared with human normal larynx (HNL). LSCC and HNL sections were examined immunohistochemically with a panel of antibodies, and tissues extracts were analyzed by biochemical methods including immunoblotting and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results demonstrated significant destruction of cartilage in LSCC, which was followed by marked decrease of aggrecan and link protein. In contrast {{to the loss of}} aggrecan in LSCC, accumulation of versican and decorin was observed in the tumor-associated stroma. Biochemical analyses indicated that aggrecan, versican, decorin and biglycan comprise the vast majority of <b>total</b> <b>PGs</b> in both healthy and cancerous tissue. In LSCC the absolute amounts of KS/CS/DS-containing PGs were dramatically decreased about 18 -fold in comparison to HNL. This decrease is due to the loss of aggrecan. Disaccharide analysis of CS/DSPGs from LSCC showed a significant reduction of 6 -sulfated Δ-disaccharides (Δdi- 6 S) with a parallel increase of 4 -sulfated Δ-disaccharides (Δdi- 4 S) as compared to HNL. The obtained data clearly demonstrate that tumor progression is closely related to specific alteration of matrix PGs in LSCC. The altered composition of PGs in cartilage, as well as in tumor-associated stroma, is crucial for the biological behaviour of cancer cells in the diseased tissue...|$|R

The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority conducted a series of measurements examining the contamination and the results are reported in this paper. Results: Earlier inspection of the waste incinerator had shown dioxin levels in fly ash of 2. 1 ng I-TEQ/m 3, which exceeded the EU maximum limit of 0. 1 ng I-TEQ/m 3. Late in 2010 routine inspection found 4. 0 pg WHO-TEQ/g for PCDD/Fs and 7. 4 <b>pg</b> <b>total</b> WHO-TEQ/g fat in one milk sample from a farm in Engidalur; levels exceeding the EU maximum limits of 3. 0 and 6. 0 pg WHO-TEQ/fat for dairy fat, respectively.

[3 H]Thymidine uptake was measured in chondrocyte clusters, and specific PG and coll II RIAs were performed every 4 days on the culture medium and cell aggregates; <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> and coll II production were also assessed at different culture durations by adding the amounts found in culture media and their corresponding clusters. Incubation with hCT or sCT did not affect [3 H]thymidine uptake regardless of the dose. For each culture period, PG and coll II release into culture medium, cluster content, and total production increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Cumulative curves for these parameters showed a progressive significant increase with culture duration at hCT and sCT doses of 0, 5, and 10 ng/mL. Cumulative curves obtained with 10, 100, and 1000 ng/mL were seldom significantly different from one another. No differences emerged {{between the use of}} hCT or sCT. Thus, CT exerted no proliferative effect on human articular chondrocytes in tridimensional culture, but displayed a dose-dependent and prolonged stimulatory effect on PG and coll II production.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} time-dependent changes in pepsinogen (PG) synthesis of porcine gastric chief cells during long-term monolayer culture. Porcine chief cells were isolated by pronase/collagenase treatment of fundic mucosa and enriched by density gradient and counterflow centrifugation. PG isoenzymes were identified in [l- 35 S]methionine-labelled cultured chief cells by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by phosphor imager analysis, protease detection and immunoblots with specific PG A and C antibodies. The obtained results suggest that porcine chief cell cultures, after an initial settling period, reached an approximate steady state in total protein content and synthesis as well as in PG content and isoenzyme pattern from days 3 to 9 of culture. The latter was characterized by the presence of at least two PG A and two PG C isoenzymes. During the supposed steady-state <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> synthesis averaged out at 34 ± 2 % of total protein synthesis, as detected by [l- 35 S]methionine incorporation, due to the synthesis of, mainly, PG A 2 and, to a much lesser extent, PG C and A 1. In line with an active secretion, PG A 2 proportion was on average significantly higher in released (44 ± 3 %) than in intracellular labelled proteins (19 ± 2 %). In addition, PG release from chief cells cultured for 6 and 9 days could be stimulated by cholecystokinin-octapeptide. These data suggest that porcine chief cells in monolayer culture are a model well suited for the quantitative and qualitative characterization of PG isoenzyme synthesis and release during long-term investigations, for which an establishment of a culture steady state appears to be a useful prerequisite...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn an {{accompanying}} manuscript, {{it was shown}} that the cartilage chondrolytic activities of fibronectin fragments (Fn-f), which are mediated through catabolic cytokines such as TNF-α, IL- 1 and IL- 6, could be suppressed by anti-oxidants (AOs). The AOs neutralized reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are known to mediate catabolic cytokine action. The objective in this work was to test whether AOs would promote restoration of proteoglycan (PG) in Fn-f treated cartilage, since under normal culturing conditions, PG is not restored after removal of the Fn-f. Cartilage was first cultured with an amino-terminal 29 -kDa Fn-f to cause loss of {{about half of the}} <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> and then treated with NAC (1 and 10 mM) or glutathione (10 μM) or DMSO (0. 1 or 1 %). Treatment with NAC and glutathione maximally caused restoration of PG within 14 days to normal or supernormal levels, while DMSO was less effective. Catalase, but not superoxide dismutase, enhanced PG content to a small but significant extent. The restoration of PG in Fn-f treated cartilage occurred throughout the full depth of the cartilage slices as shown by histochemical analysis. However, removal of the AO allowed a subsequent decrease in PG content suggesting that the AOs had not blocked cytokine expression but had merely suppressed cytokine activities. Addition of NAC to IL- 1 treated cartilage promoted a restoration of PG, while addition to chymopapain or trypsin treated cartilage was not very effective, suggesting that the effect of AOs requires a cytokine driven damage system. We conclude that the AOs promote a restoration of PG in the Fn-f treated cartilage by suppressing the effects of catabolic cytokines. The data suggest a potential for AOs in reversing tissue damage caused by cytokines...|$|E

40|$|The {{strawberry}} (Fragaria × ananassa ‘Chandler’) fruit {{undergoes a}} fast softening during ripening. Polygalacturonase (PG) activity is low during this process, but two ripening-related PG genes, FaPG 1 and FaPG 2, have been cloned. Both genes were up-regulated during fruit ripening and were also negatively regulated by auxin. To further assess {{the role of}} FaPG 1 on strawberry softening, transgenic plants containing an antisense sequence of this gene {{under the control of}} the 35 S promoter (APG lines) were obtained. Sixteen out of 30 independent transgenic lines showed fruit yields similar to those of the control. Several quality parameters were measured in ripe fruits from these 16 lines. Fruit weight was slightly reduced in four lines, and most of them showed an increase in soluble solid content. Half of these lines yielded fruits significantly firmer than did the control. Four APG lines were selected, their ripened fruits being on average 163 % firmer than the control. The postharvest softening of APG fruits was also diminished. Ripened fruits from the four selected lines showed a 90 % to 95 % decrease in FaPG 1 transcript abundance, whereas the level of FaPG 2 was not significantly altered. <b>Total</b> <b>PG</b> activity was reduced in three of these lines when compared with control fruits. Cell wall extracts from APG fruits showed a reduction in pectin solubilization and an increase in pectins covalently bound to the cell wall. A comparative transcriptomic analysis of gene expression between the ripened receptacle of the control and those of the APG fruits (comprising 1, 250 receptacle expressed sequence tags) did not show any statistically significant change. These results indicate that FaPG 1 plays a central role in strawberry softening...|$|E
40|$|The loss of {{firm texture}} {{is one of}} the most {{characteristic}} physiological processes that occur during the ripening of fleshy fruits. It is generally accepted that the disassembly of primary cell wall and middle lamella is the main factor involved in fruit softening. In this process, polygalacturonase (PG) has been implicated in the degradation of the polyuronide network in several fruits. However, the minor effect of PG downregulation on tomato softening, reported during the nineties, minimized the role of this enzyme in softening. Further works in other fruits are challenging this general assumption, as is occurring in strawberry. The strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit undergoes an extensive and fast softening that limit its shelf life and postharvest. Traditionally, it has also been considered that PG plays a minor role on this process, due to the low PG activity found in ripened strawberry fruits. Transgenic strawberry plants expressing an antisense sequence of the ripening-specific PG gene FaPG 1 have been generated to get an insight into the role of this gene in softening. Half of the transgenic lines analyzed yielded fruits significantly firmer than control, without being affected other fruit parameters such as weight, color or soluble solids. The increase on firmness was maintained after several days of posharvest. In these firmer lines, FaPG 1 was silenced to 95 %, but <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> activity was only minor reduced. At the cell wall level, transgenic fruits contained a higher amount of covalently bound pectins whereas the soluble fraction was diminished. A microarray analysis of genes expressed in ripened receptacle did not show any significant change between control and transgenic fruits.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hydrostatic}} pressure on proteoglycan (PG) metabolism of chondrocyte cultures was examined using {{a specially designed}} test chamber. Primary cultures of bovine articular chondrocytes at confluence were exposed for 20 h to 5 and 30 MPa continuous hydrostatic pressures and 5 MPa hydrostatic pulses (0. 017, 0. 25 and 0. 5 Hz) {{in the presence of}} [35 S]sulphate. Northern blot analyses showed that chondrocyte cultures used in this study expressed abundant mRNA transcripts of aggrecan, typical of chondrocytes, but not versican. The cultures also expressed biglycan and decorin. Enzymic digestions with keratanase and chondroitinases AC, ABC and B and subsequent SDS/agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the synthesis of aggrecans and small dermatan sulphate PGs. The continuous 30 MPa pressure reduced <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> synthesis by 37 % as measured by [35 S]sulphate incorporation, in contrast to the 5 MPa continuous pressure which had no effect. The high static pressure also reduced total [3 H]glucosamine incorporation by 63 % and total [14 C]leucine incorporation by 57 %. The cyclic pressures showed a frequency-dependent stimulation (0. 5 Hz, 11 %) or inhibition (0. 017 Hz, - 17 %) of [35 S]sulphate incorporation. Aggrecans secreted under continuous 30 MPa pressure showed a retarded migration in 0. 75 % SDS/agarose gel electrophoresis and they also eluted earlier on Sephacryl S- 1000 gel filtration, indicative of a larger molecular size. The increased size was consistent with an increase of average glycosaminoglycan chain length as determined by Sephacryl S- 300 gel filtration. No change in aggrecan size was observed with the lower (5 MPa) static or cyclic pressures. Continuous 30 MPa hydrostatic pressure slightly reduced the steady-state mRNA level of aggrecan, in parallel with the decline in PG synthesis measured by [35 S]sulphate incorporation. The results demonstrated that high hydrostatic pressure could influence the synthesis of PGs, especially of aggrecans, in chondrocytes both at the transcriptional and translational/post-translational levels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{consensus}} profiling {{method was}} introduced to overcome the exaggerated stochastic effects associated with low copy number DNA typing. However, little empirical evidence has been provided which shows that a consensus profile, derived from dividing a sample into separate aliquots and including only alleles seen at least twice, gives the most informative profile, compared to a profile obtained by amplifying the entire low template DNA extract in one reaction. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the quality of consensus profiles compared to profiles obtained using the whole low template extract for amplification. Methods A <b>total</b> of 100 <b>pg</b> and 25 pg DNA samples were amplified with the PowerPlex® ESI 16 Kits using 30 or 34 PCR cycles. A <b>total</b> of 100 <b>pg</b> and 25 pg DNA samples were then divided into three aliquots for a 34 -cycle PCR and a consensus profile derived that included alleles that appeared {{in at least two}} of the replicates. Profiles from the non-split samples were compared to the consensus profiles focusing on peak heights, allele drop out, locus drop out and allele drop in. Results Performing DNA profiling on non-split extracts produced profiles with a higher percentage of correct loci compared to the consensus profiling technique. Consensus profiling did eliminate any spurious alleles from the final profile. However, there was a notable increase in allele and locus drop out when a LTDNA sample was divided prior to amplification. Conclusions The loss of information that occurs when a sample is split for amplification indicates that consensus profiling may not be producing the most informative DNA profile for samples where the template amount is limited. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the application of High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) on quality attributes of tomato products. The effect of high hydrostatic pressure processing (0, 1 - 800 MPa, 40 - 80 °C) on the endogenous tomato enzymes, pectin methylestarase (PME) and polygalactouronase (PG), was kinetically studied, using three different tomato varieties: Cherrelino and two industrial hybrids namely Oval Red and Red Sea. For Cherrelino variety, the decrease of enzyme activity during thermal and pressure inactivation for both PME and PG followed first-order kinetics. PME {{was found to be}} pressure-stable while an antagonistic effect of pressure and temperature was observed. On the contrary, PG was more pressure sensitive than PME. PG inactivation rate constant increased with increasing pressure at all temperatures tested indicating a synergistic effect of pressure and temperature. HHP processing at selected processing conditions, did not significantly affect the color and lycopene content of tomato juice, while allowing <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> inactivation with concurrent remaining PME activity leading to high quality products in terms of viscosity and textural properties. PG inactivation for Oval Red and Red Sea, in both thermal and high pressure processing, deviated from 1 st order kinetics and was described by an nth order model. PG was found to be thermotolerant. Red Sea PG was found to be more temperature sensitive than Oval Red PG. On the other hand PG activity was extremely sensitive when thermal treatment was combined with pressure. PME inactivation, for both tomato varieties, followed first order kinetics in all tested process conditions. Red Sea PME inactivation was more temperature sensitive than the PME in Oval Red tomato juice. However, PME was found to be extremely pressure stable, indicating an antagonistic effect of pressure and temperature. Quality characteristics of slightly concentrated tomato juice produced from Red Sea tomatoes processed at selected HHP conditions were evaluated. Cold break treatment and high pressure processing did not affect the color of tomato juice, while during hot break a color deterioration was observed. Pressure treatment led to products of higher viscosity. Increase in applied pressure resulted in an increase in product viscosity and improved consistency. According to the overall results, HHP could be used to replace the traditional industrial tomato processing leading to products with superior quality characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{highlight}} the relationships between decorin, tenascin-X and type XIV collagen, three minor molecules of extracellular matrix (ECM), with some structural parameters of connective tissue and its content in total collagen, its cross-links (CLs) and its proteoglycans (PGs). In addition, we have evaluated impact of these minor molecules on beef quality traits. The relative abundance of these molecules was evaluated by western blot analysis in Longissimus thoracis (LT) and Biceps femoris (BF) muscles from Aberdeen Angus and Blond d'Aquitaine beef breeds. Decorin and tenascin-X were more abundant in BF than in LT (1. 8 v. 0. 5 arbitrary units (AU), respectively, P< 0. 001, and 1. 0 v. 0. 6 AU, P< 0. 05). There was no muscle effect for collagen XIV content. Decorin and tenascin-X relative abundance were positively correlated with perimysium and endomysium areas and with collagen characteristics (total, insoluble and CLs). Decorin was negatively correlated with <b>total</b> <b>PG</b> content and positively with tenascin-X. Collagen XIV was correlated with any of parameters measured. To assess the impact of decorin, tenascin-X and collagen XIV and of their ratios to total collagen and PGs on shear force and quality traits we realized, respectively, a multiple-linear regression analysis and a Pearson's correlation analysis. Decorin and tenascin-X relative abundance were, respectively, negatively and positively involved in juiciness. Decorin relative abundance was also negatively involved in abnormal flavour and positively in overall liking. The ratio of decorin to total collagen and PGs was negatively correlated to juiciness, together with collagen XIV ratio to total PGs. The ratios of decorin, tenascin-X and collagen XIV to total PGs were positively correlated to sensory tenderness, negatively to abnormal beef flavour and positively to overall liking. The ratio of decorin to total collagen was also negatively correlated to abnormal flavour and positively to overall liking while its ratio to total PGs was positively correlated to beef flavour and overall liking. Results of the present study highlighted for the first time the possible role of minor ECM molecules on beef quality traits. In addition, variations of meat texture and more generally of sensory qualities would depend not only to the quantity of total collagen and of its CLs, but also of components of ECM such as decorin, tenascin-X and collagen XIV and of their ratios to total collagen and PGs...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first results from our spectroscopic survey 1 of the environments of strong {{gravitational}} lenses. The lens galaxy {{belongs to a}} poor group of galaxies in six of the eight systems in our sample. We discover three new groups associated with the lens galaxies of BRI 0952 − 0115 (five members), MG 1654 + 1346 (seven members), and B 2114 + 022 (five members). We {{more than double the}} number of members for another three previously known groups around the lenses MG 0751 + 2716 (13 <b>total</b> members), <b>PG</b> 1115 + 080 (13 total members), and B 1422 + 231 (16 total members). We determine the kinematics of the six groups, including their mean velocities, velocity dispersions, and projected spatial centroids. For the newly discovered groups, we quantify these properties for the first time. For the other three groups, the increased membership allows us to make more robust estimates of the kinematic properties of the groups than previously possible. The velocity dispersions of the groups range from 110 + 170 − 80 to 470 + 100 − 90 km s− 1. The higher velocity dispersions (for the richer groups MG 0751, PG 1115, and B 1422) are consistent with those of nearby X-ray luminous groups, while th...|$|R

Several Arabidopsis miRNA sequences were tested using SYBR ® Green reagent, demonstrating that this method, using as little as 100 <b>pg</b> <b>total</b> RNA, could readily discriminate the expression of miRNAs having as few as one nucleotide sequence difference.

40|$|Ultrasound imaging {{contrast}} {{agents that}} exhibit {{an affinity for}} specific tissue types, and especially, disease sites, would have considerable clinical value. Liposomal dispersions can be prepared such that they both reflect diagnostic ultrasound [1] and, when conjugated to an appropriate antibody, target themselves to thrombi in the vascular circulation [2]. The procedure for preparation of ultrasound-reflective liposomes, consisting of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cholesterol (CH), requires sonication to hydrate the lipid thoroughly, addition of an excipient, lyophilization, and reconstitution. These steps were examined to generate an optimal preparation [3]. Ultrasound reflectivity was assessed using a 20 MHz intravascular ultrasound catheter and computerassisted videodensitometry. Ultrasound reflectivity {{was found to be}} maximal at a CH concentration of 10 mol %.

40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Cochliobolus carbonum produces endo-α 1, 4 -polygalacturonase (endoPG), exo-α 1, 4 -polygalacturonase (exoPG), and pectin methylesterase when grown in culture on pectin. Residual activity in a pgn 1 mutant (lacking endoPG) {{was due to}} exoPG activity, and the responsible protein has now been purified. After chemical deglycosylation, the molecular mass of the purified protein decreased from greater than 60 to 45 kDa. The gene that encodes exoPG, PGX 1, was isolated with PCR primers based on peptide sequences from the protein. The product of PGX 1, Pgx 1 p, has a predicted molecular mass of 48 kDa, 12 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 61 % amino acid identity to an exoPG from the saprophytic fungus Aspergillus tubingensis. Strains of C. carbonum mutated in PGX 1 were constructed by targeted gene disruption and by gene replacement. Growth of pgx 1 mutant strains on pectin was reduced by ca. 20 %, and they were still pathogenic on maize. A double pgn 1 /pgx 1 mutant strain was constructed by crossing. The double mutant grew {{as well as the}} pgx 1 single mutant on pectin and was still pathogenic despite having less than 1 % of <b>total</b> wild-type <b>PG</b> activity. Double mutants retained a small amount of PG activity with the same cation-exchange retention time as Pgn 1 p and also pectin methylesterase and a PG activity associated with the mycelium.

40|$|Fish from Dutch {{markets were}} {{analysed}} for concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) and {{compared with the}} new European maximum residue levels (MRLs), set in 2006. In a first study on 11 different fish and shellfish from various locations, concentrations of PCDD/Fs were nearly all below the MRL for PCDD/Fs [4 pg toxic equivalents (TEQ) per gram wet weight (ww) ] and nearly all below 8 <b>pg</b> <b>total</b> TEQ/g ww, the new MRL for the sum of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs. Some samples exceeded the total TEQ MRL, such as anchovy, tuna and sea bass. Furthermore, 20 (out of 39) wild eel samples exceeded the specific MRL for eel (12 <b>pg</b> <b>total</b> TEQ/g ww), as the study revealed PCDD/F TEQ levels of 0. 2 - 7. 9 pg TEQ/g ww and total TEQ values of 0. 9 to 52 pg/g ww. TEQ levels in farmed and imported eel were lower and complied with the MRLs. Smoking eel, a popular tradition in the Netherlands, only had marginal effects on PCDD/F and DL-PCB concentrations. Owing to volatilization, concentrations of lower-chlorinated PCBs were reduced to below the limit of quantification after smoking. DL-PCBs contributed 61 - 97 % to the total TEQ in all eel samples. This also holds for other fish and shellfish (except shrimps) : DL-PCB contributed (on average) from 53 (herring) to 83 % (tuna) to the total TEQ. Principal-component analysis revealed distinctive congener profiles for PCDD/Fs and non-ortho PCBs for mussels, pikeperch, herring and various Mediterranean fish. The application of new TCDD toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) set by the World Health Organization in 2006 (to replace the 1997 TEFs) resulted in lower TEQ values, mainly owing to a decreased mono-ortho PCB contribution. This decrease is most pronounced for eel, owing to the relative high mono-ortho PCB concentrations in eel. Consequently, {{a larger number of}} samples would comply with the MRLs when the new TEFs are applied. The DR CALUX (R) assay may be used for screening total TEQ levels in eel, in combination with gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry confirmation of suspected samples. An almost 1 : 1 correlation was found when the 1997 TEFs were applied, but, surprisingly, a 1. 4 -fold overestimation occurred with application of the 2006 TEFs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective To {{determine}} whether glucosamine- 3 -sulfate, glucose- 3 -sulfate (control) and N-acetyl glucosamine inhibit experimentally induced degradation of equine articular cartilage explants similar to glucosamine HCl. Design Articular cartilage {{was obtained from}} the antebrachio-carpal and middle joints of horses (2 – 8 years old) killed for reasons unrelated to lameness. Cartilage discs were harvested from the weight-bearing region of the articular surface and cultured. Media were exchanged daily and the recovered media stored at 4 °C. On days 1 and 2 lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 μg/ml) was added to induce cartilage degradation. To evaluate the effects of different sources of glucosamine (on an equal molar basis), varying concentrations of glucosamine HCl (0. 25, 2. 5, or 25 mg/ml), glucosamine- 3 -sulfate (0. 304, 3. 04, or 30. 4 mg/ml), or N-acetyl-glucosamine (0. 256, 2. 56, or 25. 6 mg/ml) were added to the cultures. The glucose- 3 -sulfate control was added at 0. 3075, 3. 075 or 30. 75 mg/ml. Nitric oxide and proteoglycan released into conditioned media and tissue proteoglycan synthesis and <b>total</b> tissue <b>PG</b> content were measured as indicators of cartilage metabolism. Results Glucosamine- 3 -sulfate consistently inhibited cartilage degradation {{in a manner similar to}} glucosamine HCl, while the effects of N-acetyl-glucosamine were highly variable and did not inhibit cartilage degradation. Glucose- 3 -sulfate did not inhibit cartilage degradation. Conclusion Our results indicate that glucosamine sulfate also has the potential to prevent or reduce articular cartilage degradation similar to glucosamine HCl in vitro. The amine group at the carbon- 2 position appears important for the effectiveness of the glucosamine derivative. The therapeutic value of N-acetyl-glucosamine remains questionable...|$|R
40|$|For {{detecting}} Borna disease virus (BDV) genomic stranded RNA, single-tube reverse transcription-polymerase {{chain reaction}} (St RT-PCR) {{was developed to}} equal the sensitivity of RT-nested PCR but with reduced risk of contamination. BDV-genomic stranded RNA was synthesized in vitro using plasmid cDNA of BDV p 24 region as a template and RNA was also extracted from BDV-persistently infected MDCK (MDCK/BDV) cells. Both RNAs were amplified by St RT-PCR in which a single round of RT and a single round of PCR were performed in the same tube. Ten copies of synthesized RNA could be amplified by St RT-PCR, indicating that St RT-PCR method is as sensitive as the ordinary RT-nested PCR method. Furthermore, this method was applied to quantify the exact copy number of genomic RNA in MDCK/BDV cells.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether 17 ß-oestradiol (E 2) modulates interleukin (IL) 1 ß-induced proteoglycan degradation in chondrocytes, and to analyse the part played by metalloproteinases (MMPs) in this process. Methods: Primary cultured rabbit articular chondrocytes were prepared and treated with 10 ng/ml IL 1 ß combined or not with 0. 1 – 10 nM E 2. Neosynthesised proteoglycans (PGs) were evaluated after incorporation of [35 SO 4]sulphate and further analysed after chromatography on a Sepharose 2 B column. Chondrocyte mRNA levels of aggrecan, MMP- 1, - 3, - 13, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 (TIMP- 1) were studied by northern blot. MMP- 1 activity {{was measured by}} zymography. MMP- 1 gene transcription was studied by transient transfection of chondrocytes with an MMP- 1 -luciferase construct. Results: E 2 modulated the IL 1 ß-induced <b>total</b> sulphated <b>PGs</b> in rabbit articular chondrocytes, which decreased as the E 2 concentration was increased. At a low concentration (0. 1 nmol/l) E 2 counteracts the IL 1 ß-induced decrease in sulphated PG, while at high concentration (10 nmol/l) E 2 enhances the IL 1 ß effects. A biphasic E 2 effect was also observed on IL 1 ß-induced disaggregation of PG, 53 – 58 kDa gelatinolytic activity, and MMP- 1, - 3, and - 13 mRNA levels. In contrast, E 2 did not modify the level of aggrecan mRNA and {{had no effect on}} TIMP- 1 mRNA expression. Finally, simultaneous addition of IL 1 ß and E 2 (0. 1 – 10 nmol/l) did not modify IL 1 ß-induced MMP- 1 -luciferase activity, suggesting that E 2 effects probably occur at the post-transcriptional level of MMP gene expression. Conclusion: Oestrogen concentration may have an inverse effect on IL 1 ß stimulated proteoglycan degradation and MMP production by chondrocytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{changes that}} accompany tomato fruit ripening include increased solubilization and depolymerization of pectins {{due to the}} action of polygalacturonase (PG). Two PG isoenrymes can be extracted from ripe fruit: PG 2, which is a single catalytic PG polypeptide, and PG 1, which is composed of PG 2 tightly associated with a second noncatalytic protein, the p subunit. Previous studies have correlated ripening-associated increases in pectin solubilization and depo-lymerization {{with the presence of}} extractable PG 1 activity, prior to the appearance of PG 2, suggesting a functional role for the p subunit and PG 1 in pectin metabolism. To assess the function of the p subunit, we produced and characterized transgenic tomatoes constitutively expressing a p subunit antisense gene. Fruit from antisense lines had greatly reduced levels of p subunit mRNA and protein and accumulated < 1 % of their <b>total</b> extractable <b>PG</b> activity in ripe fruit as PG 1, as compared with 25 % for wild type. lnhibition of p subunit expression resulted i n significantly elevated levels of EDTA-soluble polyuronides at all stages of fruit ripening and a significantly higher degree of depolymerizationat later ripening stages. Decreased p subunit protein and extractable PG 1 enzyme activity and increased pectin solubility and depolymer-ization all cosegregated with the p subunit antisense transgene in T 2 progeny. These results indicate (1) that PG 2 is responsible for pectin solubilization and depolymerization in vivo and (2) that the p subunit protein is not required for PG 2 activity in vivo but (3) does {{play a significant role in}} regulating pectin metabolism in wild-type fruit by limiting the extent of pectin solubilization and depolymerization that can occur during ripening. Whether this occurs by direct inter-action of the p subunit with PG 2 or indirectly by interaction of the p subunit with the pectic substrate remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA {{commercial}} {{preparation of}} 800 -kDa hyaluronic acid (HA), (ARTZ from Seikagaku, Inc.), {{has been used}} as a therapeutic intervention in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). We tested the effect of this HA form, HA/ 800, in an in vitro cartilage chondrolytic system in which a specific amino-terminal 29 -kDa fragment of fibronectin (Fn-f) penetrates cartilage tissue to activate chondrocytes to amplify two major chondrolytic activities: suppression of proteoglycan (PG) synthesis and induction of matrix metalloproteinases. We report that HA/ 800 did not block damage by Fn-f in serum free cartilage cultures. However, HA/ 800 was effective in blocking the ability of 100 nm Fn-f to cause the degradation and release of half of the <b>total</b> cartilage <b>PG</b> from cartilage in 10 % serum/DMEM cultures. While the Fn-f caused a half-time for PG release of 3 days, continuous exposure to 0. 1 or 1 mg/ml HA/ 800 slowed the half-time to 12 days. Further, a single 1 day pre-incubation with 0. 1 or 1 mg/ml HA/ 800 was sufficient to decrease the half-time of 100 nm Fn-f mediated PG depletion to 7 and 12 days, respectively. HA/ 800 completely blocked the effect of 10 nm Fn-f. Blocking of Fn-f-mediated cartilage PG depletion was associated with a decreased concentration of Fn-f on the superficial cartilage surface and decreased penetration into the cultured cartilage tissue. Further, the two major chondrolytic activities of the Fn-f, suppression of synthesis of PG and enhanced release of stromelysin- 1, were suppressed by HA/ 800. HA/ 800 also partially restored PG in cartilage first damaged with the Fn-f. We conclude that HA/ 800 slows Fn-f-mediated cartilage chondrolysis in vitro and has some reparative potential. The damage blocking activity appears to be associated with the ability of HA/ 800 to block penetration of the Fn-f, rather than with direct effects on cartilage tissue...|$|R
