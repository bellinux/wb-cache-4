5|$|The initial {{limited edition}} release of Popotan on CD-ROM {{suffered}} critical errors, such as graphic display issues, saving and loading issues, <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> complete some routes and Mii's mini-game not starting.

5|$|By 1906, Irwin was {{manager of}} the Altoona Mountaineers in the Tri-State League. In July 1907, Irwin {{resigned}} as {{manager of the}} Mountaineers after fans became disgruntled. Even after entering baseball scouting, Irwin briefly managed the 1908 Washington club in the short-lived Union Professional League. The league was plagued by financial problems—including <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> pay players at times—and it folded {{less than two months}} after play began. He was rehired to the Penn coaching staff in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> save progress a drawback since gamers will {{have to play the}} entire game in one sitting if they wish to complete it.

5|$|Game Revolution {{said the}} {{multiplayer}} feature {{was a revelation}} and worth {{the cost of the}} game alone. Computer Games said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E
5|$|P.N.03 was {{developed}} {{on a tight}} schedule {{in an attempt to}} offset Capcom's poor fiscal year. However, the game received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Several critics found the game repetitive and unintuitive. They were divided on its gameplay mechanics: some disliked its controls—specifically <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> move and shoot simultaneously—while others compared it favorably to golden age arcade games. Mikami repurposed ideas from P.N.03 in his 2010 game Vanquish.|$|E

5|$|Phimosis is <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> retract the {{foreskin}} {{over the}} glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, {{and this is}} considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known turtles {{are from}} fossils in the Upper Triassic. These fossils are nearly indistinguishable from modern turtles anatomically. In these early fossils (mostly {{of the genus}} Proganochelys), the teeth have already been lost, and a keratin beak {{is suggested by the}} mandibles. Important differences between Proganochelys and modern turtles are the presence of the palatal teeth (lost in modern species), <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> retract the head within the shell, and the lack of a trochlear pulley in the jaw closing anatomy.|$|E
5|$|The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass {{to that of}} {{its host}} star has been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's {{characteristics}} are not as well-constrained, the planet's characteristics are not well-constrained either. <b>The</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's characteristics {{is a consequence of}} the fact that the star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.|$|E

5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E
