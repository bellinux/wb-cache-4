50|$|About 1838 Rendel {{dissolved}} his {{partnership with}} Beardmore at Plymouth, {{and settled in}} London, but still was chiefly employed on work for his native county. In 1841 he constructed the Millbay pier, Plymouth, a work of considerable difficulty owing to the depth of water {{in which it was}} built. Here he first introduced the method of construction since employed in Holyhead and Portland harbours. In 1839 he was engaged in preparing schemes for a railway between Exeter and Plymouth, running over Dartmoor. At the time sufficient funds could not be raised, but an alternative coast line was afterwards carried out by I. K. Brunel. In 1843 he made plans for docks at Birkenhead, which he defended before parliamentary committees against hostile local influence. The contest was long protracted, and the incessant labour served to shorten Rendel's life; his published evidence forms a valuable record of engineering practice of the period. In 1844-53 he constructed docks at Grimsby; in 1848-53 extensions of the docks at Leith; in 1850-53 docks at Garston on the Mersey, with extensions of the East and West India and the London docks. As constructor of the Grimsby docks {{he was one of the}} first to apply W. G. Armstrong's system of hydraulic machinery for working the lock gates, sluices, cranes, &c. For this work he received a grand medal of honour at the Paris Exhibition of 1855. For the admiralty he planned in 1845, and afterwards constructed, the packet and refuge harbour at Holyhead, and in 1847 he constructed the harbour of refuge at Portland. In the making of these great harbours he contrived, by means of elevated <b>timber</b> <b>staging,</b> to let down masses of stone vertically from railway trucks, and, by building up the masonry with unexampled rapidity to a point above sea level, contrived to reduce to comparative insignificance the force of the sea during building operations. As many as 24,000 tons (24 kt) of stone were deposited in one week. In 1850 he commenced making a new harbour at St. Peter Port, Guernsey.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{ever-increasing}} human impact through {{land use}} and climate change on the environment, we crucially need to achieve {{a better understanding of}} those factors that influence the questing activity of ixodid ticks, a major disease-transmitting vector in temperate forests. We investigated variation in the relative questing nymph densities of Ixodes ricinus in differently managed forest types for three years (2008 – 2010) in SW Germany by drag sampling. We used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach to examine the relative effects of habitat and weather and to consider possible nested structures of habitat and climate forces. The questing activity of nymphs was considerably larger in young forest successional stages of thicket compared with pole wood and <b>timber</b> <b>stages.</b> Questing nymph density increased markedly with milder winter temperatures. Generally, the relative strength of the various environmental forces on questing nymph density differed across years. In particular, winter temperature had a negative effect on tick activity across sites in 2008 in contrast to the overall effect of temperature across years. Our results suggest that forest management practices have important impacts on questing nymph density. Variable weather conditions, however, might override the effects of forest management practices on the fluctuations and dynamics of tick populations and activity over years, in particular, the preceding winter temperatures. Therefore, robust predictions and the detection of possible interactions and nested structures of habitat and climate forces can only be quantified through the collection of long-term data.

50|$|A 29.5 acre (11.94 hectare) Reserve for an Explosives Magazine (Portion 877A), located to {{the south}} of the Traveston railway station, was gazetted in April 1900.

An undated plan shows the three magazines arranged in a row, facing the railway line, with the brick magazine in the centre between the two timber magazines.

40|$|Eleven {{types of}} forest {{management}} were investigated (coniferous and deciduous age-class forest at pole-, young- and old <b>timber</b> <b>stage,</b> continuous cover forest management, selectively cut forest management, farmers’ forest, coppice, coppicewith- standards and unmanaged forest) {{with respect to}} ground-based measurements (diameter at breast height, stand density, tree height, wood volume, tree species composition, coarse woody debris, regeneration, deer browsing) and remotely sensed variables by LiDAR (e. g. canopy height, canopy surface area, canopy depth). Wood volume ranged between 320 m 3 ha- 1 in continuous cover forest and 730 m 3 ha- 1 in farmers’ forest. Basal area was between 25 m 2 ha- 1 in deciduous age-class forest and 49 m 2 ha- 1 in farmers’ forest. Coarse woody debris ranged between 11 m 3 ha- 1 in selectively cut forest and 39 m 3 ha- 1 in unmanaged forest. Number of tree species was lowest in the selectively cut forest (1 to 2 tree species per ha) and highest in coppice forest (up to 8 tree species per ha). Density of regeneration was independent of management, but damage due to deer browsing was highest in unmanaged forest reserves and in selectively cut forest, leading to a decline of admixed species. We found that a classification according to management types as based on management plans is not appropriate for scientific studies of relations between forest structure, biodiversity, and management at plot scale. In reality, some management types, such as continuous cover forest, were not sufficiently distinct. The most consistent separation was between longrotation, short-rotation and uneven-aged forests. The remotely sensed variables distinguished forest structures more clearly than ground-based measurements. Nevertheless, structural variables might be rather similar between unrelated management systems and rather dissimilar even within the same management type at plot scales between 500 m 2 and 0, 64 ha.

The double entry doors have an arched fanlight, and large single pane double-hung windows with arched heads to either side. Behind are two levels of offices and chambers each side of a central corridor.This northern section of the building has hipped roofs in a U-shaped configuration. There is a glazed lantern with curved domed roof on one of the ridges. The double-hung windows, smaller than those of the front, have two panes per sash and are shaded by continuous curved corrugated iron hoods. The walls are clad in weatherboards.The interior of this section has walls lined with wide horizontal beaded boards, and high ceilings of double beaded boards. The entry has the remnant of a gold painted sign beside the arched opening. The room beside the entry retains its moulded timber counter.

5000|$|One modern {{example is}} climate stability. [...] Classic {{examples}} of common goods are water and air. Water and air can be polluted: water flows can be tapped beyond sustainability, and air {{is often used}} in combustion, whether by motor vehicles, smokers, factories, wood fires. In the production process these resources and others are changed into finished products such as food, shoes, toys, furniture, cars, houses and televisions. Another example of a private exploitation treated as a renewable resource and commonly cited have been trees or <b>timber</b> at critical <b>stages</b> (used for wood and paper), oil (used for plastic, paints, foam, fabric, and often burned to create energy), mined metals (used to create machines, tools, nails, cans, coins), and crops (to become cotton and many kinds of foods). Fish stocks in international waters are also cited often. In this later example (avoiding any issues of the natural rights of the fish), while legal excluded from fishing may not apply, when fish are withdrawn from the water without any limits being imposed, living stocks of fish {{are likely to be}} depleted for any later fishermen. To describe situations in which economic users withdraw resources to secure short-term gains without regard for the long-term consequences, the term tragedy of the commons was coined. For example, forest exploitation leads to barren lands, and overfishing leads to a reduction of overall fish stocks, both of which eventually result in diminishing yields to be withdrawn periodically.|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{ensure that}} forest {{ecosystem}} {{services will be}} maintained in future climate conditions, the challenge of developing and implementing forest adaptation strategies has become a priority shared across Europe (European Commission 2010) {{and around the world}} (FAO 2012). A critical aspect of any adaptation (and mitigation) strategy is to ensure that management choices have sufficient flexibility and are consistent with sustainable forest management (SFM) principles that balance the forest’s social, ecological and economic outputs. Most current studies, however, still tend to consider forest adaptation independently of exogenous developments (Seppälä et al. 2009), or are based on forecasting and thus only extrapolate from current trends. Yet the futures of forest systems are also uncertain because change may come mainly from socio-economic, and not ecological, drivers (Schoene and Bernier 2012). Climate change will, moreover, have a highly uncertain effect on socio-ecological systems such as forests. A number of authors and international publications on the environment have posited that scenarios studies offer a framework for dealing with strong uncertainties and the complexity of socio-ecological systems: “Comparisons among a set of contrasting scenarios are used to understand the systemic interrelation and dynamics of complex socio-ecological systems and to define a range of possibilities and uncertainties in quantitative and qualitative terms” (Thompson et al. 2012). Likewise, SFM practices are beginning to underscore the importance of taking into account landscape-level views of the forest, and of the many exogenous drivers of regional change, when thinking about integrated land use (Schoene and Bernier 2012). Adaptation strategies must therefore move away from single technical solutions and must not rely on one-size-fits-all mechanisms. New modes of governance that enable rapidly accelerating social, economic and institutional changes are required (Seppälä et al. 2009). Recent emphasis has also been placed on the importance of implementing regionally based forest adaptation strategies that are accepted by local stakeholders (Spathelf et al. 2013). A scenario planning approach that engages stakeholders in scenario development could be a way to overcome such challenges by combining anticipatory learning of climate change impacts (Tschakert and Dietrich 2010) with land use planning. Thus, forest adaptation could be seen from a perspective of forest planning rather than of forest management. It could involve a more indirect form of management that is broader in scale in terms of time, space and organisational level (Mermet and Farcy 2011). The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss how a foresight approach and scenario planning can offer an appropriate framework for dealing with climate change uncertainties at local level, and for elaborating a plurality of forest adaptation strategies derived from plausible sectoral, socio-ecological and regional changes. To test this assumption, the Landes de Gascogne Forest (LGF) 2050 case study (Mora et al. 2012) appears particularly interesting, due both to recent storm damage in 1999 and 2009 and because of the increasing, diverse demands in changing economic and social conditions for various forest ecosystem goods and services. The Landes region of south-western France is located at the intersection of Northern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. It covers a surface area of about 15, 000 km 2. The major biophysical features of the area include temperate, oceanic climate conditions, podzolic sandy soils and shallow groundwater levels. The LGF, which was expanded in the nineteenth century to become the largest cultivated and privately owned (92 %) forest in Europe, is primarily composed of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). The LGF covers two thirds of the Landes de Gascogne region, with agricultural and built-up land representing 18 and 7 %, respectively (Mora et al. 2012). The forest also has a significant economic impact through its forestry and forest-based industries. A unique aspect of the Landes forest-wood chain is the location of both <b>timber</b> processing <b>stages</b> within the region and its largely exclusive use of local maritime pine wood resources. However, the forestry and forest-based sector have faced difficulties since the Martin and Klaus storms in 1999 and 2009 that created approximately 70 million cubic metres of windthrow damage. The forestry sector is also experiencing structural challenges as synergies among industry subsectors weaken and biorefinery activities gain prominence. Bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the large urban centres of Bordeaux to the north and Bayonne to the south (Fig. 1), the Landes area has become an increasingly popular place to live and to work. Almost all of the 390 municipalities in the region are now experiencing population growth, urbanisation, the emergence of a broader base of economic activity and, more generally, a diversification of their forest-derived goods and services. The contribution of forest-related activities to the rural economy and to social well-being may change as a result of these trends (Slee et al. 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|Notes: Includes: A. Natural decay {{resistance}} of wood [...] B. Laboratory evaluation of wood preservatives [...] C. Preservative tolerance of wood-destroying fungi© 1977 Dr. Edwin Warner Brandon Da CostaThe researches {{described in the}} attached papers followed a prolonged period of change and development. The initial purpose was to evaluate in the laboratory the probable durability of Australian timbers in service as poles, posts, sleepers and so on. (Papers A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4). These papers were {{at the time of}} publication more rigorous and comprehensive than any published tests. (In this connection, {{it should be noted that}} the “Progress Report” series of the Division of Forest Products were distributed to all known major research workers in the field, abstracted in major abstracting journals, and freely cited in publications. Divisional policy was at that time opposed to publication of results in scientific journals, rather than specialized reports with “targeted” distribution). They were especially notable in the variety of test fungi used; in the development of testing techniques which would allow decay in dense timbers (based on extensive so far unpublished experiments on varying technique parameters); in the use of statistical analyses; and in recognition that no single value can be assigned to “natural durability”, a theme developed in A 14, my final definitive paper on natural durability, which should be a seminal paper for future work in this field. A major contribution has been the clear understanding that weight losses in decay tests cannot have any absolute value and that tests are essentially comparative. Classification of natural durability is therefore best obtained, not by arbitrary classification on weight losses, but by close comparison with “yardstick” timbers whose durability is thoroughly familiar. (A 11, A 12, A 14). These papers, and several unpublished experiments of the same nature, contributed largely to the lists of natural durability of timbers published by the Division of Forest Products and used in Australian Standards (e. g. As 1604 – 1974, on preservation of sawn timber). Similar inter-species comparisons were later made of Papua New Guinea timbers (A 11) where information on natural durability, vital to effective utilization of mixed hardwood rain forests, was virtually absent. From this work on inter-species variation in durability, there came an interest in the causes of this variation and this was investigated for several years in collaboration with Dr. P. Rudman (A 3, A 4, A 7, A 9, A 10). The initial and critical paper in this series (A 3) was a seminal paper in being the first paper to adopt a “toxicity balance” approach, in which the decay {{resistance of}} untreated wood, of extracted wood, and of susceptible wood containing these extractives was measured. This was important because previous workers had concentrated on the toxicity of specific extractives as the explanation of durability, neglecting the possibility that the wood might still be durable after complete removal of these extractives, due to other extractives or to physical factors. My approach also took account of the detoxification of extractives during removal and of the effect of their original distribution in the wood. The paper also contained the first description of a reliable and precise technique for determining decay resistance of wood meal of a variety of species. Since adequate extraction required conversion of wood to a finely-divided form, this technique was essential and was unexpectedly difficult to develop. The general design of the work the decay technique, the decay tests and interpretation of the results were the work of the senior author. This line of work on chemical reasons for decay resistance was gradually transferred to Dr. Rudman. Because of the reputation acquired from earlier work on natural durability, work on natural durability of teak (Tectona grandee) was requested by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. This was concerned with relative durability of plantation-grown and natural teak and with possible detrimental effects of high growth rates on durability. The resultant work (A 5, A 6, A 7, A 8) showed that the widely held belief that fast frown timber was less durable was, at best, only partially true. The papers were important in describing some of the few attempts to test this experimentally and in pioneering multiple regression analyses to assess the relative importance of silvicultural, factors in durability of teak and the potential importance of decay resistance testing in selection and breeding of teak and other <b>timbers.</b> The early <b>stages</b> of my research in wood pathology were confined to natural durability, but with the establishment and rapid growth of a pressure-impregnation wood preservation industry in Australia, and the world-wide need for more sophisticated treatments, my research activities changed to study of chemically enhanced decay resistance. After some preliminary investigations to solve urgent problems (B 1, B 2, B 3), they took the form of an intensive study of water-borne preservatives (especially copper-chrome-arsenic preservatives or “CCA”) and factors affecting their efficiency (B 4, B 5, B 6, B 7, B 16, B 19); and also a study of factors affecting the performance of Australian [?] (B 8, B 10, B 11, B 12, B 18, B 20). CCA studies were important as being the most comprehensive studies to that date of fixed water-borne preservatives (B 6) and as the first to discuss the effect of wood substrate on preservative performance (B 7), a topic of international recognition in the 1970 ’s. My demonstration of the enormous variation in CCA tolerance of basidiomycete wood-destroying fungi (C 1) led to a fundamental study of fungal tolerance (c 4, C 5, C 6). This included the original discovery that basidiomycete cultures could be dedikaryotized by toxic agents (C 2, C 3) a discovery of considerable importance to general biology and experimental fungal taxonomy, as well as to wood pathology (C 5). My later discovery that the toxic effects of arsenic could be antidote by phosphate (B 16, C 7, C 8, B 19, B 21) is also one of fundamental importance to general biology, as well as to wood pathology, especially to techniques of standard testing of wood preservatives (C 7, C 8). The research on creosote established conclusively that removal of phenols from low temperature creosotes lowered their efficiency and led directly to a revision of the Standards Association of Australia specification for creosote (despite considerable opposition from manufacturers). The work on use of propylene oxide for sterilization (B 10, B 11) had important implications in view of its widespread use in laboratory tearing (e. g. in British Standard 338; 1961). I was probably the first worker to use propylene oxide as a sterilant for wood specimens (B 3, C 1) and have much unpublished data on its use, as well as the best statement to date (B 11) of its limitations. Apart from work on CCA and on creosotes, I studied various organic solvent preservatives (B 9, B 13 < B 14) and also studied the use of special techniques for preservation of plywood (B 15, B 17). In general, these papers are regarded as making a substantial contribution to the science of wood pathology and of biodeterioration as well as having had some influence in the application of wood preservation technology in Australia and overseas. Many of the papers (e. g. A 1, A 3, A 8, A 10, A 11, A 14, B 6, B 9, B 17, B 20, C 1, C 2, C 5, C 6, C 7) introduced novel concepts and techniques.
