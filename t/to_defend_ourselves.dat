500|$|Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were {{captured}} {{before they reached}} Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck {{and the rest of}} the platoon in prison. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp, Captain Abe Baum was surprised at the large number of prisoners and was unable to rescue them all. Almost all of Baum's unit was captured; Bouck was recaptured and was finally released one week before the war ended. He was too weak to file a combat report, and hospitalized for several months after the war ended. He did not think his men had accomplished that much.

500|$|In April 1918, {{during the}} latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to {{actively}} recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled [...] "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote [...] "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves,</b> that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army." [...] He did, however, stipulate {{in a letter to the}} Viceroy's private secretary that he [...] "personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe." ...|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We are in a position <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E
5000|$|William B. Caldwell wrote: The law {{of armed}} {{conflict}} requires that, to use force, [...] "combatants" [...] must distinguish individuals presenting a threat from innocent civilians. This basic principle is accepted by all disciplined militaries. In the counterinsurgency, disciplined application of force is even more critical because our enemies camouflage themselves in the civilian population. Our success in Iraq depends on our ability to treat the civilian population with humanity and dignity, even as we remain ready <b>to</b> immediately <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> or Iraqi civilians when a threat is detected.|$|R
60|$|We {{were already}} cleared for action, having had full {{time to prepare}} {{ourselves}} since danger had first threatened us; accordingly, leaving Mr. Langely to supervise such few details as might still remain to demand attention, I had my gig lowered, and went aboard of the Greenwich to consult with Captain Kirby as <b>to</b> means of <b>defending</b> <b>ourselves</b> against this new and additional danger that threatened our existence.|$|R

2500|$|Due {{to their}} capture {{and the general}} chaos of the Battle of the Bulge, the unit's story was not well known. When Lt. Bouck was freed as a {{prisoner}} of war, he {{was too weak to}} file a combat report, and didn't think much of what the men had done. [...] "We were in those foxholes and ... what we did was <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> and try to live through it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{following}} the Clarence Thomas hearings, Cain as the then-CEO of Godfather's Pizza {{expressed concern about}} laws {{making it easier for}} women to sue their supervisors for sexual harassment: “This bill opens the door for opportunists who will use the legislation to make some money....I’m certainly for civil rights, but I don’t know if this bill is fair because of what we’ll have to spend <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> in unwarranted cases.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{position}} is grievous enough {{in that we}} are straitened for food," [...] was the reply; [...] "indeed, although we have of late been fortunate in obtaining supplies, the pressure cannot be borne. Of one thing you may be sure, Ghent will not tamely be starved out. If we cannot obtain fair terms, every man will arm himself and sally out, and, it need be, we will sweep the whole country clear of its flocks and herds, and bring in such stores as we want from all quarters, carrying our arms to the gates of Brussels and Malines in one direction, to Lisle in another, and to Ypres and Dixmuide south of the Lys. Earl though he be, Louis cannot bar every road to us, nor forever keep up a force sufficient to withstand us. Already the feudal lords have kept their levies under arms far beyond the time {{they have a right}} to require them, but this cannot go on. War costs us no more than peace, and whenever we will we can march with 20,000 men in any direction that may please us. As <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> <b>ourselves</b> against assault, I have no fear whatever. Thus, then, so long as Ghent chooses she can maintain the war." [...] He put an emphasis on the last words.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} two such general classes of concern here: the first {{involves}} the fact that the test seems to give inadequate guidance for dealing with the evil-doers we know our world will actually contain, for some behaviors are such that if everyone did them, there would be no evil-doers (or at least none of a certain type), and the behavior in question actually forbids us from acting appropriately to respond <b>to</b> or <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> against such evildoers. E.g., if everyone else in the world is a complete pacifist, then your being a pacifist will not cause any harm; but there are times when others are being violent and threatening you or innocent third parties, in which case your pacifism could lead to more harm than good.|$|R
60|$|This {{latter part}} we found to concern us directly; and though {{we knew it}} to be false, yet, as my partner said very well, if we had fallen into their hands, and they had such a prepossession against us beforehand, {{it had been in}} vain for us <b>to</b> have <b>defended</b> <b>ourselves,</b> or <b>to</b> hope for any good {{quarters}} at their hands; especially considering that our accusers had been our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from them but what rage would have dictated, and ungoverned passion have executed; and therefore it was his opinion, we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, without putting in at any port whatever; because there we could give an account of ourselves, and could prove where we were when the ship put in, whom we bought her of, and the like; and, which was more than all the rest, if we were put to the necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we should be sure to have some justice; and not be hanged first, and judged afterwards.|$|R

60|$|He {{then told}} us that he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen {{belonging}} to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels, and gave an account that the fellow who had run away with the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who were gone a-cruising in her, and that they had already taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very richly laden. This latter part we found to concern us directly, though we knew it to be false; yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepossession against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us <b>to</b> have <b>defended</b> <b>ourselves,</b> or <b>to</b> hope for any good quarter at their hands; especially considering that our accusers had been our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from them but what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion have executed.
