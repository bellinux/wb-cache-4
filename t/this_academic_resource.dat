Because it requires much labor to create metadata contents of <b>academic</b> <b>resources,</b> development of tools or services enabling to easily create metadata contents is expected. This paper proposes a system which converts BIBTEXmetadata of <b>academic</b> <b>resources</b> { widely used by researchers in science and engineering { into NII metadata format in order to support constructions of <b>academic</b> <b>resource</b> repositories.

40|$|Internet {{has become}} one of the {{important}} channels for retrieval of <b>academic</b> <b>resources</b> in the recent years. The roles and service models of academic libraries has been changed accordingly. Most academic libraries have been providing subject directory (subject gateway) for users to browse the highly selected <b>academic</b> <b>resources.</b> On the contrary, few academic libraries managed to provide <b>academic</b> <b>resources</b> for user to retrieve. This article proposes a new model which the libraries will cooperate with search engine providers to support the full-text retrieval for <b>academic</b> <b>resources</b> in a low cost. We discuss the design and implementation of “NTU Scholars Gateway” based on the new model. In addition, the functionalities and future development of NTU Scholars Gateway are discussedas well.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} evidences {{to show that}} {{engineering}} education should be built {{on the base of}} multi disciplines, including technological and non-technological ones, in order to help its graduates work with cross disciplinary engineering issues in multi cultural circumstance. Therefore, if an engineering programme is supported by a number of different disciplines, the benefit to engineering education would be found not only in the integration from multi disciplinary <b>academic</b> <b>resources,</b> but also in quality and efficiency improvement. In order to facilitate the proposed multi discipline supported engineering education, a two dimensional model of academic organizations for higher engineering education is developed in <b>this</b> paper. <b>Academic</b> organizations in higher engineering education institutions are cataloged into two types which stand for real and virtual dimensions respectively in the model. All the academic organizations built based on different disciplines, such as faculties, departments, or schools are considered real organizations while all the programmes which integrate different <b>academic</b> <b>resources</b> from different disciplines are supposed to be virtual organizations. The study finds that with this model it is easy to support teaching for the new challengers of higher engineering education. Also, the study shows that the model will facilitate the quick response to the needs in society and the integration of different <b>academic</b> <b>resources</b> for teaching...|$|R

On this basis, knowledge mining technique will also be adopted to detect the research hotspots of disciplines {{from the perspectives of}} high-frequency themes and themes from influential entity in disciplines, to discover the interdisciplinary hotspots so as to promote the exchange of interdisciplinary and to clear the specific direction of interdisciplinary cooperation. Upon that, all kinds of analysis conclusions and scientific laws which have academic value and could generate academic influence would be obtained to support the decision for scientific evaluation...|$|R
