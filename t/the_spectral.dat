5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many {{of which had been}} categorized at Harvard. When he plotted <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E

Raziel automatically shifts to <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> realm if he runs out of health.

The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> lines of the hydrogen atom.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for satellite retrievals of the atmospheric water vapor column in <b>the</b> blue <b>spectral</b> range. <b>The</b> water vapor {{absorption cross section}} in <b>the</b> blue <b>spectral</b> range is much weaker than in <b>the</b> red <b>spectral</b> range. Thus <b>the</b> detection limit and the uncertainty of individual observations is systematically larger than for retrievals at longer wavelengths. Nevertheless, water vapor retrievals in <b>the</b> blue <b>spectral</b> range have also several advantages: since the surface albedo in <b>the</b> blue <b>spectral</b> range is similar over land and ocean, water vapor retrievals are more consistent than for longer wavelengths. Compared to retrievals at longer wavelengths, over ocean the sensitivity for atmospheric layers {{close to the surface}} is higher due to the (typically 2 to 3 times) higher ocean albedo in the blue. Water vapor retrievals in <b>the</b> blue <b>spectral</b> range are also possible for satellite sensors, which do not measure at longer wavelengths of <b>the</b> visible <b>spectral</b> range like <b>the</b> Ozone Monitoring instrument (OMI).
