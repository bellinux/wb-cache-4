50|$|As {{part of the}} {{nationalisation}} {{of private}} railways on 1 January 1950, railcars also had to {{be integrated into the}} numbering scheme. The spare numbers from 500 were used for this purpose. The railcars were, however, given different class numbers (Stammnummern) from those in the DRG's system. Class 133 was allocated to light, rail-omnibus-like, <b>two-axled</b> <b>vehicles</b> without standard drawbars or buffers. All other twin-axled railcars were given the class number 135. Petrol-driven vehicles were given serial numbers 501 to 503, diesel-motored ones numbers 509 to 550 and diesel-electric vehicles the numbers 551 to 553.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the active suspension control for bogie-based and <b>two-axle</b> railway <b>vehicles.</b> A bogie-based and a <b>two-axle</b> railway <b>vehicle</b> with solid-axle wheelsets, and a <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicle</b> with independently rotating wheelsets (IRWs) are considered. The curving performance of each vehicle is presented and compared. The {{findings in this}} work show that the <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicle</b> performs better during curving than the bogie-based vehicle especially when minimum wheelset lateral displacement (for reduced wear and tear of the wheelset) and control effort are of the main concern. It also {{has the advantage of}} lighter and simpler configuration. The simulation results also show that the IRW provide better curving performance than the solid-axle wheelse...|$|R

50|$|The first {{articulated}} trolleybuses entered {{service in}} 1962 or 1963. These were Shanghai-built model SK663, which gradually replaced many <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{and went on}} to become, at one point, the most numerous model of trolleybus in Shanghai's then-large fleet. The SK663 remained in production until 1969, replaced in 1970 by the SK561G, and later by a succession of newer models of articulated trolleybus.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, eleven Solaris {{articulated}} trolleybuses (nos. 1056-1066) {{were added}} to the fleet, and they began to enter service in December of that year. The last Breda trolleybus was retired in 2012, and the last Menarini vehicles - the last <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the fleet - were retired in March or April 2013. [...] From that point, the fleet comprised only articulated trolleybuses.|$|R
5000|$|... {{passengers}} of <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay {{a total of}} $3.00 to travel {{the entire length of}} the Cimarron Turnpike.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{more than 800}} of the fleet of about 850-900 trolleybuses were articulated, giving Shanghai the {{distinction}} of having more articulated trolleybuses than any other city in the world. About 150 of these were the surviving SK663 examples, dating from the 1960s. The last <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> were withdrawn in 1983, after which the fleet was 100 percent articulated vehicles, {{with a total of}} around 860.|$|R
50|$|Mafersa {{entered the}} field of bus {{manufacturing}} in 1985, with development of a bus chassis and a monocoque (or integral) trolleybus. Production of trolleybuses lasted only from 1986 until 1988 and was relatively small, totalling only 85 vehicles, of which 84 were <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> and one was articulated. Between the start of production in 1985/86 and 1988 more than 600 diesel buses had been delivered to various cities.|$|R
5000|$|SR 874's tolls {{are entirely}} electronic: cash cannot be {{accepted}} along its length. Payment is done either via SunPass transponders or via toll-by-plate billing, {{the latter of}} which attracts a higher cost. Three toll gantries are located along the Don Shula Expressway: the first between the HEFT and Killian Parkway, the second between Killian Parkway and Kendall Drive, and the last between the Snapper Creek and Palmetto Expressways. The relationship between the tolling points and interchanges along SR 874 and SR 878 is that all motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no [...] "free sections". As of July 1, 2013, the cost for a <b>two-axled</b> <b>vehicle</b> to drive {{the entire length of}} SR 874 is $1.00 with a SunPass transponder, or $2.00 via the toll-by-plate program, with the two southern gantries charging $0.25 (SunPass) or $0.50 (toll-by-plate) each, and the northern one charging twice as much. Each additional axle on a vehicle attracts a surcharge equal to the cost of a <b>two-axled</b> <b>vehicle</b> for each gantry passed.|$|R
500|$|... the {{passenger}} or passengers of <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> (such as cars and motorcycles) pay {{a total of}} $13.25 cash toll and $10.60 tag toll to travel {{the entire length of}} the turnpike. Tolls are calculated based on the length of the route traveled, and the toll is as little as 30¢ for motorists driving only a short distance ( [...] , for example) on the turnpike. [...] Drivers in vehicles with more than two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls.|$|R
30|$|Rollover {{and lateral}} {{instability}} are two common issues of heavy-duty trucks, which {{can result in}} fatal accidents and massive losses. Differential braking (DB) and active steering (AS) {{are two of the}} most effective methods to improve the vehicle yaw stability and untripped rollover accidents [1]. DB and AS systems have their own disadvantages, and researchers have proposed several integrated controllers to overcome them. However, existing research mainly focuses on <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> or multi-axle <b>vehicles</b> with <b>two-axle</b> equivalent models [2]. Heavy-duty trucks usually have more than two axles for increased transportation efficiency [3]. DB or AS individually might not control the lateral instability and rollover accident of multi-axle trucks, because multi-axle trucks usually have higher center of gravity and heavier mass and they work under difficult conditions. In a multi-axle truck, distributing the reasonable braking torques and steering angles to suitable wheels is complex. The integrated controller design in a <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicle</b> cannot be used directly in a multi-axle vehicle. The integrated control system for a multi-axle truck has not been fully studied. Therefore, a practical and effective integrated control system is needed urgently, especially for multi-axle trucks.|$|R
500|$|... {{passengers}} of <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay {{a total of}} $3.00 to travel {{the entire length of}} the Cimarron Turnpike and $2.50 to travel {{the entire length of the}} Cherokee Turnpike. Tolls vary based on the entrance and exit used. Both turnpikes accept OTA's Pikepass transponder system as an alternative to cash payment. Pikepass customers receive discounted toll rates; the Pikepass rate for the full length of the Cimarron is $2.85, and the discounted rate for the Cherokee is $2.40.|$|R
50|$|The {{toll plaza}} was located north of Lenox Road (Exit 2). Tolls were {{formerly}} collected in both directions. The toll was $0.50 for a <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicle,</b> $1.50 for three axles, plus $0.50 {{for each additional}} axle. In July 2012, two weeks before voters of Georgia voted on the Transportation Referendum act, Governor Deal said that the toll on GA 400 would be abandoned in November 2013, meaning that, {{at the beginning of}} 2014, SR 400 would be a toll-free road.|$|R

5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of <b>two-axle</b> <b>vehicles</b> (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are collected at the single barrier toll plaza between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, {{it is not possible}} to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechatronic}} wheelset {{concept is}} presented, by which relative torque {{interacting with the}} relative rotation of the wheels is actively applied to both wheels of an axle. This method provides both the increase of running stability at high velocities and steering of the vehicle with decrease of friction power and thus wear in curves.
