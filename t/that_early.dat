5|$|A death {{certificate}} discovered in 2009 shows that Beato {{was born in}} Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence. The {{death certificate}} also indicates {{that he was a}} British subject and a bachelor. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>early</b> in his life Beato and his family moved to Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E
5|$|Gould noted <b>that</b> <b>early</b> Tasmanian {{settlers}} {{regarded the}} abundant green rosella highly as food, and often shot and ate it. He {{agreed that it}} was very tasty after trying it himself. Many farmers saw the species as a pest of orchards, and green rosellas were shot.|$|E

The trio discussed religion and politics and formed a friendship which lasted until McVeigh's execution in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Surface level {{humidity}} is {{less than}} 0.1%. Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a phenomenon known as virga.

5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave off}} the Bahamas organized into Tropical Depression Six {{on the afternoon}} of July 21. The depression became the sixth named storm of the season only two hours later, the first time the sixth storm of the season had ever formed <b>that</b> <b>early</b> in the season. The storm headed northward from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganized by July 24 under the effects of shear and drier air. It moved erratically, inching closer to Bermuda while barely remaining a tropical storm. Bermuda received some strong wind gusts, but was otherwise unaffected. Tropical Storm Franklin then accelerated north and northeast, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States, and intensified to near hurricane strength. Eventually, Franklin became extratropical along the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent <b>that</b> <b>early</b> attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; it is also possible <b>that</b> <b>early</b> African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea <b>that</b> <b>early</b> experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E
5|$|At 13:10, the RAF {{formation}} {{flew over}} the mud flats {{to the west of}} Cuxhaven and Wesermünde and came under heavy ground fire from the German flak positions, 214, 244 and 264. As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti-aircraft units 212, 222, 252, 262 and 272 opened fire. Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and all the other naval ships in the dock opened fire in support. In the distance, at Schillig Point, the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip. In a quick briefing, JG 1's commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington. A stern attack was dangerous, as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated cone of fire. One weakness also noted was <b>that</b> <b>early</b> types of Wellingtons lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. This meant if the German fighters hit the wings, the bomber was liable to burn.|$|E
5|$|Balukas was {{considered}} a prodigy, coming to the public's attention first at 6 years of age at a pool exhibition held at New York City's Grand Central Terminal and thereafter appearing on television, including on CBS's primetime television show, I've Got a Secret. At just 9 years old she placed 5th in the 1969 U.S. Open straight pool championship, and placed 4th and 3rd respectively in the following two U.S. Opens. From <b>that</b> <b>early</b> start, Balukas completely dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out <b>that</b> <b>early</b> morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|During June and July 1864, Confederate forces {{under the}} command of General Jubal A. Early patrolled the Shenandoah Valley. Early's successes were a {{political}} liability for President Abraham Lincoln, and caused Union leaders to divert resources away from Richmond and West Virginia. Union soldiers from the Army of West Virginia began arriving via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Martinsburg, West Virginia, on July 19, and had an initial success in the Battle of Rutherford's Farm. A few days later, Early tricked Union General George Crook into believing <b>that</b> <b>Early</b> had sent a large part of his Confederate force to Richmond. The result of this deception was a July 24 Confederate victory near Winchester, Virginia, at the Second Battle of Kernstown. Union troops, in some cases panic stricken, retreated to {{the north side of the}} Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate <b>that</b> <b>early</b> in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge <b>that</b> <b>early</b> settlers claimed {{they could hear}} the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.|$|E
5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>early</b> {{meetings and}} writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} gays and lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization may be {{important}} in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not {{increasing the number of}} sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact <b>that</b> <b>early</b> generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E
