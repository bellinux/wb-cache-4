40|$|A {{mechanical}} fractionator {{designed for}} {{more efficient and}} accurate separation of medium and fine silt frac-tions from soils and unconsolidated geological sediments i described. Directions are given for its construction and use, including a scaled drawing and photograph of the apparatus. Fractionation of soils and unconsolidated geo-logical sediments into particle-size separates for subsequent mineralogical analysis is a laborious and time consuming procedure. A sliding-base mechanical fractionator that permits more effi-cient and accurate separation of medium and fine (20 - 5 ~ and 5 - 2 #, respectively) silt fractions from unconsolidated sediments has been de-veloped. For the coarse silt (50 - 20 /z) fraction, the unit developed by Beavers and Jones (1962, p. 303 - 304) is satisfactory and efficient. However, be-cause of long sedimentation times, this unit is too time consuming when separating the medium and fine silt fractions. In {{order to reduce the}} sedimentation time but retain the same prin-ciple of operation, the design was modified so the unit could be placed under a centrifugal force. The fractionator developed is shown in figures 1 and 2. The apparatus consists of a plexiglas cylinder mounted on a plexiglas slide, the latter being held under pressure against a <b>teflon</b> <b>plate</b> by two adjustable plexiglas slide clamps. The <b>teflon</b> <b>plate</b> is cemented to the slide base with a Flurocarbon teflon bonding kit and fixed in place with 10 flathead brass screws. By adjust-ment of 8 wing nuts threaded on machine screws anchored to the slide base, sufficient pressure is applied to the slide clamps to hold the slide firm against he teflon insert to prevent leakage. The fractionator is adapted to a No. 2 International centrifuge by means of a reinforced stainless steel stirrup which cradles the fractionator and is interlocked to a brass collar which encircles the cylinder and is sandwiched between tw...|$|E

The effect of the air pressure at the pyroelectric/air interface, on the EDEF, was determined in the interval 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^- 6 torr.

40|$|Abstract—A free-space, {{non-destructive}} {{method for}} measuring the complex permittivity of a double-layer bulk dielectrics and thin film oxide layers at microwave frequencies have been developed. The method utilizes a spot-focusing antenna system {{in conjunction with a}} vector network analyzer in the range of 18 – 26 GHz. The bulk dielectric was measured using the Transmission Method and Metal-Backed Method, while the Metal-Backed Method was used to investigate the thin films. Both types of samples were sandwiched between two quarter-wavelength <b>Teflon</b> <b>plates</b> to improve the mismatch at the frequencies of measurement. The thin film sample arrangement was backed by an additional metal plate. The double-layer bulk dielectric samples were Teflon-PVC and Plexiglas-PVC, while the thin film samples consisted of SiO 2 layers of different thicknesses grown on doped and undoped Si wafer substrates. The relative permittivity obtained for PVC ranged between 2. 62 to 2. 93, while those for Plexiglas exhibited values between 2. 45 to 2. 63. The relative permittivity of SiO 2 deposited on these wafers was between 3. 5 to 4. 5. All these values are in good agreement with published data. The advantage of the method is its ability to measure the dielectric properties of the films at the midfrequency band irrespective of the substrate type used.

40|$|A sliding seismic {{isolator}} that, {{due to its}} sliding property, {{cuts off}} the inertia force acting on the bridge pier is actively being developed. However, some concerns have been expressed about the performance of this isolator under the effect of vertical ground motions. As it is well known, the sliding bearings are velocity and vertical-load dependent; therefore, under the effect of vertical ground motions, the friction coefficient is expected to change greatly, affecting the horizontal earthquake response. In this study, pseudo-dynamic tests and numerical simulations are performed to analyze the effect of vertical seismic loads on the horizontal earthquake response characteristics of this sliding seismic isolator. The isolation system consists of a sliding bearing that generates the friction damping, and of a rubber bearing that generates the restoration force.

40|$|This is a {{technique}} for measuring gross alpha particle emission from interior contaminated surfaces. The technique utilizes electret ionization chambers (EICs), which consist of a charged <b>Teflon</b> <b>plate</b> (the electret) and an electrically-conductive plastic chamber of 145 ml volume. To measure very low levels of alpha contamination, the EIC is left in place on the surface to be measured for about 48 hours. The change in the surface charge of the electret {{is a measure of}} the ionization during the measurement period. The rate of change of the charge is converted into an activity using an appropriate calibration factor. This system has the ability to make accurate gross alpha contamination measurements while being subject to a high airborne radon concentration, such as might occur in certain buildings or during an atmospheric inversion. Previous studies of the effectiveness of these EIC`s focused on levels of alpha contamination much higher than is allowed for unrestricted release of material at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). This study evaluated the performance of EIC`s at levels from 100 disintegrations per minute (dpm) per 100 cm{sup 2 } to below 20 dpm per 100 cm{sup 2 } (all measurements are referenced to a 4 {pi} geometry). The EIC`s were found to be within 5 % accuracy, as compared to a gas flow proportional counter calibrated with a NIST-traceable source.

As for traditional machine vision (MV), spectral image registration {{is an important step}} which affects the quality of the sorting system. Unfortunately, it currently still remains challenging to accurately register the images acquired with the different imagers as this requires a reference with good contrast over the full spectral range. Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop an accurate high contrast checkerboard over the full spectral range. From the investigated white and dark materials, Teflon and Acktar were found to present very good contrast over the full spectral range from 400 to 2500 nm, with a minimal contrast ratio of 60 % in the Vis-NIR and 98 % in the SWIR. The Metal Velvet self-adhesive coating from Acktar was selected as it also provides low specular reflectance. This was taped onto a near-Lambertian polished <b>Teflon</b> <b>plate</b> and one out of two squares were removed after laser cutting the dark coating with an accuracy below 0. 1 mm. As standard technologies such as nano-second pulsed lasers generated unwanted damages on both materials, a pulsed femto-second laser setup from Lasea with 60 m accuracy was used to manufacture the checkerboard.

Composite membranes {{were made from}} these polyurethane/MWNT solutions by casting them into <b>Teflon</b> <b>plates.</b> SEM photographs demonstrated that the MWNT distributed relatively homogenously in polyurethane matrix at low content and preferred to align in the membrane 2 -dimension plane. The shape recovery and mass transfer properties of the prepared membranes were studied. Thermo-mechanical cyclic tensile testing results suggested that the shape recovery ratio increased prominently at below 2. 0 wt% of MWNT because of the MWNTs high interaction with the hard segments; however at 3. 0 wt% MWNT content, the shape recovery ratios decreased which can be ascribed to the relatively inhomogeneous distribution of MWNT and the decrease phase separation of the polyurethane at this high MWNT content. The water vapor permeability (WVP) studies showed that at below the soft segment melting transition temperature, at 0. 25 wt% MWNT content, the WVP of the composite membrane decreased because the nano-sized MWNT acting as nucleating agent, thus, enhanced soft segment ordered crystal structure. In contrast, with increasing MWNT content, the WVP increased because in one aspect, MWNT constrained the forming of ordered soft segment phase structure; in another aspect, the straight MWNT with large aspect ratios offered a relatively straight "free" pathway for water molecule diffusion {{on the surface of}} MWNT or inside MWNT to pass through. At temperature above the soft segment phase melting transition temperature, the WVP increased markedly with increasing MWNT content. This could also be attributed to the pathway effect of MWNT by forming a channel through which water molecules could diffuse rapidly. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Starch as a {{renewable}} and biodegradable polymer, is {{an essential}} alternative to synthetic polymers in production of films for food packaging and agricultural mulching applications. The major problem with the plasticized starch is its increased permeability to water vapor and oxygen and its low strength. To improve these properties, nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC), which has the Young’s modulus as high as 134 GPa, has been tried as nanofillers. The major concern in preparation of nanocomposites is the uniform distribution of nanofillers within the starch molecules, which in turn decides their performance characteristics. In this work, we have prepared NCC from microcrystalline cellulose by high pressure homogenization process. Due to high surface energy and hydrophilicity of formed NCC particles, they tend to form aggregates in water. To prevent this, during homogenization, solubilized starch was added as stabilizers. The starch macromolecule stabilized the formed NCC by steric hindrance. The average diameter of nanocellulose prepared without starch was 197. 8 ± 4. 0 nm (Polydispersity index: 0. 239) while that of stabilized by starch was 391. 7 ± 36. 2 nm (Polydispersity index: 0. 458). The increased size corresponds to the coating layer formed by starch molecules. To prepare starch film, soluble starch (4 %) having glycerol (2 %) as plasticizing agent were gelatinized by stirring in hot plate. For nanocomposite starch film, the nanocellulose was added in varying concentrations (2 % and 4 %) to starch / glycerol solution and mixed using a high speed mixer for uniform distribution. These solutions were casted on <b>Teflon</b> <b>plates</b> and dried at 50 ºC, overnight. The uniformity of distribution of NCC in the starch film was analyzed by FTIR at multiple locations of the film.

40|$|An {{ionic liquid}} (IL) is a salt, which usually {{is in the}} liquid state at normal {{temperature}} and pressure. The properties of ILs can be adjusted for various processes and applications by choosing different combinations of ions. Similar to other salts, ILs contain only ions with positive (cations) and negative (anions) charges in equal proportions. However, to prevent solidification, ions in ionic liquids usually contain bulky organic chemical groups, which, apart from electrostatic interactions, promote other types of interactions between ions, such as: (i) van-der-Waals interactions; (ii) hydrogen bonding; (iii) - stacking, etc., depending on the particular chemical structure of the ions. All these interactions, in combination, may lead to formation of specific microstructures in ILs, which may vary with temperature caused by changing thermal rotational and translational energies of the ions. Ions in these microstructures may have preferential orientations relative to each other, maintain anisotropic properties {{similar to those in}} liquid crystals or, in some specific cases, may even separate into microscopically organised liquid phases. Therefore, the dynamics of ILs may also be dependent on their microstructure. In many practical applications ionic liquids are placed on surfaces or in confinements. Solid surfaces introduce extra forces, which may be specific to the charge of the ions or/and to functional groups in the ILs. The geometry and interactions of ions in confinements or/and pores of materials may also disrupt specific bulk microstructures of ILs. Both confinement effects and interactions of ions with surfaces are manifested in the translational dynamics of the ions. One of the most direct and informative methods to study translational dynamics of ILs is pulse-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR). In this thesis the results of PFG-NMR studies on a few classes of ILs are reported: (i) the historically “standard” (since Walden’s discovery in 1914) ionic liquid, the ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) and (ii) halogen-free orthoborate-based phosphonium, imidazolium and pyrrolidinium ILs with varied structure and lengths of alkyl chains in cations, and varied structures of orthoborate anions. These ILs were studied in bulk at different temperatures, and also in confinements, such as between parallel glass and <b>Teflon</b> <b>plates</b> and in mesoporous Vycor glass. It was found that diffusion coefficients of cations and anions in EAN, phosphonium and pyrrolidinium orthoborate ILs in bulk are different, but according to the standard Stocks-Einstein model, they correspond to diffusion of ions in homogeneous liquids. A change in the chemical structure of one of the ions results in a change in both the diffusion coefficient of the oppositely charged ion and the activation energy of diffusion for both ions in an IL. Similar effects were observed from the chemical shifts and diffusion coefficients measured by NMR for imidazolium orthoborate ILs dissolved in polyethylene glycol solutions, in which imidazolium cations strongly interact with PEG molecules, further affecting the diffusion of orthoborate anions via electrostatic interactions. A liquid-liquid phase separation was suggested for a few phosphonium and pyrrolidinium bis(mandelato) borate ILs, in which a divergence of diffusion coefficients and activation energies of diffusion for cations and anions was detected at temperatures below ca 50 °C. In addition, a free-volume theory was invoked to explain the dependences of density of ILs on the alkyl chain length in cations. It was also found that for a phosphonium bis(salicylato) borate IL confined in 4 nm mesoporous Vycor glass the diffusion coefficients of ions increase by a factor of 35 ! This phenomenon was explained by the dynamic heterogeneity of this IL in micropores and empty voids of the Vycor glass. For EAN IL in confinements between glass and <b>Teflon</b> <b>plates,</b> the diffusion of ethylammonium cations and nitrate anions is significantly anisotropic, i. e. slower {{in the direction of the}} normal to the plates and faster along the plates compared to diffusion of the ions in bulk. A plausible explanation of this PFG NMR data is that EAN forms layers near polar and non-polar solid surfaces. A similar phenomenon, to a lesser extent, was also observed for phosphonium cations of bis(mandelato) borate, bis(salicylato) borate and bis(oxalato) borate confined between glass plates. The results of these studies may have implications in modeling tribological performance, i. e., friction and wear reduction for contact pairs of different materials lubricated by various classes of ionic liquids.

40|$|Introduction: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) has various {{attractive}} properties such as transparency, mechanical toughness, {{light weight}} and good weatherability [1]. Therefore, it {{is a candidate}} {{as a substitute for}} inorganic glass especially in the automobile industry due to high demand for a lightweight vehicle. In order to replace an inorganic glass, however, the thermal stability must be improved as it has a low glass transition temperature (Tg) (ca. 105 oC). Generally, the introduction of cross-linking and hydrogen bonding is known to enhance Tg of a polymer. Nevertheless, these methods have disadvantages such as losing thermoplastic nature. In this study, a salt with low lattice energy is mixed with PMMA by the solution blend technique. The salt used in this study is well mixed with PMMA and enhances the Tg without sacrificing the transparency and flowability of the material. Experiment: PMMA and 5 to 60 wt% of lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCF 3 SO 3, LiFMS) or lithium perchlorate (LiClO 4) were dissolved in the mixture solvent of dichloromethane (90 wt%) and methanol (10 wt%) and stirred for 1 hour. The solution was cast on the <b>Teflon</b> <b>plate</b> and dried at 160 ºC for 30 hours. The obtained mixtures were compressed into flat sheets with a thickness of 300 μm by a compression-molding machine for 3 min at 240 ºC under 10 MPa and subsequently cooled at 25 ºC. Tg of the samples was measured by using a dynamical mechanical analyzer and a differential scanning calorimeter. 3. Results and Discussion: Figure 1 shows Tg, measured by differential scanning calorimeter of the blends containing various amounts of the salts, in which the salt amount is expressed by the molar ratio of the lithium to the carbonyl group in PMMA. The result indicates that the salt addition greatly enhances Tg without scarifying its transparency. The Tg enhancement is presumably caused by the electrostatic interaction between Li-cation and carbonyl group in PMMA as indicated in attenuated total reflection results. As a result, the blends show high Tg. Moreover, all the blends are found to be transparent for PMMA/ LiFMS in the experimental range, while the blends with more than 50 wt% of LiClO 4 are opaque. 4. Conclusion: The Tg enhancement of PMMA was observed by the addition of the lithium salts. Electrostatic interaction between lithium cation and the carbonyl group is responsible for the Tg enhancement. Supervisor:山口　政之マテリアルサイエンス研究科修...|$|E
40|$|Keratin, one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} natural biopolymers, can be obtained from different sources such as feather, wool, hair, nail and horn. Due to the generation of large amounts of these biopolymers as a waste from textile, livestock and slaughter industries, it is of significance to recover these by-products and convert them into useful biomaterials. Organic solvents have been investigated in the past to dissolve keratin based products, but with limited success. Recently, ionic liquids have been used as an alternative to conventional organic solvents in biomass dissolution due to their unique physical and chemical properties; in this study, task specific ionic liquids have been developed and investigated as solvents for keratin based biopolymers (turkey feather and wool). Imidazolium (1 -allyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([AMIM]Cl), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl), 1 -allyl- 3 -methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([AMIM][DCA])), and choline based ionic liquids ([choline][thioglycolate] and [bis-(2 -ethylhexyl) ][thioglycolate]) were synthesized, characterized and tested for feather and wool solubilisation. Apart from these aprotic ionic liquids, protic ionic liquids (such as hydroxyl ammonium based ionic liquids (eg dimethylethanolammonium formate (([DMEA][formate])) were also synthesized and employed in the dissolution of keratin. Overall, the most effective, were the imidazolium based ionic liquids containing dicyanamide or chloride anions, showing a significant solubility (up to 45 wt. % for feather and up to 20 wt. % for wool) for keratins. The dissolved keratins were regenerated by precipitation from water and characterised by spectroscopic methods. The influence of reducing agents and deep eutectic mixtures on keratin solubility was also investigated in this study. The addition of reducing agents to the ionic liquids increased the amount of dissolved keratin by 50 - 100 mg g- 1. Deep eutectic solvent mixtures were shown to be a potentially less expensive alternative solvent for dissolution of keratin biopolymers, however there was no significant increase in keratin solubility compared to ionic liquids. The next stage of the study involved the production of regenerated keratin bio-materials in the form of films, fibers and gel. This process could form the basis of a commercial process. The method employed in this study involved the dissolution of keratin, casting the dissolved keratin onto a <b>Teflon</b> <b>plate,</b> soaking the plates into water to diffuse out the ionic liquid and drying the material for further mechanical testing. The recycling of the protic ionic liquid was also investigated.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{contribution}} was on the formulation and verification of a process-based model of the mixed-matrix membrane that consisted of the polyimide matrix synthesized from the monomers 4, 4 ’-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphtalic anhydride and 4, 4 ’-oxydianiline, and silicalite- 1. When a solution of a polyimide precursor in N,N-dimethylformamide was ready, silicalite- 1 particles were dispersed in the solution and the dispersion was subsequently cast on a <b>Teflon</b> support <b>plate.</b> An initial mass ratio of silicalite- 1 and polyimide was about 1 : 1. After solvent removal, the films were heated in subsequent steps up to 230 °C for two hour. From a process-based model point of view, a key operation of the entire synthesis was slow sedimentation of silicalite particles in the viscous solution. Preliminary observation of 2 D cuts through the solid membrane in a scanning electron microscope revealed {{that there were a}} lot of contacts among the silicalite particles. Therefore, a sequential (ballistic) deposition algorithm, well representing sedimentation in a low-energy environment, was used to create an off-lattice model of spatial distribution of the silicalite particles in the polyimide matrix...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The current {{technique}} of human pancreas digestion for islet isolation relies on selective distribution of collagenase delivered via the pancreatic duct to produce digestion and removal of peri-acinar fibrous tissue. However, the collagenase has relatively {{little effect on}} the interlobular fibrous tissue, which must therefore be broken down by mechanical means within the digestion chamber so as to release the contained acini and islets. The current way of achieving this in the Ricordi chamber is to place five or six stainless steel balls within the chamber and shake vigorously. The shaking presumably breaks down the interlobular fibrous tissue by a combination of shear force induced by the movement of tissue through the shaking process, assisted by numerous blows from the steel balls. Intuitively, one would expect some islets would be destroyed rather than released by such a battering. METHODS: In an attempt to improve the efficiency of islet isolation we have designed a new digestion/filtration chamber that consists of a glass cylinder, sealed with <b>Teflon</b> <b>plates</b> holding in mesh filters at each end, secured in place by a central threaded tie-rod and external knurled nuts. A ring-shaped piston within the cylinder can be pushed up and down the travel by two rods passing out through sealed ports in the Teflon disk at one end and connected to an external handle. The handle is used to gently push the piston up and down the travel of the cylinder, which pushes the fluid and tissue through the central lumen of the ring-piston. A series of hooks attached to the central tie-rod catch the fibrous strands of the passing tissue; the shearing forces produced cause disruption by a process thought to be similar to teasing the tissue apart with fine forceps. RESULTS: A series of initial experiments with human pancreas showed the prototype to be too large, causing temperature control problems, and a redesigned smaller chamber was produced, maintaining the crucial design features. Experience processing five human pancreata has now demonstrated that in three of five pancreata the new chamber produced a good yield (> 200, 000 I. E.) of remarkably well separated and intact islets, the entire dispersion process being under 1 hour. However, in two isolations the collagenase digestion was poor, with few free islets. A copy of the new chamber (reserved for porcine work only) has been produced, as well as a copy of the Ricordi chamber. We have confirmed that the new chamber can isolate porcine islets in large numbers (> 5000 islets/g pancreas [n = 2], but note that pig islets are small). CONCLUSION: These preliminary studies are sufficiently encouraging to justify further direct comparison with the Ricordi chamber for the purpose of animal and human islet isolation...|$|R

40|$|There are {{tremendous}} interests {{regarding the}} wettability of solid surfaces and controlling the wettability on the solid surfaces in industry, technology such as efficiency of oil recovery, micro-fluidics and nano-fluidics, drag reduction on airplane wings, efficient {{power plants and}} many other applications. To resolve such challenges, it is required to enhance the knowledge more deeply to understand the underlying physics of fluid/solid interaction at the liquid contact line that describes the dynamics of spreading. Hence, in this research, experimental techniques have been performed to investigate parametric study about {{the dynamics of the}} liquid contact line (i. e. three-phase contact line) with consideration on molecular-kinetic theory (which concentrates on the adhesion of molecules at the vicinity of the liquid contact line) and the hydrodynamics theory (which focuses on the bulk motion of the liquid on the solid surface). Over half a century, there have been many experimental/numerical investigations of the moving contact line in forced and spontaneous spreading. Surprisingly, there have been no experimental studies comparing these for the same solid/liquid/vapor system. In the present research such experiments have been performed on identical liquid-solid systems. It has been found out that there exists a huge distinction between experimental results obtained from spontaneous and forced spreading. For spontaneous spreading, excellent agreement has been found using the hydrodynamics theory, as expected. For forced spreading it was shown that hydrodynamic theory does not apply, but instead the molecular-kinetic theory does. This distinction between spontaneous and forced systems has never been noted before. Moreover, this research has provided a hypothesis for predicting the more appropriate model to describe the contact line dynamics for spontaneous and forced systems. The forced spreading dynamics on low-energy surfaces (i. e. hydrophobic, ultra-hydrophobic glass surfaces, and micro-textured Teflon surfaces) has been investigated. The dynamics of spreading of several Polyethylene Glycol/Water (PEG/water) mixtures, with different weight ratios signifying the effect of the viscous force on spreading, on Teflon substrates (i. e. hydrophobic surfaces), ultra-hydrophobic sprayed glass substrates, and micro-textured <b>Teflon</b> <b>plates</b> have been investigated using Wilhelmy plate method with Tensiometer. It has been found out that spreading dynamics of the PEG/water mixtures on hydrophobic surfaces, ultra-hydrophobic glass surfaces, and micro-textured Teflon substrates are described more appropriately with molecular-kinetic theory. The wettability of emulsions is a prominent factor with a broad impact in an extensive variety of industrial applications ranging from the petroleum to cosmetic industries. Surprisingly, there is no comprehensive study of emulsion spreading to date. In this research, the spreading of water/silicone oil emulsions on glass substrates was investigated. The time dependent variation of dynamic contact angle, base diameter, and the spreading rate of the emulsion droplets were studied. The effect of water/silicone oil weight percentage as well as the droplet size and dispersed phase bubble size were also investigated. The weight percentage of water/silicone oil emulsion and droplet size did not {{have a significant impact on}} the spreading dynamics; however the dispersed phase bubble size affected the spreading dynamics substantially. The coarsening of the dispersed phase bubbles was the key factor in the distinct spreading behavior of emulsions compared to pure liquids. The only disadvantage of the Tensiometer is the fact of neglecting the viscous force in force measurement method applied on the plate’s surface during advancing and receding motion in the pool of highly viscous liquid. This neglect makes the Tensiometer to loose its extent of flexibility for being used for experiments with highly viscous liquids and for large liquid contact line speeds. To address this challenge, a viscous model for dynamic contact angle measurement using force-balance method with Tensiometer has been proposed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{investigates the}} {{deformation}} of ferrofluid marbles {{in the presence}} of a permanent magnet. Ferrofluid marbles are formed using a water-based ferrofluid and 1 -µm hydrophobic polytetrafluoride particles. A marble placed on a <b>Teflon</b> coated glass <b>plate</b> deforms under gravity. In the presence of a permanent magnet, the marble is further deformed with a larger contact area. The geometric parameters are normalized by the radius of an undistorted spherical marble. The paper first discusses a scaling relationship between the dimensionless radius of the contact area as well as the dimensionless height and the magnetic Bond number. The dimensionless contact radius is proportional to the fourth root of the magnetic Bond number. The dimensionless height scales with the inverse square root of the magnetic Bond number. In the case of a moving marble dragged by a permanent magnet, the deformation is evaluated as the difference between advancing and receding curvatures of the top view. The dimensionless height and the contact diameter of the marble do not significantly depend on the speed or the capillary number. The scaling analysis and experimental data show that the deformation is proportional to the capillary number. ...|$|R
40|$|Block shear is {{a complex}} failure {{mechanism}} in bolted and welded steel components such as gusset plates, webs of coped beams, angles and tees. It presumes a combination of tension rupture and shear yield. Multiple variables affect the block shear capacity and ductility of a connection. This study investigates the effects of bolt pretension, connection eccentricity and friction force transfer {{through a series of}} destructive experiments followed by refined finite element simulation. Clamping forces create a complex triaxial stress field compounded by the stress concentration at the bolt holes. In-plane load eccentricity with respect to the centerline of the connection causes a change in stress/strain distributions due to the addition of a moment. That alters the magnitude of stress/strain demand on both the tension plane and shear legs. Friction between the connected plates also acts as a means of load transfer between the connected parts; however, little is known about its contribution to the ultimate capacity of the connection. Five full scale connections were tested to compare two levels of bolt tension under two level of eccentricity. In addition, one test was performed including a layer of <b>Teflon</b> between the <b>plates</b> to isolate the effect of friction. Effects of pretensioning, eccentricity, and friction were then analyzed by comparing load-displacement responses and strain data. Bilinear curves provided a means to identify changes in the ductility and total energy absorbed by the connection before failure that gives a comprehensive view of the change in the behavior of the connection. A nonlinear finite element model for the five cases was developed using ABAQUS to verify the results of the experiment. This model will enable a comprehensive study of a variety of connection geometries, material characteristics, loading, etc...|$|R
40|$|Single cell {{analysis}} (SCA) {{has obtained}} great importance among biologists for elucidating cell-to-cell differences {{that are difficult}} to recognize in bulk measurements. Flow cytometry {{is one of the most}} widely used techniques to characterize non-adhering cells, however, its inability to analyze cells with spatio-temporal resolution is a major drawback. Continuous monitoring and analysis of non-adhering cells requires involvement of certain trapping systems for the precise manipulation and retention of these cells at a desired location. To date, various microfluidic platforms have demonstrated high-throughput single cell studies of non-adhering cells by implementing cell-specific trapping strategies 1, 2. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of electro-wetting-on-dielectric based digital microfluidics (EWOD-DMF), as automated and miniaturized systems to trap single yeast cells and analyze their responses towards antifungal treatment at a single cell resolution over time. A DMF chip is a two-plate system in which the bottom plate carries a planar array of chromium electrodes (2. 8 mm x 2. 8 mm) on a glass substrate, covered with a layer of dielectric material and Teflon-AF, and the top plate consists of an Aluminum-Teflon coated glass plate (Fig. 1 (a,b)). Discrete reagent droplets sandwiched between the two plates are transported across the electrode array based on the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) actuation principle. In addition, a microarray containing 21, 000 cylindrical cavities (5 μm diameter and 3 μm deep) is fabricated in the top <b>plate</b> <b>Teflon</b> layer in a such way that the walls of the cavity remain hydrophobic whereas, the cavity bottom is hydrophilic. The on-chip cell trapping is achieved by allowing the cells to sediment on the array for 10 minutes. This is followed by subsequently transporting the cell droplet over the microarray multiple times (referred to as transport cycles). During this time, the cells enter the microwells by capillary forces and are trapped in the hydrophilic region of the cavities (Fig. 1 (c)). The trapped cells are then subjected to antifungal treatment (Amphotericin B; AMB) and monitored over a period of 4 hours. The effect of the number of transport cycles on cell trapping efficiency and cell viability was analyzed using propidium iodide. Out of the three different transport cycles tested, the optimum number of transport cycles was obtained as 15 (Fig. 2 (a)). The decrease in trapping efficiency observed at higher transport cycles, indicate the removal of previously trapped cells and is possibly due to the strong shear forces that originated from transporting the cell droplet multiple times. In line with this hypothesis, a decrease in the viability of trapped cells was observed while increasing the number of transport cycles. Secondly, the response of trapped cells towards treatment with 100 μM AMB were investigated. Time-dependent killing was observed and approximately 100 % cell death was reached after 4 hours (Fig. 2 (b)). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such demonstration of the use of EWOD-based DMF chips for in vitro cytotoxicity assays on single yeast cells with spatio-temporal resolution. More importantly, this platform can be used for thorough screening of newly developed antifungals in a semi high-throughput manner. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy has}} been {{extensively}} studied nowadays by many researchers around the world. Among this renewable energy, there is solar cell {{which is one of}} the promising candidates to overcome the energy crisis in the future. With low cost production and simple fabrication of Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC), DSC is one of the best solar cell which could overcome the energy problem in the future. Anatase-phased Ti 02 film is the conventional material for photoelectrode semiconductor layer of the DSC, even though rutile-phased Ti 02 gives same characteristics such as band gap property. It may be due to the preparation condition for the rutile phase, which needs higher temperature than 900 OC for preparation. The rutile-phased Ti 02 has good electron transportation compared to the anatase phase. Because of this, the rutile-phased Ti 02 has been applied to some electronic devices. Nanostructures play main roles in electron transportation in any electronic devices. By preparing the rutile-phased Ti 02 and applying nanostructures in the fabrication, DSC performances should be improved. The rutile-phased Ti 02, therefore, is also strong candidate for high performance DSCs. In the present study, DSCs based on the rutile-phased Ti 02 have been successfully prepared and their performances have been improved by applying two kinds of nanostructures; aligned rutile-phased Ti 02 nanorods and rutile-phased TiOz nanoflowers. Both nanostructures were prepared using hydrothermal method at 150 OC for different reaction times. The nanostructures were grown directly on a fluorine doped tin oxide glass (FTO coated glass). As for the growth mechanism, the aligned rutile-phased Ti 02 nanorods were firstly grown on the FTO coated glass. Then, through chemical reaction and pressure inside an autoclave, the rutile-phased TiOa nanoflowers were synthesized and deposited on top of the aligned nanorods. Mixture of titanium butoxide, hydrochloric acid, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and deionized water was prepared and put into the 300 ml autoclave made by <b>Teflon.</b> The FTO <b>plates</b> were put in horizontally with FTO surface facing upwards. After the hydrothermal process, the plates were rinsed with deionzed water and annealed at 450 "C for 30 min. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was carried out to observe a surface morphology and a thickness of the prepared rutile-phased Ti 02 films. X-ray diffractions (XRD) characterization was taken to examine and determine the Ti 02 crystalline phases in prepared films. Solar simulator was used to measure the performances of Dye-sensitized solar cell based on the rutile-phased Ti 02. For the dye adsorption property, UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer measure an amount of dye adsorption in the film. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to determine a conductivity of the DSCs. In early stage of the study, influence of TBOT concentration on the surface morphology, structural properties and solar cell efficiency were investigated for the rutile-phased Ti 02 films and the DSCs based on the films. The highest energy conversion efficiency, 0. 4 % was achieved using different solution concentration for the preparation under the solar light illumination 100 r n ~ c r n(- 1 ~. 5 AM). Low dye adsorption in the film was the reason for low energy conversion efficiency. By growing the rutile-phased Ti 02 nanoflowers on top of the aligned Ti 02 nanorods, the dye adsorption is increased. This is due to an increase in surface area of Ti 02 layer for dye to adsorb. Cetyltrimethylarnrnonium bromide (CTAB) is introduced to control and enhance the growth of rutile-phased Ti 02 nanoflowers. As a result, the best efficiency of 3. 11 % is obtained and the improvement is mainly attributed to an introduction of Ti 02 nanoflowers for more dye adsorption. Energy conversion efficiency as high as 4. 27 % is achieved through some improvement on the DSC based on rutile-phased Ti 02 layer. Two steps of hydrothermal process are conducted. First step is to prepare only the aligned rutile-phased Ti 02 nanorods. At this step, very dense and aligned nanorods are obtained with 3 pm in length. In the second step, the rutile-phased TiOz nanoflowers are synthesized. By preparing new solution with some modification, a large amount of Ti 02 nanoflowers with smaller sizes are obtained. The thickness is about 15 pm. Energy conversion efficiency of 4. 27 % for nanostructured rutile-phased Ti 02 based DSC is the highest record nowadays...|$|R
