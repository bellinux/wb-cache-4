5000|$|The PSL rifle is {{typically}} issued with a 4×24 optical sight called LPS 4×6° TIP2 (Lunetă Puṣcă Semiautomată Tip 2, or [...] "Scope, Semi-Automatic Rifle, Type #2") {{which is a}} simplified version of the Russian PSO-1 <b>telescopic</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>sight.</b> This optical sight features 4× magnification, a 6° field of view, and the objective lens is 24 mm in diameter. It shares the basic design and stadiametric rangefinder found in the reticle of the original Russian PSO-1 scope. The LPS 4×6° TIP2 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors. Besides the BDC elevation or vertical adjustment control of the reticle, the windage or horizontal adjustment control of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps etc. The reticle illumination of the LPS 4×6° TIP2 is provided by (radioactive) tritium. The tritium light source has to be replaced every 8-12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay.|$|R
50|$|The rifle barrel is {{thermally}} shielded along {{a considerable}} {{part of the}} barrel by a polymer shroud. It uses a different bipod-stock configuration from its predecessor, which is built {{just ahead of the}} receiver. GIAT studies lead to a new three groove conical barrel. Tapering the barrel from the throat area up to the first 100 mm of the barrel and at the muzzle end reduced barrel wear caused by propellant gasses passing the projectile in the bore.It uses 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition, and is equipped with a telescopic sight, French army standard issue is either an APX L806 or SCROME J8 (Army) or Nightforce NXS (Air force) or Schmidt & Bender 6×42 mil-dot (Navy). The rifle is also issued as part of the FÉLIN infantry combat system outfitted with a Sagem Sword Sniper 3-in-1 optic, which serves as a <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight,</b> thermal <b>weapon</b> <b>sight,</b> and laser rangefinder. The FR F2 utilizes the same basic bolt design as the older MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy inhibiting flex in the FR F1 and FR F2.|$|R
5000|$|A thermographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sight,</b> {{thermal imagery}} scope or thermal <b>weapon</b> <b>sight</b> is a {{sighting}} device combining a compact thermographic camera and an aiming reticle. They can be {{mounted on a}} variety of small arms as well as some heavier weapons.|$|R

50|$|In November 2006, {{three new}} {{versions}} of the AN/PAS-13 were ordered by the U.S. military. The Thermal <b>Weapon</b> <b>Sights</b> II include three new versions, a Light, Medium, and Heavy. All three models weigh less than the originals, weighing 1.8 lbs, 2.8 lbs, and 3.9 lbs respectively. This reduction in weight and size is due to improvements in the sensors, {{as well as the}} ability to now run the sights without being cooled. The Medium and Heavy models maintain zooms of 5x and 10x, while the Light model has a zoom of 1.55x and a FOV of 15 degrees. All three models now run on Lithium AA batteries, with the Light having a battery life of 5 hours, the Medium 6.5, and the Heavy 6.5. The US Armed Forces designates version 2 as MTWS (Medium Thermal <b>Weapon</b> <b>Sight),</b> and version 3 as HTWS (Heavy Thermal <b>Weapon</b> <b>Sight).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> use a {{holographic}} {{image of}} a reticle at finite set range built into the viewing window and a collimated laser diode to illuminate it. An advantage to holographic sights is that they eliminate a type of parallax problem found in some optical collimator based sights (such as the red dot sight) where the spherical mirror used induces spherical aberration that can cause the reticle to skew off the sights optical axis. The use of a hologram also {{eliminates the need for}} image dimming narrow band reflective coatings and allows for reticles of almost any shape or MIL size. A downside to the holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sight</b> can be the weight and shorter battery life. As with red dot <b>sights,</b> holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> have also become common on small arms with versions like the Eotech 512.A65 and similar models fielded by the U.S. Military [...] and various law enforcement agencies.|$|R

50|$|In 2011, the Ministry of Defence began issuing ELCAN SpecterOS 4× Lightweight Day Sights (LDS) in {{an effort}} to replace ageing SUSAT units across the British Armed Forces, forming the first stage of the FIST {{infantry}} enhancement project. In order to mount the new <b>sight,</b> the <b>weapon</b> has been provided with an adapter to convert the existing sight rail to the Picatinny standard, in keeping with the updated handguard. The FIST project has also seen upgrades to the existing Qioptiq CWS (4×) and Maxi-Kite (6×) night vision scopes, and the introduction of the FIST Thermal Sight, following operational experience with the VIPIR-2+ thermal <b>weapon</b> <b>sight</b> in Afghanistan.
