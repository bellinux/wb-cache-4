5|$|Among the {{innovations}} in business {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E

25|$|In 1822, Ripley was {{a town of}} {{frequent}} street fights and shootouts where the most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was a saloon. During the Rankins' first few months there, hecklers and protesters often followed the new preacher through town and gathered outside his cabin while their first permanent home was being built just yards from the river at 220 Front Street. When the local newspaper began publishing his letters to his brother {{on the topic of}} slavery (see next section), Rankin's reputation grew among both supporters and opponents of the anti-slavery movement. Slave owners and hunters often viewed him as their prime suspect and appeared at his door at all hours demanding information about fugitives. Soon, Rankin realized that the home was too accessible a place for him to properly raise his family.|$|E
25|$|Value network {{analysis}} addresses both financial and non-financial value. Every business relationship includes contractual or mandated activities between participants — and also informal exchanges of knowledge, favors, and benefits. The analysis {{begins with a}} visual map or diagram that first shows the essential contractual, tangible revenue- or funding-related business transactions and exchanges that occur between each node of the networks. Nodes represent real people, typically individuals, groups of individuals such as a business unit or aggregates of groups such as a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in an industry network. During analysis when adopting a reflective, double loop or generative learning mode, it is beneficial to regard nodes as role plays (shortened to roles). Practitioners have found {2} that conversation between participants about role plays within a larger whole invariably results in transforming individual behaviour and gaining commitment to implementing needed change as elaborated below.|$|E

In developing what would become Standard Oil, Rockefeller, a manager of extraordinary abilities, and Flagler, an exceptional marketer, recognized that the costs {{and control of the}} shipment of crude oil would be key elements in competition with other refiners. With its combination of clever market manipulation, and hard-nosed dealings with the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), the South Improvement scheme was an example of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> tactics which Rockefeller and his associates used to become successful. Although Rockefeller became the target of many who decried Standard Oil's ruthlessness in subsequent years, the South Improvement rebate scheme was Flagler's idea.|$|E

25|$|The American Messenger Company focused {{primarily}} on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle. In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded {{for the first time}} outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.|$|E
500|$|Every adult {{woman has}} to have a close male {{relative}} as her [...] "guardian". As a result, Human Rights Watch has described the position of Saudi women as no different from being a minor, with little authority over their own lives.

These include giving approval for the woman to travel, to hold some types of business licenses, to study at a university or college and to work if the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> is not [...] "deemed appropriate for a woman."

Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled vertical monopolies called zaibatsu. The Allies dismantled the zaibatsu in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the zaibatsu were reintegrated. [...] The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, keiretsu companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well. [...] In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} extant {{appearance of}} the word in Latin literature occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the Iphigenia of Ennius, where it is contrasted to negotium. Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of otium was never a direct translation of the Greek word [...] "schole", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. Otium {{is an example of}} the usage of the term [...] "praeterpropter", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war. In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (i.e., winter months, weather not permitting war). This was associated with otium otiosum (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was otium negotiosum (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying hobby or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was otium privatum (private leisure), equal to negotium (a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Filling {{stations}} were {{essential to the}} success of a trans-national road such as Route66.

The existence of Route66, and its alignment which ran parallel to much of the Chicago–St. Louis-running Chicago and Alton Railroad, itself made gasoline distribution simpler. The earliest gas {{stations were}} curbside but these were quickly rendered obsolete because of their tendency to back up traffic when a customer used the roadside pumps. The curbside filling station was the first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> to use the actual term [...] "filling station". Other types of gas stations evolved such as the house or cottage type, the house and canopy, the house and bays, and the oblong box type. Examples of extant filling stations along Route66 in Illinois can be found in varying states of disrepair, and a few have been fully restored.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the {{business}} model is not used uniformly in the literature. Compared to the {{concept of the}} value chain, it is not limited to a physical production process. It also includes service processes. According to Timmers, [...] "a business model is defined as the organization (or architecture) of product, service and information flows, and the sources of revenues and benefits for suppliers and customers." [...] According to Wirtz, [...] "a business model is a simplified and aggregated representation of the relevant activities of a company. It describes how marketable information, products and/or services are generated by means of a company's value-added component. In addition to the architecture of value creation, strategic as well as customer and market components are considered in order to realize the overriding objective of generating and preserving a competitive advantage." [...] The business model as an integrated management tool consists of further partial models: the revenue model, the consumer model, the procurement model, the production of goods and services model, the service offer model and the distribution model. Because a business model can strongly vary depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> it can best be described using a sample. In the following the business model of a book publishing house is presented.|$|E

[...] After the fire, a new brick building was constructed at the southwest corner of Main and Cora (presently Jaycee) streets—previously the site of a livery stable that also burned. [...] The aftermath of the fire resulted in considerable change downtown. [...] Over the next 15 years, scattered houses on Main Street disappeared and were replaced by commercial buildings. [...] Only the far north end of Main Street retained its original residential character. [...] Several new businesses appeared, including several movie houses, although even before the fire, Sheridan had been proud that it possessed more than one nickelodeon. [...] Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> that seemed to thrive downtown in the interwar years was the automobile dealership, but little evidence of any of these remain. [...] The last bank of several institutions that had been established in town—the newly formed American State Bank of Sheridan—built its headquarters in 1914 at Main and Fourth. [...] It remained to house a bank until 2006. [...] Another beautiful former bank building built after the fire was the Farmers National Bank of Sheridan, now part of the adjacent hardware store. [...] Sheridan’s post office had initially been established within a general store on Second Street (the state road) east of Main Street.
