25|$|In August 1537 Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada {{entered the}} territories of the zaque, who ruled from Hunza. When the Spanish conquerors entered the {{outskirts}} of Hunza and found a hill with poles were bodies were dangling, they named it Cerro de la Horca ("Gallow Hill"). At {{the time of the}} conquest Quemuenchatocha was the zaque and he ordered his men to not submit to the European invaders or show <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to his bohío. He sent messengers to the Spanish conquistadors with valuable peace offers. While this was happening, Quemuenchatocha had hidden his treasures from the Spanish. Hunza was located in a valley not as green as the Bogotá savanna. The advantage of the Spanish weaponry {{and the use of the}} horses quickly beat the Muisca warriors.|$|E
25|$|As Hunter {{prepared}} {{to attack the}} village of Piedmont, Virginia, on June 5, Meigs suggested that cavalry be sent in a feint to take Mount Crawford overlooking the town. Sources differ {{as to whether he}} rode with or without orders, but Meigs accompanied the cavalry to show <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Lieutenant Colonel John Platner's 1st Regiment of New York Volunteer Veteran Cavalry briefly skirmished with the defenders on Mount Crawford. The feint worked as nervous Confederates held off their attack and gave Hunter time to attack. But Meigs' ride with the cavalry proved a problem as well. Hunter planned an early attack on the town as a means of keeping the Confederates off-balance. But the Confederates had burned the bridge over the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. Hunter ordered a pontoon bridge constructed. But hours passed, and no bridge was built. Hunter was angered when he realized that Meigs, the responsible officer, was off with the cavalry. It is unclear whether Meigs rushed back to his unit and quickly constructed the bridge or whether Hunter oversaw its construction himself. At any rate, the bridge was poorly constructed, and {{only a small number of}} troops could cross it at once. The delay cost the Army of the Shenandoah three critical hours and ruined its planned early-hours attack.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian {{plan of the}} Spring Campaign, {{elaborated}} by Antal Vetter, {{was that}} the 7th corps, under the lead of András Gáspár, had {{to attract the attention}} of Windisch-Grätz on his troops by making and attack from the direction of Hatvan, while the other three corps (I., II., III.) would encircle the Austrian forces from South West, and cut them from the capital cities (Pest and Buda). According to the plan, the 7th corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, than on 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at Gödöllő, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fell on the Austrians from behind, preventing them to retreat towards Pest. The key of this very risky plan was that the Austrians would not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why on the shoulder of the Hungarian commander of the VIIth Corps, András Gáspár, lied a very big responsibility to lead his troops in a way which will not betray the campaigns strategy. This meant that he had to make the enemy commander who faced him, to think that he is face to face with the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention about the I., II., and III. Hungarian corps, which in the meanwhile, were advancing towards Gödöllő from South-East. If Gáspár would have failed this task, Windsich-Grätz could been sent huge troops to destroy him, which would have been open before <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the interim Hungarian capital, Debrecen.|$|E

De Homem-Christo remarked, [...] "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we did; to make it more even as an album."

500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] is a midtempo electropop song; {{the song}} {{utilizes}} synthesizers and drum machines in its production. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the single {{is set in}} compound time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D minor and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak as the singer finds talkative men annoying; blatant come-ons such as [...] "show me where your dick's at" [...] and [...] "I wanna be naked" [...] leave this literal meaning unambiguous. Kesha herself has been frank about this straightforward interpretation of the lyrics. The lyrics have been interpreted as {{a shot at the}} way men objectify women by speaking about <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that they do in the music industry. [...] " [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH felt that the line [...] "I don't really care where you live at, just turn around boy, let me hit that. Don't be a little bitch with your chit-chat; just show me where your dick's at" [...] was a way of belittling her male peers.

500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of <b>them,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
500|$|Like Eno's {{previous}} album Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) {{received a}} mostly very positive reception from critics. Writing for the Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album {{a rating of}} A–, writing [...] "Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure. Admittedly, when they're over they're over—you don't flash on <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you do on [...] "Cindy Tells Me" [...] and [...] "Baby's on Fire". But that's just his way of being modest." [...] Wayne Robbins of Creem lauded Eno {{for the way he}} [...] "grafts seemingly disparate elements in any way that might be useful to his flow". Robbins explained, [...] "It sounds like it might be pretentious; it's not, because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions"; he concluded that [...] "a man who can write songs like 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More' has seen the future, and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno, who makes music you can live with". Circus magazine described the album as [...] "Sick! Sick! Sick! But, oh-h-h, it feels so good! [...] guaranteed to be put on the 'Most Wanted' list by psychopaths everywhere [...] takes you on a dada-ists tour-de-force, lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable". Critic Ed Naha, writing in Crawdaddy!, gave the album a negative review, writing [...] "Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno's first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell." [...] In 1975 Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) was voted one of the best albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1975.|$|E
