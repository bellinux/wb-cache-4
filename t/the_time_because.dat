5|$|He died on March 29, 1829. He {{was taken}} to the {{cemetery}} by his sons. There was no state funeral at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> Juan Lavalle made a coup against the governor Manuel Dorrego and executed him, starting a period of civil war. Lavalle was defeated by Juan Manuel de Rosas, who was appointed governor. Once he restored peace, Rosas made a state funeral for Saavedra, on January 13, 1830.|$|E
5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E
5|$|Ericsson's revolutionary turret, {{although}} not without flaws, {{was a unique}} concept in gun mounting that was soon adapted and used on naval ships around the world. His Monitor design employed over forty patented inventions and was completely {{different from any other}} naval warship at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> Monitor was an experimental craft, urgently needed, hurriedly constructed and almost immediately put to sea, a number of problems were discovered during her maiden voyage to Hampton Roads and during the battle there. Yet Monitor was still able to challenge Virginia and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads.|$|E

5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan Reeves, the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Wilfrid Laurier, the Northwest Territories seat of government was moved to Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada. This change was made when Northwest Territories defaulted back to the 1870 constitutional status after Alberta and Saskatchewan were sectioned off from the territory on September 1, 1905. After the populated regions of the territory were made into their own jurisdictions, there were very few settlements left in the territory with any significant population or infrastructure. The non-Inuit population was estimated to total around 1,000. Inuit were not counted at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> they had no status under Canadian law, and were not yet settled in towns or villages.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 {{his first}} book, How Labour Governs, was {{published}} by the London Labour Company. Examining the Australian Labor Party and its wider connection with the Australian labour movement, it reflect Childe's disillusionment with the party, believing that the politicians that it managed to get elected had abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe's biographer Sally Green noted that How Labour Governs was of particular significance at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> it was published just as the British Labour Party was emerging as {{a major player in}} British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals; in 1924 they were elected to power. Childe had planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, but it was never published.|$|E

5|$|Most historians {{state that}} Deusdedit {{died of the}} plague that was {{prevalent}} in England at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions {{the outbreak of the}} plague, the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably bubonic plague. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.|$|E
5|$|Néstor {{established}} {{a law firm}} that Cristina joined in 1979. The firm worked for banks and financial groups that filed eviction lawsuits, which had a growing rate at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> the 1050 ruling of the Central Bank had increased the interest rates for mortgage loans. The Kirchners acquired twenty-one land lots at cheap prices as {{they were about to}} be auctioned. Their law firm defended military personnel accused of committing crimes during the Dirty War. Forced disappearances were common at the time, but unlike other lawyers the Kirchners never signed a habeas corpus. Julio César Strassera, prosecutor in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas against the military, critizised the Kirchners' lack of legal actions against the military, and considered their later interest in the issue a form of hipocrisy.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E

5|$|Orisini's {{election}} was notable at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> {{it was unusual}} for the cardinals to elect friars, since they were seen by some as too rigid. Members of religious orders {{at the time were}} often respected by the cardinals, but rarely elected, with Benedict XIII being only the fourth since the Council of Trent. Unlike the other mendicants elected to the papacy in this period, he was of noble birth, being the eldest son of the Duke of Gravina, but had forfeited his rights to his father's title in order to enter the Dominicans.|$|E
5|$|Six {{miles of}} prairie was a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire. Originally {{the town was}} bounded by Palmetto, First, Jessamine, and Sixth (now Ferris) Streets. In 1910 Edward Teas, a horticulturist, moved his nursery to Bellaire from Missouri so Teas could {{implement}} Sid Hare's landscaping plans. Bellaire was incorporated as {{a city with a}} general charter in 1918, ten years after its founding. Bellaire had a population of 200 at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> of the 1918 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Bellaire's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated.|$|E
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E

5|$|The play first premiered at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on April 6, 1808. In Barker's {{letter to}} Dunlop, he writes the {{performance}} was {{done as a}} benefit for Mr. Bray (who also {{played the role of}} Walter). However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, {{it is clear that the}} performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut the performance short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who played the role of Larry, was an object of public scorn at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> of his effeminate manner and dress, and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.|$|E
5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} fire at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> {{of the threat}} to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant Sequoia trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things on Earth, are very fire-tolerant and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. Park officials set sprinklers to help protect nearby Sequoia trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, a family camp operated by the city of Berkeley, established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium {{made it hard}} to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E

5|$|Wigner led the Theoretical Group that {{included}} Creutz, Leo Ohlinger, Alvin M. Weinberg, Katharine Way and Gale Young. The group's {{task was to}} design the reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> water was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor; but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolant would delay the project. Working seven days a week, the group designed the reactors between September 1942 and January 1943. Creutz studied the corrosion of metals in a water-cooled system, and designed the cooling system. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
