500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2007 interview, Sebastian Bach claimed Rose {{had planned}} to have the album {{released}} by Christmas 2007: [...] "I know Axl was very serious about putting something out before Christmas. He was talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He was talking about finishing liner notes." [...] Bach also said that Chinese Democracys delay might be because of business problems: [...] "I think there's {{a lot of business}} shit that goes on with him. It's just not as easy. It's a little more complicated than people think." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Rose's announcement, {{the album}} was once again delayed. Rose {{recorded}} the final vocal tracks in January 2007. On February 22, 2007, the band's road manager, Del James, issued a press release definitively stating that all recording for the album had been completed. James elaborated, [...] "There is no official release date, as the band is currently mixing, but after some delays and scheduling difficulties, things appear to be moving along."

2500|$|An {{unlikely}} romance was scripted into Mel's narrative {{when she}} began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing {{has been described as}} one of [...] "the most unbelievable soap couples", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying [...] "I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all the time. I have taxi drivers telling me I could do much better than Ian. The other day someone shouted that I should go back with [...] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [...] went out with [...] a murderer than with [...] a hard-working father raising three children." [...] Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines {{in the latter part of}} 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: [...] "This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square." [...] The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revelers”.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is manifestly the {{inference}} which Augustus draws. To hear him speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> you would suppose that he suspected Annesley of having killed Mountjoy." ...|$|E
5000|$|... « When my {{daughter}} {{had a dream}} or a nightmare, the next day, I asked her <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I was taking notes then I went to my office, and I worked. » ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Colesworthy enfolded {{her in an}} approbatory embrace, {{and hurried}} home <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "There now!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "didn't I say that Lilian Budworth was a girl of good, sound common-sense?" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{my friends}} in the town, and those at the school, heard that Rectus and I were going off together, they thought it an uncommonly good joke, and they crowded up to our house <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He stared a moment, taken aback. [...] "Good God! Ye don't say so, child! Her brother! O'Moy's brother-in-law! And O'Moy {{never said}} a word <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' replied Merry. 'Nobody {{ever said}} {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If any one {{had tried to}} make me have him, I wouldn't have had him at all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you seem}} to preach <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> What can I do for the girl? The fact is, he don't care for her a bit, and never did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, as {{you have}} asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell you my story, I will make short work of it, and then I {{would like to hear}} what has {{happened}} to you, as much as you please <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} smell a {{dramatic}} rat and begged him <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Don Sebastian, [...] "this is interesting, and as I know {{something}} of the intrigues that {{go on in the}} city it might be to your advantage <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> There is a quiet wine-shop not far off." ...|$|R

6000|$|Seating herself [...] "for ten minutes," [...] she said: [...] "By the way, Mr. Denham {{told me he}} {{was going}} to give up the Bar and live in the country. Has he gone? He was {{beginning}} <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> when we were interrupted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shadow, {{you are in}} {{some deep}} trouble, I know it," [...] came bluntly from Dave. [...] "Don't you want <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> I'll do what I can for you. We've been chums ever since I came here and I hate to see you so downcast." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} working {{steadily}} at Portuguese, Terence, ever since you spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> One has no end of time on one's hands and, really, I am getting on very fairly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the least idea. I {{never heard of the}} {{existence}} of the mortgage until Brander wrote <b>to</b> <b>me</b> himself <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at the time he bought the estate; but he gave me an explanation that perfectly satisfied me at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, why did {{you sell}} her {{without saying a word}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> your intention? <b>It</b> was very, very, very unkind--indeed it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it was {{something}} that she said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> you. But <b>it's</b> the same thing. It makes no difference. I ask you not to go for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{awfully good}} of him," [...] Wilfrid said, [...] "and {{he never said}} a word <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Where is he?" [...] and he looked round. But Mr. Atherton had disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are giving}} a grand supper-party for Gorla {{on the night}} of her debut, aren't you?" [...] she asked Cicely; [...] "several people spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so I suppose it must be true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure it's {{impossible}} for me to say what my sister may, or may not have thought on such a subject,' cried Cherry. 'She never said anything <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> one way or other.' ...|$|E

60|$|Then at my {{invitation}} he {{sat down}} <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> One morning when he came the young had just come off, and he found one squatting on the ground under the trees, looking stupefied.
