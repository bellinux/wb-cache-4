5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics <b>textbook</b> for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's <b>textbook</b> was not reprinted.|$|E
5|$|Holmboe {{published}} his first <b>textbook</b> in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (<b>Textbook</b> in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (<b>Textbook</b> in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the level of allocation of human rights issues – rights, freedom, democracy, justice, tolerance and peace – in mother tongue <b>textbooks</b> in Turkey and France. For this aim, ten mother tongue <b>textbooks</b> from both countries were examined. Content analysis method was used to analyse the <b>textbooks.</b> As a result, it was observed that human rights issues are included more in Turkish <b>textbooks</b> when compared to French <b>textbooks.</b> It was found that in the <b>textbooks</b> of both countries the ‘rights’ subcategory is included the most while the ‘justice’ subcategory is included the least. While the intensity scores of the ‘democracy’ and ‘freedom’ subcategories were listed toward the very end in the <b>textbooks</b> of both countries, the ‘democracy’ subcategory occupies more places in French <b>textbooks</b> whereas the ‘freedom’ subcategory occupies more places in Turkish <b>textbooks.</b> Besides, the intensity scores for the subcategories of ‘rights’, ‘peace’ and ‘tolerance’ hold the first three places in the mother tongue <b>textbooks</b> of both countries. peer-reviewe...|$|R

With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E

One strand is developed by teachers of psychology—first as a general approach for investigating <b>textbooks</b> in a pedagogical setting, and then later upgraded into a full history of psychology <b>textbooks</b> in America. The other strand follows a more familiar perspective of historians of science and historians of psychology who build on various post-Kuhnian and post-Foucauldian perspectives on <b>textbooks.</b> I make an argument for integrating these two views for a more comprehensive historiography of <b>textbooks</b> in psychology, recasting <b>textbooks</b> as objects of research and sources that are interesting sui generis for historians of psychology in their investigations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Textbooks</b> have an {{important}} meaning for teachers. Â Textbooks {{can serve as a}} source of learning and teaching history, because in it there is material, illustrations, and a variety of evaluation, so that learning objectives can be achieved in an optimal history. Â The first selection of <b>textbooks</b> criteria is based on the relevance of the material contained in a text book with the structure of the curriculum. Â The next criterion is completeness of the material, number of illustrations, and a diverse training and evaluation. Â In learning history, {{there are two types of}} utilization of <b>textbooks,</b> namely the use of <b>textbooks</b> that students already have the book and the use of <b>textbooks</b> to students who do not have.
