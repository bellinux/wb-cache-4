Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> responsibility for it. I have a really hard time {{with that kind of}} thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.'

However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> responsibility for it. I have a really hard time {{with that kind of}} thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it."

We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater."

I have a really hard time {{with that kind of}} thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." [...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like." [...] The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from [...] "the old show". However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the Buzzsugar review.|$|E

Chang also noted the little screen time of characters Mark Sloan and Richard Webber, and the lack of romantic development in their storylines. Many critics negatively reviewed Izzie Stevens's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George. Katherine Heigl herself deemed their relationship [...] "a ratings ploy".

[...] Laura Burrows of IGN stated the series became [...] "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic" [...] in its fourth season. She also said that [...] "this season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." [...] However, the episode [...] "Physical Attraction, Chemical Reaction" [...] received a positive review, with Burrows stating that it [...] "fully encompassed all the things that make this show great: intense emotional drama and macabre OR activities". The Derek/Rose relationship received negative reviews, with Burrows stating that it was [...] "emotional, but not remarkable". Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters, stating that their behaviour is the show's biggest problem: [...] "the self-absorbed, pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey’s exasperate more than reward." [...] As for the storylines, Foley stated that they didn't [...] "ring true" [...] and that [...] "the plot devices became increasingly clunky", noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie's marriage and the Izzie's affair [...] "as a means of ripping it apart". Florrey also commented on Meredith Grey's arc, by stating that she turned into [...] "one of the most selfish, self-centered characters on television", whereas Mark Sloan's storyline was named [...] "sex-obsessed, borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said [...] "One of the season's best performances came from Emmy-nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser." [...] Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser's performance by stating that it [...] "has been one of the only good things that show's had going for it anymore."
