5|$|Since Kenya and Ethiopia had {{the same}} {{statistics}} {{at the end of}} the group stage, a coin toss was used as <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> lots to determine the winner of Group A.|$|E
5|$|The final {{part of the}} {{ceremony}} was marked with <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> lots. It was assisted by Vladimir Kramnik and Hou Yifan as the highest-rated players of the highest-ranked teams in the open and women's event, respectively, who joined the Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov for <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> colours. The draw resulted in Hou picking the White pieces, meaning that all players in the women's section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will be White in the first round; and Kramnik picking the Black pieces, meaning that all players in the open section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will have the Black pieces in the opening round.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} years, {{the running}} order was not decided by <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> lots, but instead by the producers, {{with the aim}} of making the shows more exciting and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out. The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.|$|E

5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|The {{panorama}} on the Library punchbowl {{begins with}} a view of the eastern shore of Sydney Cove. In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. <b>The</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left of the house is a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand. Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{maps are}} used to display {{information}} quickly showing the analysis of various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E

5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E

25|$|These are {{intended}} for measuring spatial ability in children. With this test, an experimenter presents the participant with a drawing of a maze {{with a picture of}} a man in the centre. While the participant watches, the experimenter uses his or her finger to trace a pathway from the opening of the maze to <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the man. The participant is then expected to replicate the demonstrated pathway through the maze to <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the man. Mazes vary in complexity as difficulty increases.|$|E

25|$|In Islam, {{although}} {{nothing in}} the Quran explicitly bans images, some supplemental hadith explicitly ban <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or any other prophet such as Moses or Abraham.|$|E
25|$|Although Clark was {{refused a}} {{promotion}} {{to the rank}} of captain when Jefferson asked the Senate to appoint him, at Lewis' insistence, he exercised equal authority, and continued the mission. Clark concentrated chiefly on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> maps, the management of the expedition's supplies, and leading hunting expeditions for game.|$|E
25|$|The social, {{communicative}} {{practice of}} argumentation {{can and should}} be distinguished from implication (or entailment)—a relationship between propositions; and from inference—a mental activity typically thought of as <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> a conclusion from premises. Informal logic may thus be said to be a logic of argumentation, as distinguished from implication and inference.|$|E
