5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
5|$|Spurs remade for CharlesII {{are taken}} from the altar and {{presented}} to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Known originally as StGeorge's Spurs, {{they are one of}} the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Gold spurs were introduced into the coronation ceremony in 1189 at the coronation of RichardI. Historically, the spurs were fastened to the monarch's feet but since the Restoration <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens and placed on the altar.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
60|$|Effenden Pascha {{was clear}} on both points. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> {{a party of}} {{surveyors}} accompanied by a few soldiers. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> set upon without the slightest warning.|$|R
25|$|Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, top presidential aides, {{were arrested}} for abuse of power and helping Choi; they denied {{wrongdoing}} and claimed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> following President Park's orders.|$|R
50|$|Other witch towers were, however, named later, {{for example}} in the 19th century when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> used as normal prisons or were just {{ordinary}} towers in the city walls.|$|R
25|$|Multidimensional {{variants}} {{of the various}} DCT types follow straightforwardly from the one-dimensional definitions: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> a separable product (equivalently, a composition) of DCTs along each dimension.|$|E
25|$|The other moons of Pluto, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx, {{orbit the}} same barycenter, {{but they are}} not large enough to be spherical, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> {{considered}} to be satellites of Pluto (or of Pluto–Charon).|$|E
25|$|Note: All above listed are {{specified}} by JEDEC as JESD79F. All RAM data rates in-between or above these listed specifications are not standardized by JEDEC—often <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> manufacturer optimizations using tighter-tolerance or overvolted chips.|$|E
5000|$|The Visayan pygmy babbler was {{formerly}} included {{here as a}} subspecies, but is usually recognized as a distinct species S. pygmaea today. Together, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> called [...] "pygmy babbler".|$|R
25|$|The Sherman Antitrust Act {{prohibits the}} {{restraint}} of trade. Defenders of Standard Oil {{insist that the}} company did not restrain trade; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> superior competitors. The federal courts ruled otherwise.|$|R
50|$|ObexFS is a FUSE-based {{filesystem}} {{that provides}} access to OBEX objects via a filesystem. Applications can work on remote objects via the OBEX protocol as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> (local) files.|$|R
25|$|Other {{populations in}} the Altamaha, Mississippi and St. Lawrence River basins have not been studied yet {{with respect to their}} {{specific}} genetic make-up, and so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> named as being part of the Viviparus georgianus species complex.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} manifestations of {{hydraulic}} jumps and historically different terminology {{has been used for}} each. However, the mechanisms behind them are similar because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> variations of each other seen from different frames of reference, and so the physics and analysis techniques can be used for both types.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to professional uses where accurate time is required, radio-controlled clocks with both digital and analog displays using the NPL signal {{are widely used}} (similar clocks are available in other regions with standard time transmissions). As far as users are concerned <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> clocks with the same features and settings as others, but always display the right time, and correct themselves for summer time.|$|E
5000|$|Christine & Steven are {{citizens}} of , {{but in the}} program <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> stated to <b>be</b> Chinese as the People's Republic of China does not recognize the Republic of China's statehood.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} {{parks in the}} Norwayne subdivision. Before 1958, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> vacant lots, but the {{township}} acquired the lots and cleaned them up. The parks include picnic pavilions and playground equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Regional councils {{were created}} by law on 5 July 1972. Originally <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> consultative bodies {{consisting}} of the region's parliamentary representatives plus {{an equal number of}} members nominated by the departments and municipalities.|$|R
25|$|In America, {{not only}} do U.S. {{students}} receive sex education within school or religious programs, {{but they are also}} educated by their parents. American parents are less prone to influencing their children's actual sexual experiences than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> telling their children what they should not do. They promote abstinence while educating their children with things that may make their adolescents not want to engage in sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{environmental}} groups have criticized Earth Island Institute’s support of U.S. policies {{that do not}} require independent, on-board observation and instead only rely on self-certification by fishing captains, and that even where they may {{at some point in the}} future require independent observers, the lack of uniformity in tracing and verifying certifications in different countries means non-certified products can become certified if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> taken to the right port.|$|E
25|$|Drew Davis (seasons 1–2 & 4) and Millie Davis (seasons 1–5) as Oscar and Gemma Hendrix, Alison's and Donnie's adopted kids. As of Season 3, {{they are}} aware of the clones, but think <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> Alison's sisters. Gemma has a knack for showing up at awkward moments, such as when Sarah (dressed as Alison) was trying to keep Paul from killing Vic, when her parents were burying Dr. Leekie's body, and when Alison and Donnie were having some time to themselves.|$|E
6000|$|He {{saw with}} the last vividness, {{and it was as}} if, in their silences, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> so leaving what he saw. [...] "She doesn't speak at all? I don't mean not of me." ...|$|R

50|$|Messina, Lipara, {{and perhaps}} Lilybaeum, Agregentum, and Halaesa were made into municipia - a status {{significantly}} {{lower than that of}} colonia. No veterans were settled in these settlements; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> compensated for their loyalty by Augustus.|$|R
25|$|The {{semantics}} of formulaic language {{have often}} been debated on, and to date, there lacks a consensus {{on whether or not}} filler words are intentional in speech {{and whether or not they}} should be considered as words or if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> side effects of difficulties in the planning process of speech by speakers. Bailey & Ferriera's (2007) paper found that there is little evidence to suggest that the use of filler words are intentional in speech and that they should not be considered as words in the conventional sense.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{notion is}} that people might not share {{extremely}} intense emotional events because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> inexpressible. Along with this idea, psychologists initially hypothesized that the extreme nature of such experiences would {{play an important role}} in determining whether an emotional event is shared or not. Additionally, they thought that people would be motivated not to deliberately revisit such events because they would reactivate the extreme negative emotions that accompanied the events. However, their studies revealed that there was no difference in the average emotional intensity between events that were shared compared to those that were kept secret.|$|E
25|$|Since a team {{almost always}} scores fewer {{runs in a}} {{baseball}} game than its number of outs, a baserunner will frequently take risks attempting to advance an extra base or to score a run, resulting in close plays at a base. In cricket, since the number of runs scored {{is much greater than}} the number of wickets taken in a match, a batsman would be very foolish to risk getting run out in an attempt to score an extra run without a very high expected chance of success. In general, cricket batsmen are run out due to exceptional fielding, poor judgment/communication, or a combination of said factors. In baseball, runners are often out not of their own accord – <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> forced out.|$|E
50|$|The junta {{was accused}} of intimidating Thai Rak Thai {{politicians}} and pressuring them to cease political activities. They also threatened that the party would be dissolved. The junta claimed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> seeking cooperation from politicians.|$|R

50|$|In 1961, Llewellyn Worldwide, an {{independent}} publisher of {{books for the}} New Age, Pagan, and Occult audience was moved to Saint Paul by the new owner Carl L. Weschcke. At the time <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> an astrological publisher.|$|R
25|$|After {{waking up}} back in the {{research}} station, however, the Doctor deduces that they haven't truly woken up – <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> in a different layer of a multi-faceted dream and have been since the initial attack when they arrived. In reality, none of them actually escaped it. The Doctor proves this by having the scientists individually read copies of the base's manual that each had been issued. They find that the first word of any chosen page is different for each of them, rather than identical as it should be. The Doctor further explains that the Dream Crabs could not stop their subconscious minds from fighting back, which manifested {{in the form of}} Santa Claus. Santa himself clarifies the entire situation to the group, and he aids them in waking up.|$|E
25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> too far apart for {{meaningful}} two-way communication. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E
25|$|Task Review - The losing {{team are}} {{subjected}} to a more detailed, extensive review of their performance in the boardroom, with Lord Sugar and his advisers being more openly critical of any team member's performance on the task, particularly those who performed poorly or contributed very little, while candidates argue their case for staying in the competition, often highlighting others in their team and countering any criticism they receive that they feel is unfounded. Once discussions are brought to an end, the team's project manager for the task is asked to select two candidates from their team to accompany them into for a final boardroom discussion, {{with the power of}} their choice meaning that anyone can be selected, whether they were responsible for the failure of the task or considered to be by the PM, or are someone whom the PM has issues with such as personality clashes. Those not picked are sent back to the candidates' accommodation for that series, while Sugar and his advisers have a private discussion amongst themselves about the PM and their choices after the group are told to wait outside the boardroom; if the team only consists of two or three candidates, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> told to step outside {{at the end of the}} team's discussion period.|$|E
5000|$|The parents, {{along with}} the US {{president}} (Jim Backus), pay the children a visit. They reveal themselves to be well-behaved and intelligent, explaining that they acted [...] "stupid" [...] around the servants because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> emulating them.|$|R
5000|$|He {{discovered}} two moons of Jupiter, today {{known as}} Himalia (on Dec 3, 1904) and Elara (in 1905). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> designated [...] "Jupiter VI" [...] and [...] "Jupiter VII" [...] {{and were not}} given their present names until 1975.|$|R
50|$|Calling code {{areas in}} Serbia {{have been largely}} {{unchanged}} {{since the time of}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
