5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley AVA is {{the wine}} growing region that {{encompasses}} <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley. It stretches from the Columbia River {{in the north}} to just south of Eugene in the south, where <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley ends; and from the Oregon Coast Range in the West to the Cascade Mountains in the East. At , {{it is the largest}} AVA in the state, and contains most of the state's wineries; with 545 as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Neighboring {{watersheds}} on {{the east}} side of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River include Mount Scott Creek and Kellogg Creek, which flow through Milwaukie and drain directly into the Willamette; the Clackamas River, which drains the southeast suburbs and empties into <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> near Oregon City; the Sandy River, which drains the eastern suburbs and empties into the Columbia; and Fairview Creek and the Columbia Slough, which drain north Portland and Gresham, emptying into the Columbia.|$|E
5|$|West Linn, to the west, is {{delineated}} by <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 20 major dams on <b>the</b> <b>Willamette's</b> tributaries, {{as well as a}} complex series of levees, dikes, and {{channels}} to control the river's flow.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Upper <b>Willamette</b> Transportation Line {{was a line}} of four inland steamboats that {{operated}} {{from the}} fall of 1859 to the summer of 1860 on <b>the</b> upper <b>Willamette</b> River in <b>the</b> state of Oregon.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> upper <b>Willamette</b> River is {{much longer}} than <b>the</b> lower <b>Willamette.</b> <b>The</b> {{division}} between the two stretches of the river occurs at Willamette Falls, which was impassable to waterborne traffic. All cargoes bound further south than Oregon City had to be unloaded, portaged around the falls, and loaded again on vessels above the falls. For commercial purposes, <b>the</b> upper <b>Willamette</b> ran from above the falls {{to the head of}} navigation, and included important tributary rivers such as the Tualatin and the Yamhill. In the early 1850s the head of navigation was considered to be Corvallis, then known as Marysville.|$|R
5|$|Willamette Law Review {{began in}} 1959, with four editions {{published}} each year. This general interest legal review also sponsors an annual symposium at the school. The first journal on sports {{law in the}} Pacific Northwest was <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Sports Law Journal. The inaugural edition of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Environmental Law Journal was published in summer 2012. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Journal of Social Justice and Equity, the only journal {{of its kind in}} Oregon, was established in 2017, with its first issue expected in winter 2017.|$|E
5|$|Willamette's College of Law also {{produces}} <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Lawyer and Willamette Law Online. <b>The</b> <b>Willamette</b> Lawyer is the school’s alumni magazine, published once {{annually in the}} fall. Produced primarily by students, Willamette Law Online is a subscription service that provides case summaries free to legal professionals in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|About 2.5million {{people lived}} in <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River basin as of 2010, about 65percent of the {{population}} of Oregon. As of 2009, the basin contained 20 of the 25 most populous cities in Oregon. These cities include Springfield, Eugene, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, Keizer, Newberg, Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, Lake Oswego, and Portland. The largest is Portland, with more than 500,000 residents. Not all of these cities draw water directly from <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> for their municipal water supply. Other cities in the watershed (but not on the main-stem river) with populations of 20,000 or more are Gresham, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Tigard, McMinnville, Tualatin, Woodburn, and Forest Grove.|$|E

5|$|The dams on <b>the</b> <b>Willamette's</b> major tributaries are {{primarily}} large flood-control, water storage, and power-generating dams. Thirteen of these dams were built from the 1940s through the 1960s {{to be operated}} by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and 11 of those produce hydropower. Flood-control dams operated by the USACE are estimated to hold up to 27percent of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette's</b> runoff. They are used to regulate river flows so as to cut peaks off floods and increase low flows in late summer and autumn, and to divert water into deeper, narrower channels to prevent flooding. In addition, a relatively small of amount of the water stored in the reservoirs is used for irrigation.|$|R

5|$|Adjacent to the Columbia Slough basin are the {{watersheds}} of the Sandy River to the east, Johnson Creek to {{the south}}, <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> {{to the south}} and west, and the Columbia to the north. Lying slightly north of the watershed, large islands in the Columbia River include, from east to west, McGuire Island, Government Island, Lemon Island, and Tomahawk Island, which is connected to Hayden Island. Bordered by the Columbia and two arms of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette,</b> Sauvie Island lies just west of the mouth of the slough.|$|E
5|$|Another such ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, located near <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, {{when the same}} great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E
5|$|As {{commerce}} and industry flourished {{on the lower}} river, most of the original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops {{on most of the}} available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River led the Oregon state government to remove the natives by military force. They were first led off their traditional lands to <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley, but soon were marched to the Coast Indian Reservation. In 1855, Joel Palmer, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the government to a part of the Coast Reservation that later became the Grande Ronde Reservation.|$|E

5|$|Freight rail {{service is}} {{provided}} by the Portland and Western Railroad over the same tracks as WES, with connections to BNSF Railway. These tracks run north-south and cross <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> over the Portland and Western Railroad Bridge. The city does not have an airport, with Aurora State Airport to the south as the closest public field and Portland International Airport 17 miles north as the closest commercial airport. Although located along the river, there are not any port facilities, though there is a marina located on the eastbank (south side) of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{traveled}} {{thousands of}} miles across central North America {{in an attempt to}} map and explore the Louisiana Territory of the United States and the Oregon Country, which were then occupied mainly by Native Americans and settlers from Great Britain. As the expedition traveled down and back up the Columbia River, it missed the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette,</b> one of the Columbia's largest tributaries. It was only after receiving directions from natives along the Sandy River that the explorers learned about their oversight. William Clark returned down the Columbia and entered <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River in April 1806. The United States Exploring Expedition passed through <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley in 1841 while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail. The expedition members noted extensive salmon fishing by natives at Willamette Falls, much like that at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, a private American ship {{became the first}} {{non-indigenous}} vessel to enter the river; {{it was followed by}} a British explorer, who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley. In the following decades, fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley through the scenic but treacherous Columbia River Gorge, and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers. Steamships along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.|$|E
50|$|Dayton was {{operated}} on <b>the</b> upper <b>Willamette</b> River (from Willamette Falls upstream {{to the head}} of navigation at Eugene City), and the Yamhill River until 1875. After that the steamer was transferred to <b>the</b> lower <b>Willamette</b> and Columbia rivers, where it served until about 1881.|$|R

Other wildlife includes painted turtles, frogs, salamanders, crawfish, fish, and alligator lizards. The refuge is one of only ten national wildlife refuges in the United States located in an urban area. Groups have suggested that the refuge be expanded all the way to <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River to provide a greenway through a heavily populated area. The Tualatin's floodplain is the largest of any of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River’s tributaries.|$|E
5|$|The College of Law {{produces}} five publications, {{including six}} law reviews. In 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Journal of International Law and Dispute Resolution began publication {{with a focus}} on dispute resolution and the law on the international level.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} {{is found in}} <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley and the {{drainage}} areas of the Yamhill River and other tributaries of <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> River.

5|$|Around {{the year}} 1850, the Kalapuya {{numbered}} between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; {{there may have}} been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on <b>the</b> <b>Willamette.</b> The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both {{the north and the south}} side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in <b>the</b> <b>Willamette</b> Valley. The total native population was estimated at about 15,000.|$|E
