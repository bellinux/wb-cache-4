5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the Republican party, to support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> dry laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E

25|$|In the November 1860 Presidential election, Kentucky voters gave native Kentuckian Abraham Lincoln {{less than}} one percent of the vote. Kentuckians did not like Lincoln, because he stood for the {{eradication}} of slavery and his Republican Party aligned itself with the North. But, neither did <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> native son John C. Breckinridge and his Southern Democratic Party, generally regarded as secessionists. In 1860, people in the state held 225,000 slaves, with Louisville's slaves comprising 7.5 percent of the population. The voters wanted both to keep slavery and stay in the Union.|$|E

25|$|The series also sidesteps {{issues of}} {{stereotyping}} by having characters {{in both the}} Muslim and non-Muslim communities who cross the entire spectrum of political opinion. Baber and Fatima, who represent conservative views within Islam, are balanced by conservative radio host Fred Tupper among the non-Muslims, while Amaar and Rayyan, who represent Islamic liberalism, are balanced by the liberal Anglican Rev. Magee. The more moderate Yasir and Sarah, who try to be good Muslims but aren't particularly strongly defined by their faith, are balanced among the non-Muslims by Mayor Popowicz, who doesn't care what anybody's religious beliefs are as long as <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> her on election day.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{aggregate}} national popular vote is calculated by state officials, media organizations, and the Federal Election Commission, the people only indirectly elect the president, {{as the national}} popular vote is not the basis for electing the president or vice president. The {{president and vice president}} of the United States are elected by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 presidential electors from the fifty states and Washington, D.C. Presidential electors are selected on a state-by-state basis, as determined by the laws of each state. Since the election of 1824, most states have appointed their electors on a winner-take-all basis, based on the statewide popular vote on Election Day. Maine and Nebraska are the only two current exceptions, as both states use the congressional district method. Although ballots list the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates (who run on a ticket), voters actually choose electors when <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> president and vice president. These presidential electors in turn cast electoral votes for those two offices. Electors usually pledge to vote for their party's nominee, but some [...] "faithless electors" [...] have voted for other candidates or refrained from voting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first season}} of the Philippine edition used three {{different}} formats of the Yield. Aside from the original U.S. format, the Israeli format of having teams vote {{at the start of}} the next Leg was used, known as the [...] "Forced Yield". The third format to be used which debuted on the Philippine version of the show was the [...] "Anonymous Yield", where the team who chooses to Yield another team does not have to reveal their identity. This format was adapted from the [...] "Blind/Anonymous U-Turn". For the second season, the format used in the entire race was more akin to that of the Israeli format as Yields (or U-Turns) would appear in almost every leg and teams would cast their vote at the [...] "Voting Board" [...] sometime during the leg instead of at the beginning. Differing from the Israeli version, however, is that teams are only asked who they want to delay and are not aware if the team <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> will either be Yielded or U-Turned. They will only know this by the warning on the clue prior to the [...] "Reveal Board".|$|E

5000|$|The {{polarization}} {{has been}} present {{for only two}} close elections (2000 and 2004). In the 1996 election, 31 U.S. states were [...] "blue" [...] (i.e., <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Democrat Bill Clinton) and 19 [...] "red" [...] (i.e., <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Republican Bob Dole) (though {{at the time the}} current color scheme was not as universal as today). One trend that has been true for several election cycles is that states that vote Republican tend to be more rural and more sparsely populated (thus having fewer electoral votes) than states that vote Democratic.|$|R

60|$|Mount Vernon, Washington's own residence, stands close {{over the}} Potomac, about six miles below Alexandria. It will be {{understood}} that the capital is on the eastern, or Maryland side of the river, and that Arlington Heights, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon are in Virginia. The River Potomac divided the two old colonies, or States as they afterward became; but when Washington was to be built, a territory, said to be ten miles square, was {{cut out of the}} two States and was called the District of Columbia. The greater portion of this district was taken from Maryland, and on that the city was built. It comprised the pleasant town of Georgetown, which is now a suburb--and the only suburb--of Washington. The portion of the district on the Virginian side included Arlington heights, and went so far down the river as to take in the Virginian City of Alexandria. This was the extreme western point of the district; but since that arrangement was made, the State of Virginia petitioned to have their portion of Columbia back again, and this petition was granted. Now it is felt that the land {{on both sides of the}} river should belong to the city, and the government is anxious to get back the Virginian section. The city and the immediate vicinity are freed from all State allegiance, and are under the immediate rule of the United States government--having of course its own municipality; but the inhabitants have no political power, as power is counted in the States. <b>They</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> no political officer, not even for the President, and return no member to Congress, either as a senator or as a Representative. Mount Vernon was never within the District of Columbia.|$|E
60|$|I am {{speaking}} of the men visitors; the intellectual light of the women visitors, whatever it was, was much dispersed and intercepted by the screen behind which they were placed. I {{do not know why}} the women should be thus obscured, for, if the minds of members were in danger of being distracted by their presence, I should think they would be still more distracted when the element of mystery was added to it by the grille. Seen across the whole length of the House from the men's gallery the women looked as if tightly pressed against the grille, and had a curiously thin, phantasmal effect, or the effect of frescoed figures done very flat. To the imaginative spectator their state might have symbolized the relation of women to Parliamentary politics, of which we read much in English novels, and even English newspapers. Women take much more interest in political affairs in England than with us; that is well known; {{but it may not be}} so well known that they are in much greater enjoyment of the franchise, if the franchise is indeed a pleasure. I do not know whether <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> school-committeemen, or whether there are school-committeemen for them to vote for; but they may vote for guardians of the poor, and may themselves be voted for to that office; and they may vote for members of the Urban Councils and the County Councils if they have property to be taxed by those bodies. This is the right for which our Revolution was made, though we continue, with regard to women, the Georgian heresy of taxation without representation; but it is doubtful to the barbarian whether good can come of women's mixing in parliamentary elections at which they have no vote. Of course, with us a like interference would be taken jocosely, ironically; it would, at the bottom, be a good joke, amusing from the tendency of the feminine temperament to acts of circus in moments of high excitement; but whether the Englishmen regard it so, the English, alone know. They are much more serious than we, and perhaps they take it as a fit manifestation of the family principle which is the underlying force of the British Constitution. One heard of ladies who were stumping (or whatever is the English equivalent of stumping) the country on the preferential tariff question and the other questions which divide Conservatives and Liberals; but in spite of these examples of their proficiency the doubt remained whether those who have not the suffrage can profitably attempt to influence it. Till women can make up their minds to demand and accept its responsibilities, possibly they will do best to let it alone.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} unity was the {{constant}} {{theme of the}} campaign fought by the CEDA and the election was presented as a confrontation of ideas, not of personalities.

The fortunes of Republican Spain, {{according to one of}} its posters had been decided by 'immorality and anarchy'. Catholics who continued to proclaim their republicanism were moved into the revolutionary camp and many speeches argued that the Catholic republican option had become totally illegitimate. 'A good Catholic may not <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Conservative Republican party' declared a Gaceta Regional editorial and the impression was given that Conservative Republicans, far from being Catholics, were in fact anti-religious.|$|R
