25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{are not able to}} proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with <b>transdifferentiation.</b> <b>Transdifferentiation</b> of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E
2500|$|The body {{contains}} {{a variety of}} stem cell types that {{have the capacity to}} differentiate into neurons. A report in Nature suggested that researchers had found a way to transform human skin cells into working nerve cells using a process called <b>transdifferentiation</b> in which [...] "cells are forced to adopt new identities".|$|E
2500|$|Turritopsis dohrnii, or Turritopsis nutricula, {{is a small}} (...) {{species of}} {{jellyfish}} that uses <b>transdifferentiation</b> to replenish cells after sexual reproduction. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. This organism originated in the Caribbean sea, but has now spread around the world. Similar cases include hydrozoan Laodicea undulata and scyphozoan Aurelia sp.1.|$|E
2500|$|... "Strategies {{include the}} {{rearrangement}} of pre-existing tissue, {{the use of}} adult somatic stem cells and the dedifferentiation and/or <b>transdifferentiation</b> of cells, {{and more than one}} mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal. All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form." [...] During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of cell as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a blastema, which is [...] "a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins." [...] Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This {{should not be confused with}} the [...] <b>transdifferentiation</b> of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.|$|E
2500|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} {{adult stem cells}} {{is the focus of}} much scientific research, due to their ability to be harvested from the patient. In common with embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells have the ability to differentiate into more than one cell type, but unlike the former they are often restricted to certain types or [...] "lineages". The ability of a differentiated stem cell of one lineage to produce cells of a different lineage is called <b>transdifferentiation.</b> Some types of adult stem cells are more capable of <b>transdifferentiation</b> than others, but for many {{there is no evidence that}} such a transformation is possible. Consequently, adult stem therapies require a stem cell source of the specific lineage needed, and harvesting and/or culturing them up to the numbers required is a challenge. [...] Additionally, cues from the immediate environment (including how stiff or porous the surrounding structure/extracellular matrix is) can alter or enhance the fate [...] and differentiation of the stem cells.|$|E
2500|$|Discoveries {{in recent}} years have {{suggested}} that adult stem cells might have the ability to differentiate into cell types from different germ layers. For instance, neural stem cells from the brain, which are derived from ectoderm, can differentiate into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Stem cells from the bone marrow, which is derived from mesoderm, can differentiate into liver, lung, GI tract and skin, which are derived from endoderm and mesoderm. This phenomenon is referred to as stem cell <b>transdifferentiation</b> or plasticity. It can be induced by modifying the growth medium when stem cells are cultured in vitro or transplanting them to an organ of the body different from the one they were originally isolated from. There is yet no consensus among biologists on the prevalence and physiological and therapeutic relevance of stem cell plasticity. More recent findings suggest that pluripotent stem cells may reside in blood and adult tissues in a dormant state. These cells are referred to as [...] "Blastomere Like Stem Cells" [...] (Am Surg. 2007 Nov;73:1106-10) and [...] "very small embryonic like" [...] â€“ [...] "VSEL" [...] stem cells, and display pluripotency in vitro. As BLSC's and VSEL cells are present in virtually all adult tissues, including lung, brain, kidneys, muscles, and pancreas Co-purification of BLSC's and VSEL cells with other populations of adult stem cells may explain the apparent pluripotency of adult stem cell populations. However, recent studies have shown that both human and murine VSEL cells lack stem cell characteristics and are not pluripotent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transdifferentiation</b> of MSCs into excitable neuron-like cells {{has been}} shown to be {{possible}} in vitro and these cells respond to common central nervous system neurotransmitters. However, it is unlikely that this degree of <b>transdifferentiation</b> occurs in vivo and that <1% of injected MSCs become truly differentiated and integrate in the damaged area. This suggests that <b>transdifferentiation</b> of MSCs into neurons or neuron-like cells is not a major mechanism by which MSCs cause neurorestoration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Transdifferentiation,</b> {{also known}} as lineage reprogramming, is {{a process in which}} one mature somatic cell {{transforms}} into another mature somatic cell without undergoing an intermediate pluripotent state or progenitor cell type. It is a type of metaplasia, which includes all cell fate switches, including the interconversion of stem cells. Current uses of <b>transdifferentiation</b> include disease modeling and drug discovery and in the future may include gene therapy and regenerative medicine. The term 'transdifferentiation' was originally coined by Selman and Kafatos in 1974 to describe a change in cell properties as cuticle producing cells became salt-secreting cells in silk moths undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E

50|$|Pluripotent {{cells are}} capable of {{self-renewal}} and often go through many cell passages, which increases the chance of accumulating mutations.

[...] These stem cells differentiate into mucous neck cells in the isthmus and transition into chief cells as they migrate towards the base. Since the mucus neck cells do not divide as it becomes a chief cell this process is known as <b>transdifferentiation.</b> The gene Mist1 has been shown to regulate mucus neck cell to chief cell <b>transdifferentiation</b> and plays a role in the normal development of the chief cell organelles and structures.|$|E
