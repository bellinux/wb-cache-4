40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a quantum}} optical heating mechanism which might {{play an important}} role in sonoluminescence experiments. We suggest that this mechanism occurs during the final stages of the bubble collapse phase and accompanies the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> due to the compression of the bubble. More concretely, it is shown that a weak but highly inhomogeneous electric field, as it occurs naturally during rapid bubble deformations, can increase the temperature of strongly confined particles by several orders of magnitude on a nanosecond time scale [A. Kurcz et al., New J. Phys. 11, 053001 (2009) ]. Our model suggests that it is possible to control sonoluminescence experiments in ionic liquids with the help of appropriately detuned laser fields.

This {{dissertation}} work {{deals with}} {{problems associated with}} the appropriate <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> installation in the building objects in relation to final building energy intensity and installed heat pump running economy. The work also pro po sed the solution of the heat pumps design and their utilization in the buildings in dependence on the installed capacity, the actual energy consumption and optimal choice of the bivalence point value. The real building has a partial external insulation and there are the heat pumps installed in the building concerned. For the heat source requirements the electric power long-term take-off is monitored during the heating season. The energy intensity of the real object is evaluated by means of the special software designed to this aim and according to the buildings energy intensity ordinance no. 148 / 2007. The main goal of this dissertation work is to evaluate the application of the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> pumps in the building objects under the giving conditions The results of this work are very useful to obtain the better orientation in the heating pumps design process and also should help the designer to choose the installed capacity properly with respect of the c 1 imatic conditions prevailing in the area of Ostrava-Karvina. The investors have no confidence in the heat pumps installation {{in the case of the}} buildings that are equipped with partial external insulation ar old building with no insulation.

40|$|For certain {{problems}} quantum {{resources can}} exponentially increase computing power, but these quantum resources are very fragile in practice. When a quantum system interacts with an external environment, it undergoes decoherence - {{the loss of}} quantum correlation - and relaxation - the loss of energy - and eventually all of the quantum information is lost. Here we show a general principle of using unitary operators to suppress relaxation processes. Unitary operations do not cool a quantum system and seem an unlikely candidate for preventing irreversible <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> processes, but surprisingly most decoherence processes can be corrected or ameliorated using open loop control with unitary controllers. We examine the different mechanisms of decoherence and relaxation on simple spin systems and discuss when the modes can be corrected. We show experimentally the feasibility of our correction schemes using nuclear magnetic resonance. We also demonstrate control of the nuclear spins over long time scales. Finally, we discuss the applications of unitary correction to higher dimensional systems and the potential applications to quantum information processing. by Benjamin Harris Recht. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Energy {{deposition}} {{in the form}} of a direct current spark discharge in Mach 2. 2 flow is experimentally investigated, to measure the conversion efficiency of electrical energy into thermal energy. The energy is impulsively deposited into to the flow. This impulsive deposition occurs much faster than the flow can react, creating a strong blast wave and a high temperature, high pressure region in the flow. The plasma discharge is created between two sharpened tungsten electrodes inclined into the flow, powered by a pulsing high voltage RC circuit. Schlieren imagery was utilized to track the expansion of the blast wave and the expansion of the high temperature, high pressure region created by the spark discharge into a low density region. To estimate the conversion efficiency of electrical energy into the thermal energy in the flow, a high temperature <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> and expansion model was developed to simulate the deposition process. The model consisted of two portions. First, the thermodynamic properties of N 2, O 2, N, O, Ar, were calculated from the NASA PAC database, valid for temperatures 200 - 20, 000 K. A high temperature air mixture was then constructed from the five species assuming chemical equilibrium for temperature from 200 - 20, 000 K. Second, a heating and expansion model was developed utilizing the high temperature air properties. The energy deposition was modeled as a constant volume heating process to simulate its impulsive nature. The initial volume of the plasma is calculated from direct imaging of the discharge at delays ranging from 80 - 120 ns. The resulting high temperature, high pressure region is then mixed with varying amounts of ambient air to simulate heat transfer. The high temperature region is then expanded isentropically back to ambient pressure, where the final volume was compared to the experimental Schlieren images to estimate the conversion efficiency. Three different capacitors were used during experimentation to vary the input electrical energy three orders of magnitude; specifically, the energies were calculated to be: 3. 4, 20. 8 and 203 mJ per pulse. The range of possible efficiencies for the three cases was found to be: 70 - 90 %, 14 - 30 %, and 5 - 12 %. The lower energy case was found to be the most efficient with regards to energy conversion. However, the largest energy case was found to be more effective because it resulted in the region with the highest expanded temperature (4150 K) and lowest expanded density (0. 017 [kg m^- 3]) in its final expanded state...|$|E
