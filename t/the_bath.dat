25|$|Kent Street <b>Baths</b> were <b>the</b> first <b>baths</b> {{opened by}} <b>the</b> committee.

This structure was very limited; in practice awards of the Order of <b>the</b> <b>Bath</b> were confined to officers of field rank. Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate notice of the commanders in the field, generally members of the commander's own staff.|$|E
