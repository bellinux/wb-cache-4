Redgrave's Short <b>Title</b> <b>Catalogue</b> (2nd edn, 1976-91), and from 1641 to 1700 by Donald Goddard Wing's similarly titled bibliography (1945-51, with later supplements and addenda).

50|$|The STCV {{was started}} in 2000 {{following}} {{the model of the}} Dutch project Short <b>Title</b> <b>Catalogue</b> Netherlands (STCN) in the existing tradition of short <b>title</b> <b>catalogues.</b> In a first phase (2000-2003) only works printed in Dutch were recorded. During the second phase (2004-2007), the database was expanded to also include non-Dutch books. This phase was subsidised by the Flemish Community. Since September 2009, the STCV-project is part of Flanders Heritage Library, a consortium of six Flemish libraries with important heritage collections.|$|R

5000|$|Iberian Books is a bibliographical {{resource}} {{similar to}} the English Short <b>Title</b> <b>Catalogue,</b> helping to identify works by a given author or publisher, or on a given subject.

40|$|Research {{into the}} history of the book before 1601 has reached an {{important}} moment. Within five years, scholars will have at their disposal short <b>title</b> <b>catalogues</b> covering almost all of the print domains of Europe. Such significant advances in research infrastructure will fundamentally transform our understanding of the first great age of print. It is, therefore, timely, that we begin to address one of the most inconvenient of truths – the issue of lost books. This article focuses on publishing in French as a case study. This is a particularly fertile avenue of investigation because of the existence of two exceptional sources – short <b>title</b> <b>catalogues</b> of French books published in the 1580 s. By mapping the entries in these sources to the most recent short <b>title</b> <b>catalogue</b> of French print published in 2007, we can begin to explore the extent and character of the survival and loss of vernacular print in this period...|$|R
