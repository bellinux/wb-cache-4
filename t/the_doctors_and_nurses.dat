25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

60|$|Thirdly, of course, {{there is}} the lack of imaginative proportion, which rises into a sort of towering blasphemy.

But Mr. Price (I think that's his name) is still anxious that they should not be hurt by cigarettes. That is the sort of maniacal isolation that {{can be found in the}} deserts of Bromley. That cigarettes are bad for the health is a very tenable opinion to which the minister is quite entitled. If he happens to think that the youth of Bromley smoke too many cigarettes, and that he has any influence in urging on them the unhealthiness of the habit, I should not blame him if he gave sermons or lectures about it (with magic-lantern slides), so long as it was in Bromley and about Bromley. Cigarettes may be bad for the health: bombs and bayonets and even barbed wire are not good for the health. I never met a doctor who recommended any of them. But the trouble with this sort of man is that he cannot adjust himself to the scale of things. He would do very good service if he would go among the rich aristocratic ladies and tell them not to take drugs in a chronic sense, as people take opium in China. But he would be doing very bad service if he were to go among <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> on the field and tell them not to give drugs, as they give morphia in a hospital. But it is the whole hypothesis of war, it is its very nature and first principle, that the man in the trench is almost as much a suffering and abnormal person as the man in the hospital. Hit or unhit, conqueror or conquered, he is, by nature of the case, having less pleasure than is proper and natural to a man.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND : In {{the absence}} of an {{effective}} cervical cancer screening programme, efforts are being made to explore the feasibility of using the existing infrastructure to develop effective low-cost screening methods. AIMS : To evaluate and compare test performance of visual inspection of the cervix by a <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> a paramedical worker. SETTING AND DESIGN : Gynaecology outpatient department (OPD), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi; cross-sectional study. MATERIAL AND METHODS : One hundred women with complaints of vaginal discharge, irregular bleeding, post coital bleeding or unhealthy cervix underwent visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and Lugol&#x 2032;s iodine (VILI) by a <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurse,</b> followed by colposcopy and biopsy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED : Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for each test and compared. Concordance was determined by kappa statistics. RESULTS : VIA by nurse had a higher sensitivity (100 &#x 0025; versus 87. 5 &#x 0025;), but lower specificity (53 &#x 0025; versus 63 &#x 0025;) when compared with <b>the</b> <b>doctor,</b> but it was not statistically significant. There was moderate agreement between their VIA findings (kappa= 0. 56). VILI findings were comparable to that of the VIA, both by <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurse.</b> There was almost perfect agreement (kappa= 0. 89) between VILI by <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>nurse.</b> CONCLUSION : Visual inspection can be performed reliably by trained paramedical workers <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> is an effective screening option in low resource settings...|$|R

Methods: A descriptive study for which {{a sample of the}} act of the pertaining to the estate exams, archived in the Faculty of Medical Sciences of Cienfuegos, was revised, corresponding to the years 88 - 92, 99 - 00, 04 - 05, and tribunal members of the exams were enquired to know about the work situation of the authors, tutors, grades, investigation themes. Results: It was found that the authors work situation varies according to the municipalitie´s expansion. The present stage is characterized by the location in Venezuela and Haiti. Specialists of the Health Primary Attention have tutored most of the investigations. The excellent grade was given to more than 50 % of the investigations in the first and last stage. Conclusions: The majority of the investigations topics correspond to the main Health programs, but new ones are being adopted while others are abandoned. Methodological deficiencies continue. </strong...|$|R
