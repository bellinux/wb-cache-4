5|$|HSA {{formed an}} {{agreement}} with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> on a joint study that looked into the issue of equipping the P.1150 with two additional lift engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw from participation in the programme. This was a blow that was directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had been also seeking <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> with its West German counterparts on the matter of VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirmed fears that the P.1150 would be too small to meet customer specifications, and thus Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raised the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8kN (30,000lbf). It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach1.7–2.|$|E

5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E
