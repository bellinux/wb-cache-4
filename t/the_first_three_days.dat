5|$|Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance}} units plotted Soviet troop concentration, supply dumps and airfields, {{and marked}} them down for destruction. Additional Luftwaffe attacks {{were carried out}} against Soviet command and control centers in order to disrupt the mobilization and organization of Soviet forces. In contrast, Soviet artillery observers based at the border area had been under the strictest instructions not to open fire on German aircraft prior to the invasion. One plausible reason given for the Soviet hesitation to return fire was Stalin's initial belief that the assault was launched without Hitler's authorization. Significant amounts of Soviet territory were lost along with Red Army forces as a result; it took several days before Stalin comprehended {{the magnitude of the}} calamity. The Luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 1,489 aircraft {{on the first day of}} the invasion and over 3,100 during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> Hermann Göring, Minister of Aviation and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, distrusted the reports and ordered the figure checked. Luftwaffe staffs surveyed the wreckage on Soviet airfields, and their original figure proved conservative, as over 2,000 Soviet aircraft were estimated to have been destroyed on the first day of the invasion. In reality, Soviet losses were likely higher; a Soviet archival document recorded the loss of 3,922 Soviet aircraft in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> against an estimated loss of 78 German aircraft. The Luftwaffe reported the loss of only 35 aircraft on the first day of combat. A document from the German Federal Archives puts the Luftwaffe's loss at 63 aircraft for the first day.|$|E

To {{determine}} among infants born {{before the}} 28 th {{week of gestation}} to what extent blood gas abnormalities during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> postnatal <b>days</b> provide information {{about the risk of}} bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Methods. We studied the association of extreme quartiles of blood gas measurements (hypoxemia, hyperoxemia, hypocapnea, and hypercapnea) in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> postnatal <b>days,</b> with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, among 906 newborns, using multivariable models adjusting for potential confounders.

In models that did not adjust for ventilation, hypoxemia was associated with increased risk of severe BPD and very severe BPD, while infants who had hypercapnea were at increased risk of very severe BPD only. In contrast, infants who had hypocapnea were at reduced risk of severe BPD. Including ventilation for 14 or more days eliminated the associations with hypoxemia and with hypercapnea and made the decreased risk of very severe BPD statistically significant. Conclusions.

5|$|Fighting {{in support}} of the Nam River front in the {{northern}} part of the 25th Division sector were five batteries of the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions, firing 105mm howitzers, and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion which fired 155mm howitzers, for a total of 36 guns. One 155mm howitzer fired from Komam-ni to the area north of Chungam-ni, the route for the NK 6th Division's supplies. Another forward artillery piece kept the Iryong-ni bridge over the Nam under fire. The 25th Division artillery estimated it killed approximately 1,825 North Korean soldiers during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> of September. In this critical time, the US Fifth Air Force added its firepower to that of the division artillery {{in support of}} the ground force.

5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days.

For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed {{a higher proportion of}} flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E

5|$|Tickets to {{the game}} sold quickly at first, but trailed off as the game approached. Virginia Tech sold 5,000 tickets in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after the Hokies were selected, but one week later, Tech managed to {{increase}} that total to just 8,300. In an effort to spur sales at the school, Virginia Tech athletic director Jim Weaver asked fans to buy tickets {{even if they did}} not plan on attending the game. The tickets could then be donated to charity. As an incentive for Gator Bowl officials to select Virginia Tech, the school agreed to sell 18,000 tickets—more than the minimum 11,500 North Carolina agreed to sell. When a shortfall resulted in Tech selling just 11,000 tickets, the school was forced to purchase the remaining 7,000, costing Virginia Tech $245,000. At North Carolina, tickets sales were even slower, with about 6,000 having been sold through the school two weeks after the matchup was announced. The Gator Bowl ticket office sold approximately 22,000 tickets directly to fans in the same timeframe, and Gator Bowl officials predicted a crowd of between 50,000 and 55,000 people at the game.|$|E

Charlie and Saffia later became housemates after walking barefoot over broken sugar glass, believing it to be real glass, and Karly became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing that she had a motorbike ridden over her stomach. Freddie and Sophie became housemates after changing their names, documented by deed poll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively. On Day 3 Cairon earned housemate status by dunking a biscuit in a cup of tea for 25.5 seconds without it disintegrating. Remaining non-housemates Angel, Beinazir, Marcus, Siavash, Sophia and Sree faced the public vote on Day 4 to determine which five would become housemates and which one would be evicted. With 6.8% of a vote to save, Beinazir became the first evictee without ever becoming a housemate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war the ground attack groups were still able to impose {{operational}} constraints upon the enemy. Most notably the aircraft participated in the defence of Berlin. On 12 January 1945 the 1st Belorussian Front initiated the Vistula–Oder Offensive. The offensive made rapid progress. However, the Soviets eventually outran their air support which was unable to use forward, quagmire-filled, airfields. The Germans, who had fallen back on air bases resplendent with good facilities and concrete runways, were able to mount uninterrupted attacks against Soviet army columns. Reminiscent of the early years, the Luftwaffe was able to inflict high losses largely unopposed. Over 800 vehicles were destroyed within two weeks. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> of February 1945, 2,000 vehicles and 51 tanks were lost to German air attacks. The Belorussian Front was forced to abandon its attempt to capture Berlin by mid-February 1945. The Ju 87 participated in these intense battles in small numbers. It was the largest concentration of German air power since 1940 and even late as February 1945 the Germans were able to achieve and challenge for air superiority on the Eastern Front. The air offensive was instrumental in saving Berlin, albeit only for three months. The effort exhausted German fuel reserves. The contribution of the Ju 87 was exemplified by Hans-Ulrich Rudel, who claimed 13 enemy tanks on 8 February 1945.|$|E
