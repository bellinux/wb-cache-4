5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification. At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the Westridge area on the 1928 electoral roll numbered over 130. At the , Yarralumla had a {{population of}} 2,890 people. Of these 46.9% were male. The suburb had only 1.0% indigenous Australians, substantially {{below the national average}} of 2.8%. The percentage of married people in the suburb was nine points higher than the national average, and the proportion of residents who had never married was 9 points lower. Despite the higher level of marriage, this did not <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> higher level of children; 49.6% of families consisted of a couple without children in the household, compared to the national average of 37.8%. Yarralumla residents had a median age of 49, compared to a Canberra average of 35. The suburb had an older population for a city of young people; the median national age is 38 and 41.7% of Yarralumla residents were 55 or over, compared to the national figure of 27.6%.|$|E
5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{relatively}} small mandate in terms of votes, some socialists {{took to the streets}} to free political prisoners, without waiting for the government to do so officially. There were claims of an imminent socialist or anarchist takeover. The right had firmly believed, at all levels, that they would win. Portela would, a year later, claim that Gil-Robles and General Francisco Franco had approached him within days to the election to propose a military takeover. Portela resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the Popular Front, which had proved an effective election tool, did not <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Popular Front government. Largo Caballero and other elements of the political left were not prepared to work with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. Manuel Azaña Díaz was called upon to form a government, but would shortly replace Zamora as president. The right began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E

The Newspoll in The Australian on 28 September showed Labor ahead with 52%, which would give Labor a comfortable majority.|$|E

This technique is used by hackers to crack commercial software, and competitors to produce software with similar results from competing companies.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} {{began with}} Labor leading in all published national opinion polls. On 31 August, Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper gave Labor a lead of 52% to 48% nationwide, which would <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> comfortable win for Labor {{in terms of}} seats. Most commentators, however, expected the election to be very close, pointing out that Labor was also ahead in the polls at the comparable point of the 1998 election, which Howard won.|$|E
25|$|Vaughan {{plans to}} use the subway {{extension}} to spur the development of a transit-oriented city centre at Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station. Vaughan Councillor Alan Shefman stated the new city centre will eventually create the density to justify a subway. However, the Sheppard subway shows that while a subway may spur development, that development may not <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> high subway ridership. As Royson James pointed out in the Toronto Star, commuter destinations may be scattered throughout the Greater Toronto Area where public transit is inconvenient to use.|$|E
25|$|The grape {{clusters}} of Mourvèdre are relatively compact, enhancing its susceptibility to mildew, with small thick-skinned berries that {{are high in}} both color and flavor phenolics, particularly tannins. Even though the variety ripens late, {{it has the potential}} to ripen to high Brix sugar levels which can <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> high alcohol level during fermentation. The vine can also be very vigorous, producing abundant foliage that can shade the grape clusters, affecting canopy management decisions for growers. In Australia and California, many of the oldest plantings of Mourvèdre are bush trained as the vines grows well vertically but the variety can be grown under many different kinds of vine training systems.|$|E

As a result, if recovery is excluded from consideration, a number of contraction operators are <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single revision operator, which can be then <b>translated</b> back <b>into</b> exactly one contraction operator. This operator {{is the only one}} of the initial group of contraction operators that satisfies recovery; among this group, it is the operator that preserves as much information as possible.|$|R

25|$|The Treaty of Versailles banned most {{aspects of}} aerial {{development}} in Germany. For {{all of its}} diligence the treaty did not prohibit naval exercises with aircraft. The loophole allowed {{for the development of}} aircraft in the naval sphere of influence. The Paris Treaty of 1926 restated the terms of the treaty in Versailles but relented over the issue of air defence. Germany would be permitted to develop air defence systems to guard against aerial aggression. Although this did not <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> green light to develop naval aircraft by 1927 the Germans were initiating secret training and design programs at Warnemuende under the guise of Radio Experimental Command. A Coastal Air Section was created but masqueraded as a private enterprise. It was dissolved on 1 September 1929 in favour of using private firms. The Reichsmarine hired aircraft for fleet exercises from Luftdienst G.m.b.H which charged the navy 453 RM per hour for a contracted allowance of 3,000 flying hours per year. By 31 January 1931 naval cadets were joining the navy and the first regulations on cooperation between naval and air units had been published. The beginnings of a naval air arm had been created.|$|E
25|$|Layton also {{continued}} {{his effort to}} improve his party's standing in Quebec. The NDP ran French-language ads in the province and Layton, who spoke colloquial Québécois French, appeared in them. He advocated replacing the first-past-the-post system with proportional representation. He threatened to use the NDP's clout {{in the event of}} a minority government. However, it was dismissed out of hand by the Liberal and Bloc Québécois leaders, as they tend to be favored by the first-past-the-post system, normally being allocated a greater proportion of seats than the proportion of votes cast for them. Historically, the NDP's popular vote does not <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> proportional number of seats because of scattered support. This was most opposed by the Bloc Québécois, who usually had the lowest popular vote but nonetheless won many seats because their support was concentrated in Quebec. Despite these problems, Layton led the NDP to a 15% popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won under Alexa McDonough in 1997, and far short of the 40 that Layton predicted on the eve of the election. However, some potential NDP voters may have voted Liberal to prevent a possible Conservative win. Olivia Chow and several other prominent Toronto NDP candidates lost tight races and Layton won his own seat against incumbent Liberal Dennis Mills by a much narrower margin than early polls indicated.|$|E

[...] Producer Robert Tapert agreed with Raimi, commenting that he [...] "enjoyed when an actor bleeds." [...] While shooting a scene with Campbell running down a hill, Campbell tripped and injured his leg. Raimi enjoyed poking Campbell's injury with a stick he found in the woods. Because of the copious amounts {{of blood in the}} film, the crew produced gallons of fake blood with karo syrup. It took Campbell hours to remove the sticky substance from himself. Several actors had inadvertently been stabbed or thrown into objects during production.|$|E
