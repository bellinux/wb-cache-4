5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building.</b> The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Værnes {{was taken}} into use by the Royal Norwegian Army in 1887. The first flight was made in 1914, and aerodrome {{facilities}} were gradually installed. The first main installations, including three concrete runways, were built during World War II by Luftwaffe. After the war, the Air Force Pilot School moved to Værnes, although in 1954 {{most of the other}} air force activities for Central Norway were moved to Ørland Main Air Station. Civilian aviation started in 1951, when half a barracks {{was taken into}} use as a terminal, with <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> being utilized from 1958. Jet aircraft started serving Værnes from 1963, and the second terminal opened in 1965. The third (the current international Terminal B) was opened in 1982, and the fourth, Terminal A, was opened in 1994, along with the train station. From 1956 to 2004, Braathens was one of the largest airlines at the airport.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1994 and in November 1995, City of Canterbury councillors met {{to decide}} whether to {{demolish}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> at a cost of £275,000, retain just the original 1924 seaward side or refurbish <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> at £300,000 plus future maintenance costs. The walls, roof, floors, steelwork, railings and turrets were in need of repair; then new glazed windows, redecoration and a new sea wall would be required.|$|E

50|$|The street {{used to be}} an {{important}} business hub in the 1920s engaged in wholesale fruits business. In 1921, the west side of Zhongzheng Road underwent major construction and the east side followed soon afterwards. In 1937, some Japanese government officials ordered <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>buildings</b> along <b>the</b> road to be renovated into Baroque style according to urban plan.|$|R
25|$|Moulsecoomb Place was {{designated}} a Grade II Listed building on 20 August 1971. The timber-framed hall {{house to the}} rear had been listed on its own on 13 October 1952; in 1971 the listing was expanded to cover <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
25|$|The frontage, {{built of}} steel, cast iron, glass and teak {{and leaving the}} centre roofless, was built in 1932 {{at a cost of}} £3,100 to {{accommodate}} up to 1,000 people and was opened by the Royal Artillery Band. Contemporary drawings indicate that plans were under consideration to roof over <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building,</b> but that never happened.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> {{required}} in its construction twenty-six thousand {{square feet of}} glass weighing twenty-five tons, and two tones of putty. It is a marvel of architectural beauty, surpassing in this respect any similar construction in the United States, and is only equaled in size by the Government Conservatory of in the Horticultural Gardens at Washington.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{is composed of}} two wings, nearly symmetrical, connected by an impressive entrance and a cylindrical atrium. On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> has many neoclassical characteristics: symmetry, geometrical order, use of ancient Greek and Roman orders, elegant shapes.|$|R
60|$|In <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> vast <b>building</b> all was uproar. Telephones, {{megaphones}} and gramophones were ringing {{throughout the}} building. Elevators flew up and down, stopping nowhere.|$|R
50|$|The {{two parts}} of the Wickhams {{building}} form part of a greater design, anticipating the eventual purchase of the jewellers and its incorporation into <b>the</b> <b>whole.</b> <b>The</b> <b>building</b> was originally designed to upstage Selfridges department store in Oxford Street, having a colonnaded front but with a central tower and clock that Selfridges did not have.|$|R
25|$|Reconstruction {{started in}} 1992 and in 1997 the Central Library opened. However, {{it was not}} until 2000 that the {{building}} works were finished and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> could be opened. The Central Library occupies about half of the Armoury, while the rest is occupied by the Centre for Information Technologies, the University Press, the University Archive and the Eurocentre.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 14 June 2017, a fire at the Grenfell Tower engulfed the building, killing at least seventy-nine residents. It was speculated even whilst events were {{unfolding}} that a recent refurbishment of the block had, through the flammable cladding panels that were added to the exterior, contributed to the speed of engulfment of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
25|$|Located in the {{northwest}} of the city, the Bahours locality had two castles, {{one of which was}} destroyed in 1960. The remaining one is a strong house (manse) built in the 17th century, possibly on the foundations of a more ancient building. The main interest of this strong house is its kitchen listed as a historical monument, like <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
40|$|Crashed or {{dimensional}} rocks {{have been}} used as natural construction material, decoration stone or as material for artistic sculptures. Especially old historical towns not only in Slovakia have had experiences with use of stones for construction purposes for centuries. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>buildings</b> were made from dimensional stone, like sandstone, limestone or rhyolite. Pavements were made especially from basalt, andesite, rhyolite or granite. Also the most common modern construction material - concrete includes large amounts of crashed rock, especially limestone, dolostone and andesite...|$|R

50|$|Effective {{energy-efficient}} {{building design}} can {{include the use}} of low cost Passive Infra Reds (PIRs) to switch-off lighting when areas are unnoccupied such as toilets, corridors or even office areas out-of-hours. In addition, lux levels can be monitored using daylight sensors linked to the building's lighting scheme to switch on/off or dim the lighting to pre-defined levels {{to take into account the}} natural light and thus reduce consumption. Building Management Systems (BMS) link all of this together in one centralised computer to control <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building's</b> lighting and power requirements.|$|R
25|$|By 1936 the Hamiltons had {{abandoned}} the house, and Bo'ness Town Council were demolishing it when Stanley Cursitor, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, heard that new wall paintings had been discovered. The Ministry of Works quickly secured the wing with the paintings, and recovered the oak ribbed ceiling of the Parable Room. The paintings were restored, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> {{is now in the}} care of Historic Scotland.|$|E
25|$|During {{the socialist}} regime in Bulgaria, in Kochan, as {{everywhere}} in state, the confession of any religion was limited and {{the access to}} the mosque banned. Eventually in 1989 the minaret of the mosque was ruined {{in such a manner}} that it damaged <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building.</b> Immediately after the rise of democracy in the late 1989, an effort to repair the mosque began. It was finished to its present state in 1991.|$|E
25|$|In 1892 {{she became}} happily married to John Cochrane, but {{continued}} to trade {{under the name of}} Miss Cranston's Tearooms. She opened new tearooms in Buchanan Street in 1897 (designed by George Washington Browne), expanded to take over <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> in Argyle Street by 1898 (designed by H and D Barclay), then completed her chain of four establishments with the Willow Tearooms (by Charles Rennie Mackintosh) in Sauchiehall Street, opened in 1903.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the thermal resistance characteristics of walls with multilayer reflective insulation. The tests {{have been performed}} using a heat flow meter to determine the resistivity of the layers simulating partition walls in buildings. A modification of the structure has also been proposed and analysed {{with a view to}} increase the thermal resistance and, consequently, reduce the heat flux transferred through the walls. Consequently, walls produced with layers that ensure higher thermal insulation lead to better thermal performance properties of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>buildings,</b> which reduce heating/cooling costs throughout the year...|$|R

25|$|Inside {{the black}} box is a perfect White Cube. The {{building}} is clearly structured with maximum space devoted to art. The visible exterior of the building corresponds almost exactly to the public exhibition spaces. There are six exhibition rooms arranged around two diametrically opposed staircases. The ground plan, reminiscent of a windmill’s sails, enables diagonal views through <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building.</b> These exhibition rooms offer art the largest possible freedom through their clarity and precision.|$|E
25|$|Kate Cranston {{expanded}} {{her first}} tearoom {{to take over}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> at 114 Argyle Street and commissioned Walton to design a new more modern interior, which opened in 1898. Walton's work included fireplaces, stencilled wall murals and stained glass panels for the doors. In the luncheon room the murals and door panels had a rose pattern theme. The furniture was designed by Mackintosh, introducing {{for the first time}} his characteristic high-backed chairs.|$|E
25|$|Buildings {{included}} on the National Register of Historic Places must have all of their basic structural elements as parts of buildings, such as ells and wings; interiors or facades are not independently eligible for the National Register. As such, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>building</b> is considered during the nomination and its significant features must be identified. If a nominated building has lost any of its basic structural elements, it is considered a ruin and categorized as a site.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that fires can cause {{significant}} damage to reinforced concrete building structures. In many cases, fire would only affect some parts of the building. It is therefore more economical and environmentally friendly to repair the fire-exposed structural components rather than to demolish <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>buildings.</b> In this paper, a summary of experimental study of fire-exposed rectangular reinforced concrete (RC) columns repaired with post-compressed plates (PCP) is described. In the meantime, the design method for this new type of PCP repairing fire-exposed RC columns that can ensure proper repairing details for desirable performance is presented...|$|R
