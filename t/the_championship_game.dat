5|$|The Giants made <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> {{again the}} next year, but lost in a rematch to the Packers, 31–16.

In 1944, the Giants reached <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> where they faced the Green Bay Packers {{for the third time}} in ten seasons. They lost again, this time 14–7 as Ted Fritsch scored two touchdowns, and the Packers defense held on to the lead despite a fourth-quarter touchdown by the Giants.

5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some {{because of the}} number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) the team with the second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with the best record in the other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

5|$|Under Collier, Jones {{supervised}} the offensive backfield and the ends, {{but was also}} the Browns' offensive play-caller.

Cleveland went on to win <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> against the Baltimore Colts in 1964.
