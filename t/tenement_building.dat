5|$|At 9a.m. on July4, Berger {{left her}} {{apartment}} for the Mother Earth offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb had exploded prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger's <b>tenement</b> <b>building,</b> wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently {{was not involved}} in the conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men's funerals.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Hill {{directed}} a film originally called Looters about two firemen who cross paths with criminals while searching for stolen loot {{in an abandoned}} East St. Louis <b>tenement</b> <b>building.</b> However, the L.A. Riots broke out shortly before the film's release and the studio delayed its opening, eventually changing the title to Trespass.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{conclusion}} presents {{two different}} endings. One version shows Lilja being sent {{back in time}} after killing herself to when she {{made the decision to}} go to Sweden with Andrei. However, this time she rejects Andrei's offer to go to Sweden, and she and Volodya are shown to presumably live happier lives. In the other ending, Lilya and Volodya are both angels happily playing basketball on the roof of a <b>tenement</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the fall, Polly's husband Dick {{moved back}} home. His parents {{supplied}} a small living allowance and Dick, Polly, {{and the two}} children moved into a three-story <b>tenement</b> <b>building.</b> Crosby lived with his father while Dick continued his studies at Harvard. While Dick worked at the bank, Harry Crosby sent crates of flowers from his mother's garden to Polly's apartment and brought over toys for the children. They drove to the shore together. Dick volunteered to join the fire department and persuaded the fire chief to wire a fire alarm bell to his home, so he could turn out at any hour. The fire chief soon let Dick go, and Dick retreated into drink again.|$|E
25|$|Livingstone {{was born}} on 19 March 1813 in the mill town of Blantyre, Scotland in a <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> for the workers of a cotton factory {{on the banks of}} the River Clyde under the bridge {{crossing}} into Bothwell. He was the second of seven children born to Neil Livingstone (1788–1856) and his wife Agnes (née Hunter; 1782–1865). David was employed at the age of ten in the cotton mill of Henry Monteith & Co. in Blantyre Works. He and his brother John worked twelve-hour days as piecers, tying broken cotton threads on the spinning machines. He was a student at the Charing Cross Hospital Medical School in 1838–40, with his courses covering medical practice, midwifery, and botany.|$|E
25|$|More recently, the {{gentrification}} {{that was}} previously confined to north of Delancey Street continued south. Several restaurants, bars, and galleries opened below Delancey Street after 2005, especially around {{the intersection of}} Broome and Orchard Streets. The neighborhood's second boutique hotel, Blue Moon Hotel, opened on Orchard Street just south of Delancey Street in early 2006. However, unlike The Hotel on Rivington, the Blue Moon used an existing <b>tenement</b> <b>building,</b> and its exterior is almost identical to neighboring buildings. In September 2013, {{it was announced that}} the Essex Crossing redevelopment project was to be built in the area, centered around the intersection of Essex and Delancey Streets, but mostly utilizing land south of Delancey Street.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} railway works, the 'Dalry Road Depot' also existed {{to the east}} of Dalry, {{including}} a goods yard and several engine sheds. These were demolished in the 1960s (with the main engine shed being demolished in October 1965). The site is part of the West Approach Road and a park. The railway works served the former Wester Dalry Branchline, which {{was a part of the}} Caledonian Railway to Leith via the now defunct Edinburgh Princes Street railway station. The railway had two stops in Dalry; 'Dalry Road' and 'Dalry Junction'. The Dalry Road Stop was a passenger station, built to meet demand following the <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> boom in Dalry, and it opened in 1894. The station closed on 30 April 1962. The line is now closed and removed; a small section of the platform is visible on a park path near Orwell Terrace. The section of the line between Haymarket West Junction and the Dalry Junction station is now a roadway, the West Approach Road which takes traffic directly into the city centre.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' bedroom is. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E

500|$|In Russia, the young, deeply {{religious}} Hasidic Jew Frimme Hersh carves {{a contract with}} God on a stone tablet {{to live a life}} of good deeds; he attributes to it his later success in life. [...] He moves to New York, into a <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> at 55 Dropsie Avenue, and lives a simple life devoted to God. [...] He adopts an infant girl, Rachele, who is abandoned on his doorstep. [...] When she dies of a sudden illness, Hersh is infuriated, and accuses God of violating their contract. [...] He abandons his faith, shaves his beard, and lives a life as a miserly businessman in a penthouse with a gentile mistress. [...] He illicitly uses a synagogue's bonds that were entrusted to him to buy the <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> in which he had lived when poor. [...] He becomes dissatisfied with his new way of life, and decides that he needs a new contract with God to fill the emptiness he feels. [...] He has a group of rabbis draw up a new contract, but when he returns home with it, his heart fails and he dies. [...] A boy, Shloime, finds Hersh's old contract, and signs his own name to it. [...] Eisner appended a page to the 2006 edition, depicting Shloime ascending the stairs to the tenement.|$|E
500|$|The police {{investigate}} {{a string of}} murders committed by the Creeper (Rondo Hatton), a mysterious killer with a hideously disfigured face. The Creeper attacks and murders Professor Cushman (John Hamilton), a professor from the nearby Hampton University. Later that night, the killer approaches a woman named Joan Bemis (Janelle Johnson) {{in front of her}} home and identifies himself as Hal Moffet. Joan screams hysterically at the sight of him until he is driven to kill her. When police cars approach, the Creeper climbs the fire escape of a city <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> to escape and enters the apartment of Helen Paige (Jane Adams), a blind pianist. Unable to see the Creeper's deformed face, Helen is not afraid of the intruder, even when he admits to fleeing. [...] When police officers knock on her door, failing to identify themselves, Helen encourages him to hide in her bedroom, where he escapes through the window.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1961, a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 {{minicomputer}} was installed in the [...] "kludge room" [...] of the MIT Electrical Engineering Department to complement the older TX-0, and even before its arrival {{a group of students}} and university employees had been brainstorming ideas for programs that would demonstrate the new computer's capabilities in a compelling way. Three of them—Steve Russell, then an employee at Harvard University and a former research assistant at MIT; Martin Graetz, a research assistant and former student at MIT; and Wayne Wiitanen, a research assistant at Harvard and former employee and student at MIT—referring to their collaboration as the [...] "Hingham Institute" [...] as Graetz and Wiitanen were living in a <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> on Hingham Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{came up with the idea}} for Spacewar. [...] "We had this brand new PDP-1", Steve Russell told Rolling Stone in a 1972 interview. [...] "Marvin Minsky had built some little pattern-generating programs which made interesting patterns like a kaleidoscope. Not a very good demonstration. Here was this display that could do all sorts of good things! So we started talking about it, figuring what would be interesting displays. We decided that probably you could make a two-dimensional maneuvering sort of thing, and decided that naturally the obvious thing to do was spaceships." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{defining}} moment in Superboy's life would come when Superman asks Superboy {{to come with}} him to the Fortress of Solitude. While there, Superboy visits Krypton via virtual reality. After explaining how he considers Superboy part of his family, Superman offers him the Kryptonian name Kon-El. Superboy tearfully accepts, overjoyed with the simple joy of having a real name. He would eventually accept the name [...] "Conner." [...] After Cadmus was shut down, Superboy had no job and no place to stay. He relocates to Metropolis, becoming the [...] "super" [...] at a <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> called Calvin Gardens.

2500|$|On Friday, 15 August 1969, {{mother of}} three, Jemima McDonald, 32, also {{went for a}} night out at the Barrowland Ballroom. The next day Jemima's sister Margaret heard rumours {{in the area that}} young {{children}} were seen leaving an old <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> in MacKeith Street talking about [...] "the body." [...] By the Monday morning, Margaret was so concerned that she herself, fearing the worst, went to the old building where she found Jemima's battered body. She had been strangled, raped and beaten to death. Unlike Patricia Docker, Jemima was fully clothed when her body was found. Witnesses said that they had seen her leaving the club at midnight with a tall, slim young man with red hair. Police conducted door-to-door enquiries at the time and found a woman who remembered hearing screams coming from the same building in MacKeith Street, although she could not vouch for the time. Police considered the information of little use and the investigation was later wound down.|$|E
2500|$|He {{initially}} {{joined the}} Ninth Militia Regiment, but reportedly anxious for active duty, {{he left the}} unit for the Second and then Seventy-First Regiments until finally leaving for the front lines with the Seventh Regiment. He had to borrow {{the money to pay}} for his uniform. After his enlistment period was up, he returned to his home state to raise the First Vermont Cavalry serving with them until 1863. He had reached the rank of Captain by that time and, that summer, he was appointed a provost marshal and assigned to New York City where he would oversee enforcing conscription in the Tenth District. Although criticized for the low number of recruits compared to the other provost marshals in the city, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton defended Erhardt's efforts stating [...] "The men he enlists may be few but they go to the front and fight, every one of them. They are not bounty jumpers". In the days before the New York Draft Riots, he was confronted by several men with iron bars while trying to collect names in a new <b>tenement</b> <b>building</b> at Broadway and Liberty Street. Erhardt held the men off for three hours while waiting for reinforcements, armed only with his pistol, but was eventually forced to retreat without the names.|$|E
