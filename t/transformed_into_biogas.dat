50|$|Biogas is {{produced}} as landfill gas (LFG), which {{is produced}} by the breakdown of Biodegradable waste inside a landfill due to chemical reactions and microbes, or as digested gas, produced inside an anaerobic digester. A biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes or energy crops. It can be produced using anaerobic digesters (air-tight tanks with different configurations). These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process, the microorganisms transform biomass waste into biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and digestate. The biogas is a renewable energy {{that can be used}} for heating, electricity, and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine, such as GE Jenbacher or Caterpillar gas engines. Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>biogas.</b> It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser.|$|E
40|$|Summary Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) is {{a biological}} process whereby, {{in the absence}} of oxygen, organic matter is <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>biogas</b> and digestate. In recent years AD has received new attention in the Dutch agricultural sector by introducing the co-digestion technology. Co-digestion is a method to improve biogas yield by adding co-substrates (e. g. maize or grass) to livestock waste products (manure). From an economical perspective, enriching a digester with energy crops might be feasible. However, using non-waste products, explicitly grown for biogas production, also increases the potential for anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. In this research the GHG balance of “green electricity” from co-digesters has been evaluated using CH 4, N 2 O and CO 2 as essential parameters. Back in the early 70 s the process of AD was developed for waste disposal. Due to the combination of organic material reduction and methane production it was reviewed as a very attractive process. In the agricultural sector AD was used to reduce manure storage emissions by producing electricity. It has been calculated that a farm based on 100 cows can reduce approximately 118, 000 – 138, 500 kg CO 2 eq per year depending on the manure management system applied. To place this value in perspective; this is approximately equivalent to the emissions of an average passenger car traveling 1 million km. Adding energy crops to AD increases the biogas yield. However, it requires also cultivating practices to grow the organic plants. Cultivating crops requires besides labour also heavy machinery, diesel fuel and synthetic fertilizer. The produced biogas in the digester contains CH 4 and is used for combustion. However, CH 4 in itself is also a strong GHG and gas leakages during digestion are not uncommon. The Dutch government assumes a value of 1 % for fugitive leakages, but this research found a value of 5. 3 ± 1. 8 %. Also, it was found that during electricity production, unburned hydrocarbons (potential GHG) are emitted into the atmosphere (2. 3 % vol of fuel input). Using the 1 % fugitive leakages as assumed by the government, co-digester can reduce GHG emissions of electricity generation compared to conventional fossil fuel powered electricity (0. 11 - 0. 16 kg CO 2 eqkWh- 1). However, there is no consensus in literature on a valid value for fugitive leakages. CH 4 has a global warming potential of 23 and potential losses quickly reduce the positive GHG balance of “green electricity”. It has been calculated that at 7. 4 - 8. 3 % gas leakages, depending on used co-substrate, the total GHG emissions of “green electricity” production by a co-digester are equal to the emitted GHG emissions of the fossil fuel electricity mix in the Netherlands (0. 47 kg CO 2 eqkWh- 1). Renewable electricity is needed to sustain our life standards for future generations. Digesting manure waste streams is an effective method to reduce GHG emissions and produce energy. By implementing subsidies and other incentives on biogas production, electricity generation became more interesting than the original intended function of waste disposal. A higher value for fugitive leakages has been found than assumed by the government. This also implies that “green electricity” from co-digesters, most likely, will not meet the sustainability criteria developed for biomass as energy source (< 0. 14 kg CO 2 eqkWh- 1). Comprehensive {{research is needed to determine}} a general valid value for fugitive leakages from Dutch co-digesters and thus the overall global warming potential of this energy source. ...|$|E

40|$|Biomass, {{considered}} one of the main sources of alternative energy, originates from residual organic material such as the cassava crop. Biodigesters are capable of <b>transforming</b> these residuals <b>into</b> <b>biogas</b> and biofertilizers. This allows a reduction of almost 80 % in the residual organic material being deposited in the earth or rivers, avoiding deposits accumulating on riverbeds and negative environmental impacts. It also allows substantial savings in terms of energy. The general aim {{of this study is to}} investigate, with the implementation of biodigesters, how eco-innovation practices contribute to the economic and environmental performance of cassava processing companies in Paraná State. Through qualitative research, the method employed an exploratory approach and intensive multiple-case analyses, with data collected through semi-structured interviews. The study showed that the eco-innovation practices that were adopted aided the economic and environmental performance of the companies in question. The study contributes to academia with scientific research on biodigester technology using the residual organic material of cassava for sustainable development. It also contributes to the corporate universe by demonstrating an opportunity for sustainable innovation with improved economic and environmental performance, which can be extrapolated to other industrial segments...|$|R

50|$|Methane, {{the main}} {{constituent}} {{of natural gas}} can be produced from algae in various methods, namely gasification, pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion.

The results showed that biogas and CH 4 production were 268. 80 and 135. 31 NmL. gVS(- 1) added, respectively, and the average CH 4 content in biogas was 50. 34 %.
