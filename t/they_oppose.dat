25|$|A {{majority}} of the party's national and state candidates are pro-life and oppose elective abortion on religious or moral grounds. While many advocate exceptions {{in the case of}} incest, rape or the mother's life being at risk, in 2012 the party approved a platform advocating banning abortions without exception. <b>They</b> <b>oppose</b> government funding for abortions.|$|E
25|$|Conservative Christians {{are often}} {{accused of being}} {{intolerant}} by secular humanists and liberal Christians, claiming that <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> science that seems to contradict scripture (Creationism, use of birth control, abortion, research into embryonic stem cells, etc.), liberal democracy (separation of church and state), and progressive social policies (rights of people of other races and religions, of women, and of people with different sexual orientations).|$|E

25|$|John Africa's MOVE members {{lived in}} a commune in a house owned by Glassey in the Powelton Village section of West Philadelphia. They staged bullhorn-amplified, profanity-laced demonstrations against {{institutions}} that <b>they</b> <b>opposed,</b> such as zoos (MOVE had strong views on animal rights), and speakers whose views <b>they</b> <b>opposed.</b> MOVE activities drew close scrutiny from law enforcement authorities.|$|R
25|$|According to a Care2 report, vegans in the IDF may refuse {{vaccination}} if <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> animal testing. They {{are given}} artificial leather {{boots and a}} black fleece beret. Until 2014, vegan soldiers in the IDF received special allowances to buy their own food, when this policy was replaced with vegan food being provided in all bases, as well as vegan combat rations being offered to vegan combat soldiers.|$|E
25|$|However, {{teachers}} unions {{argue that}} <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> being tested and graded on their students' performance with universally standard exams {{that do not}} take into account the socio-economic differences between middle class urban schools and under-equipped poor rural schools, which has an important effect on the students performance. Also, teachers argue that the legislations are ambiguous, only focus on the teachers, without touching the Education Ministry, and will allow more abuses and more political corruption.|$|E
25|$|Trotskyism is {{the theory}} of Marxism as {{advocated}} by Leon Trotsky. Trotsky identified himself as an orthodox Marxist and Bolshevik-Leninist, and supported founding a vanguard party of the proletariat, proletarian internationalism, and a dictatorship of the proletariat based on working class self-emancipation and mass democracy. Trotskyists are critical of Stalinism, as <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> Stalin's theory of Socialism in One Country in favor of Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution. Trotskyists also criticize the bureaucracy that developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin.|$|E

25|$|Ahl-i Hadith is a {{movement}} which emerged in North India in the mid-19th century. By rejecting taqlid (following legal precedent) and favoring ijtihad (independent legal reasoning) based on the foundational scriptures of Islam, <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> the traditional madhhab and criticize their reliance on legal authorities other than the traditional texts. The Ahl-i Hadith was the first organization which printed and spread the works of Muhammad ash-Shawkani, whose writings did also influence {{the doctrine of the}} Salafi movement in the Arab Middle East and worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle <b>they</b> <b>oppose,</b> it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
25|$|In The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy, Christopher Lasch {{analyzes}} the widening {{gap between the}} top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to The revolt of the masses (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.|$|E

25|$|The first biographers, Nowacka and Ziątek, {{responded to}} Domosławski's {{allegations}} {{with their own}} new book, Literatura non-fiction. Czytanie Kapuścińskiego po Domosławskim (Non‑fiction literature: Reading Kapuściński after Domosławski) {{which was published in}} Polish by the University of Silesia Press in 2013. <b>They</b> <b>oppose</b> the accusation of creating a myth, and his own legend, as well as confabulations and opportunism, showing a selected and tendentious usage of the author’s life knowledge, the lack of comprehension of literary reportage, manipulation with texts and quotations, as well as numerous factual and technical mistakes made by Domosławski. In 2013 the publisher of Domosławski's book apologized to Alicja Kapuścińska and her daughter. In May 2015 amendments were ordered by a court in Warsaw which also ruled that Domosławski should apologise to Kapuściński's widow, however in August 2015 the same court has ruled that the author will not have to apologise to Kapuściński's daughter.|$|E
25|$|Democrats {{support a}} more {{progressive}} tax structure {{to provide more}} services and reduce economic inequality by {{making sure that the}} wealthiest Americans pay the highest amount in taxes. Democrats support more government spending on social services while spending less on the military. <b>They</b> <b>oppose</b> the cutting of social services, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and various other welfare programs, believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice. Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary and non-monetary terms, are a more productive labor force and cultured population, and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing positive freedom, i.e. freedom derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) budget rule {{at the start of the}} 110th Congress.|$|E
500|$|The {{largest of}} these four {{categories}} is the [...] "non-institutional" [...] Churches of Christ. [...] This group is notable for opposing congregational support of institutions such as orphans homes and Bible colleges. [...] Similarly, non-institutional congregations also oppose the use of church facilities for non-church activities (such as fellowship dinners or recreation); as such, <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> the construction of [...] "fellowship halls", gymnasiums, and similar structures. [...] In both cases, opposition {{is based on the}} belief that support of institutions and non-church activities are not proper functions of the local congregation. [...] Approximately 2,055 congregations fall in this category.|$|E
50|$|The Hart {{brothers}} published {{works of}} literary criticism, notably Kritische Waffengänge (parts 1-6, 1882-1884), in which <b>they</b> <b>opposed</b> the light reading {{chosen by the}} bourgeoisie.|$|R

50|$|<b>They</b> <b>opposed</b> {{the union}} of Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the United Province of Canada, and demanded its termination. When talks for Canadian {{confederation}} began, its members either opposed the idea, or suggested a decentralized confederation. <b>They</b> were <b>opposed</b> to the ultramontane politics of the Catholic clergy of Quebec and the Parti bleu.|$|R
500|$|The play {{starts with}} the term [...] "May I come", a warning to higher-caste people that Dalits had to cry out before {{entering}} any street, so as to not pollute the higher caste members. The Nayanar first clashes with his own Dalit brethren. <b>They</b> <b>oppose</b> his devotion for the Lord of Chidambaram, whom they call a Brahmin god. The Dalit elders— headed by Pariyakilavan— define his duties as a pariah and advise him to not confront caste rules. They tell him to worship the folk deities of the pariah, instead of Shiva, the god of Brahmanical Hinduism. The Dalits also feel that Nandanar needs {{to abide by the}} social norms and give up his taboo idea of entering a temple.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Space Seed", Khan is {{presented}} as having several positive characteristics: he is gracious, smiling, fearless and generous. He is not threatened {{by the success of}} others, and encourages their self-esteem. He is also ambitious, desiring a challenge commensurate with his abilities, but this ambition is not tempered by any consideration of the rights of others. Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk, sharing his aggressiveness, ambition, and even his womanizing tendencies, but possessing them in far greater degree. During the episode, several of the characters express their admiration for the man even as <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> him, with Kirk referring to him as [...] "the best of the tyrants, and the most dangerous." [...] The character's Spanish accent and superhuman appearance strongly differentiate him from most Star Trek characters.|$|E
2500|$|Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad {{has laid}} {{blame on the}} United States and {{coalition}} forces. [...] "They invade the shrine and bomb there because <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> God and justice," [...] Ahmadinejad said, referring to the U.S.-led multinational forces in Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, {{they argue}} that {{schizophrenia}} is an extreme mental state co-existent with the capitalist system itself and capitalism keeps enforcing neurosis {{as a way of}} maintaining normality. However, <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> a non-clinical concept of [...] "schizophrenia" [...] as deterritorialization to the clinical end-result [...] "schizophrenic" [...] (i.e. they do not intend to romanticize [...] "mental disorders"; instead, they show, like Foucault, that [...] "psychiatric disorders" [...] are always second to something else).|$|E
2500|$|Las Abejas have {{sometimes}} {{been accused of}} being a part of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), but they have always maintained their independence, saying that while they agree with much of the ideology of the EZLN (in support of indigenous rights and opposed to neoliberalism and imperialism), <b>they</b> <b>oppose</b> their violent methods. [...] Since they refuse to fully identify with the Zapatistas, however, Las Abejas {{have sometimes}} been viewed suspiciously and harassed by the EZLN.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{expression of}} Mexican pride is {{the celebration of}} the spring equinox on the Zócalo. This is done by groups looking to reassert the superiority of indigenous ethnic bloodlines (La Raza) and pre-Hispanic culture. They choose to do the ceremony here not only because it is close to where such rites used to be performed before the Spaniards came, but also because they are right next to the symbols of [...] "Spanish" [...] ecclesiastical and secular power (The Cathedral and National Palace, respectively), which <b>they</b> <b>oppose.</b>|$|E
