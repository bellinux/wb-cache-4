40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{with chronic}} severe asthma are often {{dependent}} on the long term prescription of oral corticosteroids. The use of steroids is associated with serious side effects. Physicians treating such patients continue to search for alternative therapies that {{reduce the need for}} chronic dosing with oral steroids. <b>Troleandomycin</b> is a compound that is established as an effective antibiotic but may also have non-antibacterial actions that may be useful in the treatment of asthma. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of adding <b>troleandomycin</b> to oral steroids in the treatment of chronic steroid dependent asthmatics. Search methods The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of identified articles were searched. Searches are current as of September 2010. Selection criteria Randomised trials looking at the addition of <b>troleandomycin</b> compared to placebo in adult steroid dependent asthmatics. Data collection and analysis Trial quality was assessed and data extraction was carried out by two reviewers independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Main results Three trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review and a total of 112 patients were recruited into these studies. Data from 90 patients were analysed. There was no treatment effect for <b>troleandomycin</b> in terms of steroid dose reduction (SMD - 0. 29, 95 % CI - 0. 75, 0. 17). For measures of lung function a meta-analysis of data derived from two of the included studies showed no benefits for added <b>troleandomycin</b> (SMD 0. 06 95 % CI - 0. 8, 0. 9).

Single CYPs 3 A 89, 3 A 94, and 3 A 95, recombinantly expressed in V 79 hamster lung fibroblasts, were incubated with TES and the fluorescent metabolite 7 -benzyloxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin (BFC). The effect of ketoconazole and <b>troleandomycin</b> was evaluated on single CYPs. Testosterone metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and confirmed by GC/MS.

It has been proposed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be involved as mediators of the toxic effects of CsA. Here, we have studied the possible interrelationship between CsA metabolism and production of ROS. Using cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC), CsA (1 microM) produced a rapid (within 10 min) increase in reactive oxygen species, detected by oxidation of the fluorescent probes 2, 7 -dichlorofluorescin and dihydrorhodamine- 123. DNA synthesis was increased {{in the presence of}} CsA as assessed by [3 H]thymidine incorporation. The superoxide dismutase inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (1 mM) and the iron chelator desferal (5 microM), as well as ketoconazole (1 microM) and <b>troleandomycin</b> (10 microM), inhibitors of the cytochrome P- 450 3 A, were able to block both effects.

40|$|Background—We {{observed}} that the prodrug clopidogrel was less effective in inhibiting platelet aggregation with coadministration of atorvastatin during point-of-care platelet function testing. Because atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 4, we hypothesized that clopidogrel might be activated by CYP 3 A 4. Methods and Results—Platelet aggregation was measured in 44 patients undergoing coronary artery stent implantation treated with clopidogrel or clopidogrel plus pravastatin or atorvastatin, and in 27 volunteers treated with clopidogrel and either erythromycin or <b>troleandomycin,</b> CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors, or rifampin, a CYP 3 A 4 inducer. Atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, attenuated the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel in a dose-dependent manner. Percent platelet aggregation was 3423, 5815 (P 0. 027), 7410 (P 0. 002), and 897 (P 0. 001) {{in the presence of}} clopidogrel and 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg of atorvastatin, respectively. Erythromycin attenuated platelet aggregation inhibition (5512 versus 4212 % platelet aggrega-tion; P 0. 002), as did <b>troleandomycin</b> (7818 versus 4518 % platelet aggregation; P 0. 0003), whereas rifampin enhanced platelet aggregation inhibition (3318 versus 5620 % platelet aggregation, P 0. 001). Conclusions—CYP 3 A 4 activates clopidogrel. Atorvastatin, another CYP 3 A 4 substrate, competitively inhibits this activation.

The estimated kinact and KI values for each time-dependent inhib-itor were compared with those obtained using human liver micro-somes and used to estimate the magnitude of clinical pharmaco-kinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI). The inactivation kinetic parameter, kinact, was most consistent across systems tested for clarithromycin, verapamil, and <b>troleandomycin,</b> with a high kinact of 0. 91 min 1 observed for mibefradil in HepaRG cells. The apparent KI estimates derived from the various systems displayed a range of variability from 3 -fold for clarithromycin (5. 4 – 17. 7 M) to 6 -fold for verapamil (1. 9 – 12. 6 M). In general, the inactivation kinetic param-eters derived from the cell systems tested fairly replicated what was observed in time-dependent inhibition studies using human liver microsomes.

The metabolite formation exhibited single enzyme Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent K-M {{in the range of}} 0. 09 to 1. 9 mM and V-max from 22 to 120 pmol/mg/min. A strong correlation between the formation rate of metabolites and 6 β-hydroxylation of testosterone was obtained within a panel of liver microsomes from 15 individuals (r(2) = 0. 6 to 0. 94). Moreover, ketoconazole and <b>troleandomycin,</b> specific inhibitors of CYP 3 A 4 metabolism, demonstrated a significant inhibition of laquinimod metabolism. Furthermore, in incubations with recombinant CYP 3 A 4, all the primary metabolites were formed. In vitro interaction studies with CYP 3 A 4 substrates and possible concomitant medication demonstrated that laquinimod inhibits the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol with an IC 50 value of about 150 μ M, which is high above the plasma level of laquinimod after clinically relevant doses. Ketoconazole, <b>troleandomycin,</b> erythromycin, prednisolone, and ethinyl estradiol inhibited the metabolism of laquinimod, and IC 50 values of 0. 2, 11, 24, 87, and 235 μ M, respectively, were calculated.

The likelihood for in vivo effects of laquinimod on the metabolism of other CYP 3 A 4 substrates is minor.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if cyto-chrome P 4502 D 6 and other isoforms are involved in the metabo-lism of cyclobenzaprine in human liver microsomes. Selective cytochrome P 450 inhibitors for CYPIAI/ 2 (furafylline and 7, 8 -ben-zoflavone) and CYP 3 A 4 (<b>troleandomycin,</b> gestodene, and ketocon-azole) inhibited the formation of desmethylcyclobenzaprine, a ma-jor metabolite of cyclobenzaprlne, in human liver microsomes. Antibodies directed against CYPIAI/ 2 and CYP 3 A 4 inhibited the demethylatlon reaction whereas anti-human CYP 2 C 9 / 10, CYP 2 CI 9, and CYP 2 E 1 antibodies did not show any inhibitory effects.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{thin layer}} chromatographic (TLC) method on silica gel, with dichloromethane - methanol - 25 % m/m ammonia (90 + 9 + 1. 5, nu/nu) as mobile phase, {{has been developed}} {{for the analysis of}} bulk erythromycin. Detection by post-chromatographic color reaction was achieved by spraying with 0. 15 % m/nu xanthydrol in concentrated hydrochloric acid - acetic acid (90 + 7. 5) and then heating the plate. Spots were quantitated by scanning at lambda = 525 nm, using <b>troleandomycin</b> as internal standard. The main component, erythromycin A, was separated from all related substances present in commercial samples except erythromycins B and E. Results for some commercial samples obtained by this TLC method correlated well with those obtained by a previously established LC technique. The TLC method separates erythromycin D from erythromycin A; this is not possible by LC. The application of this TLC method to biological samples of erythromycin is also reported. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} opioid alfentanil is an analgesic and an in vivo probe for hepatic and first-pass CYP 3 A activity. Alfentanil is {{a particularly}} useful CYP 3 A probe because pupil diameter change is a surrogate for plasma concentrations, thereby affording noninvasive assess-ment of CYP 3 A. Alfentanil undergoes extensive CYP 3 A 4 metabo-lism via two major pathways, forming noralfentanil and N-phenyl-propionamide. This investigation evaluated alfentanil metabolism in vitro to noralfentanil and N-phenylpropionamide, by expressed CYP 3 A 5 and CYP 3 A 7 in addition to CYP 3 A 4, with and without coexpressed or exogenous cytochrome b 5. Effects of the CYP 3 A inhibitors <b>troleandomycin</b> and ketoconazole were also determined. Rates of noralfentanil and N-phenylpropionamide formation by CYP 3 A 4 and 3 A 5 {{in the absence of}} b 5 were generally equivalent, although the metabolite formation ratio differed, whereas those by CYP 3 A 7 were substantially less.

40|$|Methoxymorpholinyl {{doxorubicin}} (MMDX; PNU 152243) is {{a promising}} doxorubicin derivative currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Previous {{in vitro studies}} suggested that the compound undergoes hepatic biotransformation by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A into a more cytotoxic metabolite(s). The present study examined the role of CYP 3 A-mediated metabolism in the in vivo antitumor activity and host toxicity of MMDX in the mouse model and investigated the potential for increasing the therapeutic effectiveness of the drug by inducing its hepatic CYP-catalyzed activation. We found that MMDX cytotoxicity for cultured M 5076 tumor cells was potentiated 22 -fold by preincubating the drug with NADPH-supplemented liver microsomes from untreated C 57 BL/ 6 female mice. A greater (50 -fold) potentiation of MMDX cytotoxicity was observed after its preincubation with liver microsomes isolated from animals pretreated with the prototypical CYP 3 A inducer pregnenolone- 16 alpha-carbonitrile. In contrast, in vivo administration of the selective CYP 3 A inhibitor <b>troleandomycin</b> (TAO) reduced both potentiation of MMDX cytotoxicity {{and the rate of}} CYP 3 A-catalyzed N-demethylation of erythromycin by isolated liver microsomes (55. 5 and 49...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of human cytochrome P 450 (P 450) isoforms to the metabolism of aprepitant in humans was investigated using re-combinant P 450 s and inhibition studies. In addition, aprepitant was evaluated as an inhibitor of human P 450 s. Metabolism of aprepi-tant by microsomes prepared from baculovirus-expressed human P 450 s was observed only when CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 19, or CYP 3 A 4 {{was present in}} the expression system. Incubation with CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 C 19 yielded only products of O-dealkylation, whereas CYP 3 A 4 catalyzed both N- and O-dealkylation reactions. The me-tabolism of aprepitant by human liver microsomes was inhibited completely by ketoconazole or <b>troleandomycin.</b> No inhibition was observed with other P 450 isoform-selective inhibitors. Aprepitant was evaluated also as a P 450 inhibitor in human liver microsomes.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Purpose. To {{determine}} the possible mechanism of poor bioavailability of bicyclol, and clarify the respective contribution of P- glycoprotein (P-gp) and Cytochrome 3 A (CYP 3 A). Methods. Rat in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion and Caco- 2 cell monolayer model with selective inhibitors of CYP 3 A and P-gp were employed. Results. In rat intestinal perfusion, bicyclol (50 µM) appearance in mesenteric blood (Pblood) was increased 3, 12 and 16 -fold after addition of inhibitors of P-gp (LSN 335984), CYP 3 A (<b>troleandomycin,</b> TAO) or P-gp and CYP 3 A (Cyclosporin A, CsA), respectively, whereas permeability of midazolam (CYP 3 A substrate only) was unchanged after addition of LSN 335984 and increased 5 fold after addition of TAO. Moreover, the cumulative amount of bicyclol in mesenteric blood was increased at concentration range 10 - 100 µM of bicyclol in perfusate. The basolateral to apical permeability value of bicyclol in Caco- 2 monolayer was significantly deceased by LSN 335984 and CsA. Conclusions. The poor bioavailability of bicyclol is mostly due to P-gp mediated efflux and metabolism by CYP 3 A in intestine, with CYP 3 A making more contribution than P-gp...|$|E
40|$|Expression {{profile of}} CYP 3 A {{individuals}} from piglets and characterization of CYP 3 A 29 were investigated. Real-Time PCR {{showed that the}} liver and small intestines present the highest expression levels of CYP 3 A 29, a human CYP 3 A 4 homolog. The CYP 3 A 29 was functional expressed in Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system together with NADPH p 450 reductase (NPR) and cytochrome b 5. For nifedipine oxidation (NOD) activity, recombinant CYP 3 A 29 system showed similar enzyme kinetic parameters (Km= 14. 1 similar to 25. 3 mu M) to human recombinant CYP 3 A 4, and a little variant to liver microsomes (Km= 29. 6 similar to 45. 2 mu M) from piglets. The NOD activity of recombinant CYP 3 A 29 was strongly inhibited by ketoconazole (KET) and <b>troleandomycin</b> (TAO), and was slightly changed by inhibitors for other p 450 enzymes from human. These results provided in detailed information of the characterizations of CYP 3 A 29.

40|$|International audienceLiver microsomes from rats pretreated {{with various}} {{inducers}} of P 450 isoforms exhibit very different abilities to catalyze the oxidation of N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) by NADPH and O 2 with formation of citrulline and nitrogen oxides. Treatment of rats with dexamethasone, a classical inducer of P 450 3 A, {{leads to a}} spectacular 7 -fold increase of the activity found for untreated rats, while induction by phenobarbital causes a much lower increase of this activity and induction by 3 -methylcholanthrene or clofibrate decreases it. Specific inhibitors of P 450 s 3 A as <b>troleandomycin</b> and dihydroergotamine strongly inhibit NOHA oxidation whereas metyrapone, an inhibitor of other P 450 subfamilies, was without effect. These data show the particular ability of P 450 s of the 3 A subfamily to catalyze the second step of the oxidation of L-arginine by NO synthases (NOS). This analogy between NOSs and P 450 s 3 A is further substantiated by a protein sequence comparison which shows that a 9 -amino acid segment present in all NOSs exhibits a strong similarity with the sequence mainly responsible for heme binding in P 450 s 3 A which is well conserved in all P 450 s. This segment contains all the structural factors which {{are thought to be}} crucial for heme binding in P 450 s.

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} {{oxidative}} metabolism of (S) -mephenytoin and proguanil in vitro {{and to determine}} the involvement of various cytochrome P 450 isoforms. METHODS: The kinetics {{of the formation of}} 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin and cycloguanil in human liver microsomes from 10 liver samples were determined, and inhibition of formation was studied using specific chemical inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies directed towards specific CYP 450 isoforms. Expressed CYP 450 enzymes were used to characterize further CYP isoform contribution in vitro. Livers were genotyped for CYP 2 C 19 using PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction endonuclease digestion. RESULTS: All livers were wildtype with respect to CYP 2 C 19, except HLS# 5 whose genotype was CYP 2 C 19 * 1 /CYP 2 C 19 * 2. The Km, Vmax and CLint values for the formation of 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin from (S) -mephenytoin and the formation of cycloguanil from proguanil ranged from 50. 8 to 51. 6 and 43 - 380 microm, 1. 0 - 13. 9 and 0. 5 - 2. 5 nmol mg- 1 h- 1, and 20. 2 - 273. 8 and 2. 7 - 38. 9 microl h- 1 mg- 1, respectively. There was a significant association between the Vmax values of cycloguanil and 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin formation (rs= 0. 95, P= 0. 0004). Cycloguanil formation was inhibited significantly by omeprazole (CYP 2 C 19 / 3 A), <b>troleandomycin</b> (CYP 3 A), diethyldithiocarbamate (CYP 2 E 1 / 3 A), furafylline (CYP 1 A 2), and (S) -mephenytoin. 4 '-Hydroxymephenytoin formation was inhibited significantly by omeprazole, diethyldithiocarbamate, proguanil, furafylline, diazepam, <b>troleandomycin,</b> and sulphaphenazole (CYP 2 C 9). Human CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 3 A 4 monoclonal antibodies did not inhibit the formation of cycloguanil or 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin, and cycloguanil was formed by expressed CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 19 supersomes. However, only expressed CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 C 19 supersomes formed 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin. CONCLUSIONS: The oxidative metabolism of (S) -mephenytoin and proguanil in vitro is catalysed by CYPs 2 C 19 and 1 A 2, with the significant association between Vmax values suggesting that the predominant enzymes involved in both reactions are similar. However the degree of selectively of both drugs for CYP isoforms needs further investigation, particularly the involvement of CYP 3 A 4 in the metabolism of proguanil. We assert that proguanil may not be a suitable alternative to (S) -mephenytoin as a probe drug for the CYP 2 C 19 genetic polymorphism...|$|E
