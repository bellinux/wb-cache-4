5|$|In October 1998, Mr. Niebla {{suffered}} an injury, which forced CMLL to vacate the CMLL World Trios Championship {{as it was}} not clear when Mr. Niebla would be able to wrestle again. They held a three-show, eight-team tournament from December 4 to December 12, 1998. Former champions Atlantis and Lizmark teamed up with Emilio Charles Jr. for the tournament, while Mr. Niebla actually returned to action in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the tournament as well, teaming up with Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Shocker. In the finals the trio of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther and Black Warrior defeated Los Guapos (Scorpio Jr., Bestia Salvaje and Zumbido) to lay claim to the championship.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In, {{located on}} Commissary Lane across from Star Tours and {{adjacent}} to ABC Commissary, opened on April 20, 1991 {{as one of}} the twenty new attractions opened at Walt Disney World to mark the complex's twentieth anniversary. The restaurant was created with a strong emphasis on theme, in emulation of the 50's Prime Time Café, which had opened two years prior. Disney hoped that the focus on theme would bring the Sci-Fi Dine-In the level of success that had been garnered by the 50's Prime Time Café. Within five weeks of opening, it was serving between 1,500 and 2,000 meals on a daily basis, just as the 50's Prime Time Café was doing. A year after opening, the Sci-Fi Dine-In had become the most popular restaurant in the park, serving more than 2,200 people per day at peak periods. Starting from its earliest days, the restaurant equipped its servers with point of sale mobile devices that relayed orders to a printer in the kitchen, which was considered at the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> keeping with the science fiction theme because the technology had been developed shortly prior.|$|E

[...] "To me this is a really {{interesting}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> this position and I think it would be in a way irresponsible not to put my best foot forward and lead us into a different time." [...] In September, The September Issue, a documentary film by The War Room producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 2009 season, Boren {{suffered}} a knee injury. [...] The injury was not severe {{because of the}} knee brace that he was wearing. He recovered in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the starting lineup at left guard along with his younger brother who started at fullback for the September 5 season opener against Navy. The media portrayed Boren as a nasty and intense player, which Boren downplayed. Early in the season, the offensive line struggled. But as the season progressed guards Boren and Bryant Browning teamed up with second-year linemen Michael Brewster, J.B. Shugarts and Mike Adams to form a unit that worked effectively. Boren missed the October 31 non-conference game against New Mexico State due to an unspecified foot injury. [...] When he returned to Michigan Stadium for the season finale, Michigan defensive end Brandon Graham was very vocal about Boren's departure. [...] At {{the conclusion of the}} 2009 Big Ten season, he was named to the All-Big Ten Conference team by both the coaches (second-team) and the media (first-team). [...] The following 2010 season, he repeated as a first team media and second team coaches All-Big Ten Conference selection. [...] He was named as a second team All-American selection by Associated Press, CBS Sports, Rivals.com and Scout.com.|$|E

Royals third base coach Luis Silverio and others restrained Guillén, while security escorted to a new seat in Kauffman Stadium. Guillén met with Royals general manager Dayton Moore to discuss Guillén's public outburst, his fourth of the season. Royals manager Trey Hillman {{did not see the}} incident take place.

2500|$|Among {{tactical}} debates {{within the}} party, Gramsci's group was mainly distinguished by its advocacy of workers' councils, which {{had come into}} existence in Turin spontaneously during the large strikes of 1919 and 1920. For Gramsci, these councils were the proper means of enabling workers {{to take control of}} the task of organising production. Although he believed his position at this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> keeping with Lenin's policy of [...] "All power to the Soviets", his stance that these Italian councils were communist, rather than just one organ of political struggle against the bourgeoisie, was attacked by Bordiga for betraying a syndicalist tendency influenced by the thought of Georges Sorel and Daniel DeLeon. By the time of the defeat of the Turin workers in spring 1920, Gramsci was almost alone in his defence of the councils.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Wingate was {{appointed}} the Deputy Secretary of the Foreign and Political Department of the Indian government.

[...] His first job was to help integrate the princely states into federation with the rest India in preparation for independence. [...] A particular challenge in the process involved determining how many representatives each of the states would have in the Constituent Assembly of India. [...] Wingate proposed [...] "a scheme based upon permutations and combinations of the number of guns which were fired to salute the categories of Indian princes". [...] The idea was acclaimed [...] "as a stroke of genius" [...] and adopted by the government.|$|E

2500|$|Squamish {{daily life}} is {{revolved}} around the village community. [...] Before contact, a village would consist of multiple dwellings called Longhouses, which would hold a large extended family. [...] Within a typical longhouse, different branches of an extended family would operate {{in different parts of}} the house. A standard house would be 30 feet wide, 40 feet long and from 19–13 feet high, but they could vary in size depending on how big the family was. [...] Within their territory many villages lived near resource or culturally significant places. [...] Kinship ties would connect each of the villages, and neighboring indigenous nations. [...] Salmon was the main staple of food, found at one <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> abundance in the area. [...] Other seafood such as herring, shell-fish, and seal.

Respondents in the study expressed their BDSM orientation to be built into who they are, but considered exploring their BDSM interests an ongoing task, and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners. The [...] "perfect match" [...] where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires. The BDSM activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain BDSM activities for [...] "couple bonding, stress release, and spiritual quests". The most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> role with most adopting a lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day.|$|E
