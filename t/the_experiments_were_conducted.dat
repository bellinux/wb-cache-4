25|$|A study {{published}} in Nature found that hydrogen peroxide {{plays a role in}} the immune system. Scientists found that hydrogen peroxide presence inside cells increased after tissues are damaged in zebrafish, which is thought to act as a signal to white blood cells to converge on the site and initiate the healing process. When the genes required to produce hydrogen peroxide were disabled, white blood cells did not accumulate at the site of damage. <b>The</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> on fish; however, because fish are genetically similar to humans, the same process is speculated to occur in humans. The study in Nature suggested asthma sufferers have higher levels of hydrogen peroxide in their lungs than healthy people, which could explain why asthma sufferers have inappropriate levels of white blood cells in their lungs.|$|E

50|$|Neutrino-related {{experiments}} were started in KGF in 1964. The main goal was {{the detection of}} atmospheric neutrinos, with an understanding that cosmic rays contain high energy pions and muons which decay in the Earth's atmosphere to produce billions of neutrinos. <b>The</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> by groups from TIFR, Durham University and Osaka University using basic trigger with scintillation counters and Neon Flash Tubes (NFT) for tracking detectors. Seven detectors were deployed {{at a depth of}} 2.3 km in Heathcote shaft and Champion Reefs mines.

One {{is making}} sodium chloride solutions and sampling water clusters from the solution {{and put the}} solution with water clusters on a glass slide under a microscope. The second method is to put a drop of Milli Q water on a glass slide under a microscope and put {{a grain of salt}} next to the water drop then push the salt grain inside the water drop. Under the microscope salt starts to dissolve and break into smaller salt particles. Some of the salt particles enter water clusters and reveals the appearance of water clusters.|$|E
50|$|Research by Hart Blanton has {{not found}} {{limitations}} because <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> under circumstances that favored the current theory. Blanton and Christie expect boundary conditions to become evident through future research {{and may be}} found to exist in situations where the individual is resistant to change. If an individual makes {{a conscious effort to}} resist a reference group's perceived attempt to alter the individual's behavior, it seems plausible that DRT could backfire. The same way that people key off of behavior from ingroups, people also observe and avoid normative behavior displayed by people in outgroups. In this context DRT could play the opposite role as an individual would avoid the observed normative behavior.|$|E

Initially <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> in concordance with James Randi {{as part of}} the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, later independently. The reward for proof of paranormal abilities is a prize money of 10,000 Euros. The testing procedure is agreed upon in advance between the applicant and the GWUP. Until 2010, around 30 candidates have applied to be tested for their psi abilities, most of them dowsers. As of 2014 no one has successfully passed the challenge. The most recent Psi test was conducted on August 12, 2013 in the University of Würzburg. Again no test person was able to verify any paranormal ability. The journalist and psychologist Sebastian Bartoschek observed this test.|$|E
