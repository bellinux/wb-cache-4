5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower courts}} had to revisit Booker's {{sentencing}} {{in light of}} the Supreme Court decision. Booker was re-sentenced by the same judge to the same 30-year sentence he originally received (longer than the 21-year sentence <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> have been able to impose had the guidelines not been made advisory); however, retroactive changes in crack cocaine guidelines meant Booker's sentence has been reduced slightly by a federal judge (from 30 to 27 years) and he has a projected release date of 20 June 2024.|$|E
25|$|At the prosecution's request, {{the judge}} issued {{a gag order}} forbidding the {{following}} parties {{to talk to the}} news media: the defendant, the prosecutor, defense counsel, any attorney working in their offices, their agents, staff, experts, any judicial officer or court employee, any law enforcement employee, and any agency involved in the case or any persons subpoenaed or expected to testify. The purpose was to prevent people among whom a jury would be selected from being influenced. However, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> consider proposals to allow either side to answer reporters' questions about rumors surrounding the case.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{inclusion}} of this round, <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> <b>would</b> have a list containing a number of acts which advanced past the auditions during each live show. <b>The</b> <b>judges</b> <b>would</b> then pick ten acts from that group each week, leaving several acts without the chance to perform.|$|R

25|$|The {{court was}} set up like a magistrate's court, with a {{barrister}} presiding as a judge and another barrister acting as a permanent prosecutor. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> hold temporary military rank, and would normally act as the sole decider of both fact and sentence; if the potential sentence was more than two years, up to five other officers would also sit as judges. The defendant could be represented by any legal counsel, British or German, and the court could work in both the English and German languages. The court heard 4,295 cases between 1919 and 1925, with possible sentences for minor offences including fines and prison sentences of between seven and fourteen days, normally served in a standard German prison. Most cases were about possessing weapons illegally, straying onto British property, occupying carriages in trains reserved for British officers, reckless driving and possessing British Government property. The courts were well attended by German civilians, and German lawyers also attended to make a study of British legal procedure.|$|E

2500|$|Part {{of being}} a good {{reporter}} is to be anonymous, {{to stay out of}} the story so that you can better watch and study and listen to the principals. [...] She couldn't do that, mostly because people wouldn't let her. [...] She'd walk into a trial and the prosecutor would ask for her autograph for his wife or <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> send out greetings.|$|E

2500|$|Third, the Rules {{expressly}} {{provided that}} <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> make the threshold determination regarding whether certain scientific knowledge would indeed assist the {{trier of fact}} in the manner contemplated by Rule 702. [...] "This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly {{can be applied to}} the facts in issue." [...] This preliminary assessment can turn on whether something has been tested, whether an idea has been subjected to scientific peer review or published in scientific journals, the rate of error involved in the technique, and even general acceptance, among other things. It focuses on methodology and principles, not the ultimate conclusions generated.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{not guilty}} verdict on {{the count of}} murdering Morrell, the normal process {{would have been to}} bring the {{indictment}} regarding Mrs Hullett to trial, either a full trial or, in view of the acquittal in Mrs Morrell's case, so that Adams would plead not guilty, the Attorney-General would offer no evidence and <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> direct the jury to bring in a not guilty verdit, the course Devlin expected. However the Attorney-General, as a minister of the Crown had the power to suspend an indictment through a nolle prosequi, something which Devlin said had never been used to prevent an accused from an acquittal, suggesting this was done because Manningham-Buller did not want a second acquittal and the loss of both the cases he had indicted. Nolle prosequi could legitimately be used in cases to protect a guilty person granted immunity to turn Queen's evidence [...] or to save the lives of the innocent, or sometimes on compassionate grounds.|$|E
2500|$|Eight {{books of}} records made by nurses {{who had worked}} under Adams were {{recorded}} in pre-trial police records but disappeared before the trial started, depriving Manningham-Buller of the chance to familiarise himself with them. He was presented with only a copy of them by the defence {{on the second day}} of the trial. These books were then used by the fully prepared defence to counter evidence given against Adams by the nurses, who had originally written the notes. Six years after the event, the notes could be said to be more reliable than the nurses' own memories. The defence was not required to explain how the books came into their hands, and the Attorney-General made no effort to pursue this matter, despite his nickname of [...] "Sir Bullying Manner". He also failed to ask for an adjournment to acquaint himself with the new evidence – despite the fact that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> have been sure to grant it.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} if a witness accused someone of worshipping an idol, <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> <b>would</b> ask, among other questions, whether the accused worshiped Peor (as [...] reports that the Israelites did).|$|R

2500|$|In {{what became}} a regular (though not continuous) {{occurrence}} throughout the trial, Judge Akubzhanov berated Chikatilo as he questioned him in detail {{as to the}} charges; ordering him to [...] "shut your mouth", before adding, [...] "You're not crazy!" [...] as Chikatilo's responses to questions deviated into his discussing {{issues such as the}} repression his family had endured throughout his childhood, and his claiming that the charges filed against him were false. These verbal exchanges between Chikatilo and <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> occur whether Chikatilo was cooperative or uncooperative throughout proceedings, {{and the manner in which}} the judge questioned Chikatilo repeatedly led Chikatilo's defence lawyer, Marat Khabibulin, to protest against the accusatory nature of the court proceedings. In the instances in which Chikatilo was uncooperative throughout questioning, he would simply shout over the judge, denounce the court as a farce, and launch into rambling, disjointed speeches. On occasion, Chikatilo would also expose himself to the court, or sing socialist movement anthems throughout proceedings. These antics regularly resulted in his being returned to his cell as court proceedings continued in his absence.|$|E
2500|$|Imagine {{that both}} Smith and Jones violate the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), which forbids obstructing, delaying, or {{affecting}} commerce or {{the movement of}} any article or commodity in commerce by extortion. [...] Smith threatens to injure a co-worker if the co-worker does not advance him a few dollars from the interstate company's till. [...] Jones threatens to injure a co-worker unless the co-worker advances him {{a few thousand dollars}} from the company's accounts, and reinforces this threat by [...] "making certain that the co-worker's family is aware of the threat, by arranging deliveries of various dead animals to the co-worker's home to show that he is serious, and so forth." [...] Both Smith and Jones, although they violated the same statute, created different harms {{as a result of their}} actions. [...] Under the Guidelines, their sentences would be different. [...] If the jury factfinding requirement were merely grafted onto the Guidelines scheme, unless prosecutors [...] "decide to charge more than the elements of the crime," [...] <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> have to impose similar punishments.|$|E
2500|$|The ACLU had {{originally}} intended to oppose the Butler Act {{on the grounds that}} it violated the teacher's individual rights and academic freedom, and was therefore unconstitutional. Principally because of Clarence Darrow, this strategy changed as the trial progressed. The earliest argument proposed by the defense once the trial had begun was that there was actually no conflict between evolution and the creation account in the Bible; later, this viewpoint would be called theistic evolution. In support of this claim, they brought in eight experts on evolution. But other than Dr. Maynard Metcalf, a zoologist from Johns Hopkins University, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> not allow these experts to testify in person. Instead, they were allowed to submit written statements so that their evidence could be used at the appeal. In response to this decision, Darrow made a sarcastic comment to Judge Raulston (as he often did throughout the trial) on how he had been agreeable only on the prosecution's suggestions. [...] Darrow apologized the next day, keeping himself from being found in contempt of court.|$|E

2500|$|She and her {{half-sister}} became heiresses {{to a half}} share each in a $5 million ($ million today) {{trust fund}} upon her father's death from cirrhosis when she was 18 months old. The rights to control this trust fund while Vanderbilt was a minor belonged to her mother, who traveled to and from Paris for years, taking her daughter with her. They were accompanied by a beloved nanny – Emma Sullivan Kieslich, whom young Gloria had named [...] "Dodo" [...] – who would play a tumultuous part in the child's life, and her mother's identical twin sister, Thelma, who was the mistress of the Prince of Wales during this time. As a result of frequent spending, her mother's use of finances was scrutinized by the child Vanderbilt's paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. [...] A sculptor and philanthropist, Whitney wanted custody of her niece, {{which resulted in a}} famous custody trial. The trial was so scandalous that at times <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> make everyone leave the room so as to listen to what young Vanderbilt had to say without anyone influencing her. Some people heard weeping and wailing inside the court room. Testimony was heard depicting the mother as an unfit parent; Vanderbilt's mother lost the battle and Vanderbilt became the ward of her aunt Gertrude.|$|E
2500|$|The socialite was {{influenced}} by minister Marty Angelo in jail, referring to a [...] "new beginning" [...] {{in an interview with}} talk-show host Larry King on June 28, 2007 (two days after her release) and quoting from Angelo's autobiography (Once Life Matters: A New Beginning). On June 9, Angelo unsuccessfully petitioned Sauer to let him serve the remainder of Hilton's sentence if <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> release her to an alternative treatment program. Hilton told King during the interview that she had taken Adderall for ADHD since childhood. Due to her incarceration, The Simple Life finished its run {{at the end of its}} fifth season in July 2007. In early August, Hilton signed a licensing agreement with Antebi for a signature footwear line (Paris Hilton Footwear, featuring stilettos, platforms, flats, wedges and a sports collection) which was expected to reach stores in 2008. In mid-August, she introduced a line of tops, dresses, coats and jeans at the Kitson Boutique in Los Angeles. Hilton called the event [...] "a dream come true", describing the clothing line as [...] "fun, bright and flashy". In December 2007 she posed nude (covered with gold paint) to promote [...] "Rich Prosecco", a canned version of the Italian sparkling wine, traveling to Germany to appear in print ads for the wine.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Fourth Lateran Council, {{the civil}} and common law courts quickly moved to ban trial by ordeal and trial by combat. Implementation {{proved to be}} more difficult. [...] What would take their place? [...] The novel choice was trial by jury. [...] In many places this change was seen as radical, and was met with great doubts about its effectiveness. [...] There was {{reluctance}} to accept juries on a large scale by many of the English courts, and the public at large. [...] People were used to a system where decisions were made by the outcome of a duel or an ordeal. [...] The jury system had made a sporadic appearance in England from time to time, including, but not limited to Danelaw and the Saxons. Even so, juries had never been predominant. [...] A jury remained a local and obscure phenomenon. [...] It was generally believed that God's will was revealed in the outcome of the battle or ordeal. [...] The fact that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> view the result of the ordeal and declare [...] "God's decision" [...] had little bearing on the validity of the procedure. The jury was something else. It did not represent God and its twelve or more members were likely to fail to deliver God's solution.|$|E

50|$|Starting {{with second}} series of prime shows, another change was introduced. Two {{candidates}} {{would be eliminated}} by public vote, but <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> <b>would</b> be given <b>the</b> opportunity to save one of the Bottom 4 {{to move on to}} the next round.|$|R
50|$|Each heat five contestants {{would take}} the stage.

The scores would then be added and the act with the most combined score would gain first place and advance to the semi-finals.(In the event of a tie the act with the most viewer votes would take higher ranking.) From the 2nd and 3rd placed acts <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> <b>would</b> choose an act to send through to the wildcard show.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a matter}} of procedure, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> {{question}} the plaintiff {{in order to bring}} out the cause of the complaint. [...] Once this was accomplished, the subsequent proceeding under the bill would be carried out as if there was a legitimate writ. [...] By the 15th century, the bill would typically pray that a subpoena should be issued to secure the appearance and examination of the defendant. [...] At the bottom of the bill were the names of the pledges to prosecute. [...] These were similar to the bills issued by the Court of Eyre. [...] Those subpoenas issued in Chancery at the time of Henry VI of England were required to have a pledge attached. [...] Statute at that time prohibited the issue of a writ of subpoena until the plaintiff had found sureties to satisfy the defendant's damages if he did not prevail in his case. [...] When the defendant appeared, both the plaintiff and his witnesses, and the defendant and any witnesses which he might produce, were examined by the Chancellor. [...] Production of documents could be demanded via subpoena duces tecum. [...] It has been suggested that the writ subpoena was very similar to the bill of Eyre. [...] However, in the opinions of Professor Adams, Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet and Professor Powicke, it is erroneous to conclude that the writ subpoena came from the Bill of Eyre. [...] It came from Chancery.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{cited the}} Torah's {{requirement}} for corroborating witnesses {{to support the}} Mishnah's prohibition of circumstantial evidence in capital cases. The Mishnah reported that they admonished witnesses in capital cases not to testify based on conjecture (that is, circumstantial evidence) or hearsay, for the court would scrutinize the witnesses' evidence by cross-examination and inquiry.. The Gemara reported that the Rabbis taught that the words [...] "based on conjecture" [...] in the Mishnah meant that the judge told the witness that if the witness saw the defendant running after the victim into a ruin, and the witness pursued the defendant and found the defendant with bloody sword in hand and the victim writhing in agony, then <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> tell the witness that the witness saw nothing (and did not actually witness a murder).
