Two were used: Bodie drove a silver version (1978-1981 episodes), Doyle a gold (1980-81 episodes), {{in the first}} season a silver Mk II with a black vinyl roof and a Series X bodykit was also briefly used, the first two cars {{mentioned}} still exist and were saved from being scrapped and restored in the 1990s but {{the existence of the}} silver Mk II driven by Bodie is still uncertain and debated. Cowley used a latest model Ford Granada (1978-1981 Ghia model) while other Ford models such as a Ford Escort RS2000 (1978-79 episodes, driven by Doyle) and the Ford Cortina, particularly the Mark V (TF) model, were occasionally seen. However, in the first (1977) series, the cars used were mainly those of British Leyland, including a Rover SD1, a Rover P6, a Princess, a Triumph 2000, a Triumph Dolomite Sprint and a Triumph TR7. The SD1, a <b>turmeric</b> <b>yellow</b> 3500, bore the registration MOO 229R; in The New Avengers John Steed drove an identical-looking car with the number MOC 229P. The producers of The Professionals DVDs have speculated that these may in fact have been one and the same car.|$|E

[...] "The act of rehearsing a text from modern history and meditating on its relevance today is charged with a revisionary historicism: Kallat simultaneously places the text within its particular historical moment and reinvigorates it for present purposes," [...] art historian Chaitanya Sambrani wrote in an essay titled Of Bones and Salt: Jitish Kallat's Public Notice 2. [...] "The first activity, that of historical situation, locates the text securely in the past; the second asks us to reconsider it so as to glean an insight into present exigences and possibilities for the future."

30|$|There were {{types of}} dyes {{characteristic}} of either Persian velvets or Indian velvets, {{although there were}} some exceptions, and some dyes commonly used in both productions. The characteristic dyes used for Persian velvets were cochineal for red pile samples, yellow larkspur and UYD-A for yellow samples. The cochineal species used on those samples were not determined in this study. For Indian velvets, lac was used for red pile samples and <b>turmeric</b> for <b>yellow</b> samples. A combination of yellow larkspur and indigo dye used to dye green samples was relatively common to the both productions. Safflower, soluble redwood such as sappanwood and indigo and tannin dyes were used for both productions. A combination {{of two or three}} dyes was often used to create one color in both productions. Those velvets which did not show this tendency are remarked in the Additional file 1. Those velvets were confusing to differentiate as either Persian or Indian velvet, based on dyes used on the velvets, because both productions used dyes more characteristic of the other’s culture.|$|R

During the ceremony, people offer alms to monks and candles to Wat Phra Phutthabat, early in the morning. In the afternoon, they offer flowers to the monks at Wat Phra Phutthabat Ratchaworamahawihan, Khun Khlon Sub-district, Phra Phutthabat District. They go to collect a kind of flower similar to Krachai (Rotunda) or <b>turmeric</b> with <b>yellow</b> or white flowers called [...] "The Flower of Buddhist Lent". This herb-like flower is found on the hillside only during the Buddhist Lent period and only in Saraburi. While the monks are walking up the staircase to take the flowers to pay homage to the Lord Buddha's footprint, people wait along the steps with bowls of clean water in which are floated bullet wood flowers. They pour the water onto the feet of the monks as a means of washing away their sins. The Flower of Buddhist Lent was listed as a new species of plant in the world in the International Flowers Fair in July 2001 at Jurong Bird Park in Singapore.|$|R

Of these, Nagamandala is the {{longer and more}} colourful of the two.Nagamandala depicts the divine union {{of male and female}} snakes. It is generally performed by two priests. The first priest, called patri, inhales the areca flower and becomes the male snake. The second priest, called Nagakannika or the female snake dances and swings around an elaborate serpent design drawn with natural colours on the sacred ground. The ritual is supplemented by playing an hour glass shaped instrument called as Dakke. The drawings in five different colours on the sacred ground are white (white mud), red (mix of lime powder and turmeric powder), green (green leaves powder), <b>yellow</b> (<b>turmeric</b> powder) and black (roasted and powdered paddy husk).

50|$|When a girl or {{a married}} woman visits a house, {{it is a sign}} of respect (in case of an elderly lady) or blessings (in case of a young girl) to offer kumkuma to them when they leave. However, it is not offered to widows. When visiting a temple, married women from {{southern}} India usually dip their ring finger in <b>yellow</b> <b>turmeric</b> powder, and apply a dot on their neck. Men, women, girls, and boys apply a dot on their forehead of red turmeric powder, also when visiting a temple or during a pooja. Kumkuma in temples is found in heaps. People dip their thumb into the heap and apply it on the forehead or between the eyebrows. In most of India, married women apply red kumkuma to the parting of their hair above their forehead every day as a symbol of marriage. This is called vermilion, or in Hindi, sindoor. In southern India, many unmarried girls will wear a bindi every day unlike northern India where it is only worn as a symbol of marriage.|$|R
40|$|Background: Turmeric is a {{plant that}} belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, {{and is one of}} the main {{ingredients}} in curry powder. Turmeric is often called the golden spice and has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years. Curcumin, which gives <b>turmeric</b> its <b>yellow</b> color, has been confirmed to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infectious effects. It is also known to prevent dementia and promote liver health. For these reasons, turmeric is regarded as a therapeutic food additive with many health benefits beyond its nutritional value. In this paper, the health benefits of turmeric were examined through human intervention studies. Methods: Thirty chosen individuals (28 men and 2 women) with slightly elevated alanine aminotransaminase levels consumed 1  g of turmeric powder (TP) as two capsules after each meal, three times a day, during the test period of 12 weeks. Changes in the lipid profile and in the levels of serum glucose, malondialdehyde, and metabolites in the sera were measured prior to and after TP consumption. Results: The participants exhibited dyslipidemia, fasting hyperglycemia, and oxidative stress prior to TP treatment, and these symptoms were alleviated after treatment. On metabolomics analysis of sera, levels of branch-chained amino acids (valine and leucine/isoleucine) were decreased, whereas those of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan and phenylalanine) were increased. Pronounced changes were also noted in the levels of total lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and acylcarnitine: the levels of total lysoPC were decreased whereas those of acylcarnitine were increased. Serum levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine, which are intermediates of purine degradation, were increased in the participants, although that of the final product, uric acid, was decreased. Conclusion: Oral consumption of TP alleviated dyslipidemia and changed metabolites patterns by accelerating metabolic activities with less oxidative stress in participants with mild liver dysfunction...|$|R

From such beginnings, man being guided by the instincts of the lower animals and the intuition of the best among his own species, has evolved the present complex system of the healing science {{in the service of}} health and life that finds its appropriateness in the context of cattle farming too. Even though the modern developments in therapeutic field brought about a rapid decline in traditional medicine, the plant-based remedies are still having a crucial role as potential source of therapeutic aids in health systems all over the world for both humans and animals. Nowadays immune-based therapies are gaining more importance than monovalent approaches which are having limited benefits. As far as the cattle industry is concerned, herbal plants are used as health promoters {{and at the same time}} for the treatment of diseases. Herbs are used variously for infections as anthelmintic and acaricidals and have got implications in surgical and gynaecological interventions as well as in bovine mastitis. Apart from the aforesaid uses, an array of herbal plants have been reported which are having immunomodulatory effects like modulation of cytokine secretion, histamine release, immunoglobulin secretion, class switching, cellular co receptor expression, lymphocyte expression, phagocytosis, and so on.

ARPE- 19 cells were divided into four main groups, such as control, cur, blue light, and cur[*]+[*]blue light. Results were evaluated by Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests as post hoc tests. The cells in cur and cur[*]+[*]blue light samples were incubated with 20  μM cur. Blue light exposure was performed for 24  h in an incubator. Lipid peroxidation and cytosolic-free Ca 2 + [Ca 2 +] i concentrations were higher in the blue light exposure samples than in the control samples; however, their levels were determined as significantly lower in the cur and cur[*]+[*]blue light exposure samples than in the blue light samples alone. PARP and procaspase- 3 levels were significantly higher in blue light samples. Cur administration significantly decreased PARP and procaspase- 3 expression levels. Reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase values were lower in the blue light exposure samples, although they were higher in the cur and cur[*]+[*]blue light exposure samples. Caspase- 3 and - 9 activities were lower in the cur samples than in the blue light samples. Moreover, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were significantly higher in the blue light exposure samples.

In this study we discuss about the nature of Nylon as a textile material and its dyability with a natural dye to achieve a world renowned customer (Marks & Spencer) standards. Here we have considered Turmeric (Curcuma Zanga) as the example. As a textile material, nylon yarns are widely used in the industry. In the textile market nylon is used 80 - 90 % from the total volume for under wear and sportswear.

5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; <b>turmeric</b> provided a <b>yellow</b> substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|R

Leroy nodded appreciatively as he continued eating. Then, looking up from the bowl, he said: “Honey, you did say that you added turmeric, right? I thought that <b>turmeric</b> has a <b>yellow</b> color. I know that it is used in both curry and mustard, and it’s what gives them both their characteristic yellow color. But this lentil soup has an orange tinge, not a yellow color, ” Leroy observed. “Well, let me explain what happened. I started making the soup in the traditional way. I added all the ingredients and a good sprinkling of turmeric. The boiling mixture became yellow. But the baby started crying, and so I turned the stove off and attended to her. After a while, she went to sleep and I turned the stove back on and continued boiling the lentils. But then I looked at the clock and realized you would be home in about 15 minutes and that the soup would probably not be done by then. The lentils were still uncooked! So I added some baking soda.
