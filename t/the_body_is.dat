5|$|Adult Potamon fluviatile {{may reach}} a {{carapace}} length of , with females being generally smaller than males. As with other crabs, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> roughly square, with the reduced abdomen tucked beneath the thorax. The thorax bears five pairs of legs, {{the first of}} which is armed with large claws.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{first put}} {{on display in}} the Eden Museum. Because it drew such large crowds city {{authorities}} insisted that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>be</b> moved and closed <b>the</b> exhibit. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> then became part of a freak show in a Montreal circus. When the show went bankrupt <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and left in a warehouse. In 1907, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found by a group of children. It was subsequently claimed by the University of Montreal for research purposes. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later mummified and put on display in a glass case.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found {{buried in}} a wooden coffin, wrapped in lead sheet. Despite the lead sheet being damaged at the foot end, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> in a {{remarkable}} state of preservation. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> wrapped in two shrouds, which are {{on display in the}} priory. Since <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> identity <b>was</b> unknown, he was dubbed [...] "St Bees Man".|$|R
50|$|In Jainism, perfect souls with <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> called arihant ("victors") {{and perfect}} souls without <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> called Siddhas ("liberated souls").|$|R
5|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} – With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, {{such as the}} muscles of one limb, {{one side of the}} body or the lower half of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Modesty, of the {{feelings}} as well as <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> discreet in choice of words and clothing.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the risk factors are markedly different.|$|E
50|$|In October 2014, a dead <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{found at}} <b>the</b> mall, {{causing it to}} be closed for a day while <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> investigated. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} determined to be a night shift custodian.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, Borremose man was {{discovered}} by peat diggers in the southernmost part of Borremose. First {{thought to be a}} murder victim, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later determined to <b>be</b> a bog <b>body.</b> <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found a half metre down beneath a layer of birch sticks. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> naked and two sheepskin coats and a woven cap lay beside it.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> formed of alloy panels {{rivetted}} {{on a light}} steel frame. Roof {{plates were}} crimped to increase rigidity. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> suspended from four points on the frame, connected by hydraulic shock absorbers.|$|R
5|$|The Ganeshida have a pair {{of small}} oral lobes and {{a pair of}} tentacles. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{circular}} rather than oval in cross-section, and the pharynx extends over the inner surfaces of the lobes.|$|E
5|$|The only grave {{goods were}} a pot found {{with the female}} adult body and partial remains of wicker, fur and linen with the other bodies. In the predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and {{sometimes}} loosely wrapped. In such a burial, when <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> covered in warm sand, the environmental conditions mean {{that most of the}} water in <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> quickly evaporated or drained away, meaning that the corpse is naturally dried and preserved. This method was widely used in the pre-dynastic Egyptian period, before artificial mummification was developed. The natural mummification that occurred with these dry sand burials may have led to the original Egyptian belief in an after-death survival and started the tradition of leaving food and implements for an afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
50|$|According to the {{testimony}} of survivors, the executions were carried out in groups and <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> then taken by truck to the old cemetery, where <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> burned and then deposited in mass graves.|$|R
50|$|In August 2015 {{fishermen}} in Burundi living {{around the lake}} in the Muyinga Province recovered over 40 unidentified <b>bodies</b> floating in <b>the</b> lake. Most of <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> wrapped in plastic flow into Burundi from Rwanda with the Kagera River. <b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> recovered <b>were</b> in <b>the</b> advance stages of decomposition, alarming the local villagers due to health concerns. Burundi claims that all <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> recovered <b>were</b> Rwandan by nationality {{and there are no}} credible conclusions to how <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> killed. Both countries deny that <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> their citizens. <b>The</b> Federal Bureau of Investigation from the United States agreed to take the case after both countries showed lack of interest to look into the matter.|$|R
50|$|Alexander Lindsay, 25th Earl of Crawford died in 1880 and his <b>body</b> <b>was</b> stolen in 1881. His <b>body</b> had <b>been</b> {{removed from}} a burial vault within the private chapel but the removal of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> not {{discovered}} until several months later after a note signed 'Nabob' was received. After extensive searches <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> eventually found on 18 July 1882 near a gravel pit close to <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later transported to Haigh Hall and buried again in the family vault.|$|R
5|$|After {{the family}} obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a funeral {{director}} (also {{known as an}} undertaker) who collects the body, embalms it if necessary, and delivers it to the wake. In addition, they {{have to decide whether}} <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose right side of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai {{is one of the}} rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where right side of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> the male Shiva and left side is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> cremated.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> about 600 years old, his nails, {{skin and}} stomach {{contents}} {{were found to}} be in near-perfect condition.The lead sheet in which <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> wrapped excluded moisture whilst the beeswax coating of the shroud excluded air.|$|R

5|$|As in all insects, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} three sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is {{composed}} of three segments, each {{with a pair of}} legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.|$|E
5|$|At {{night just}} outside Paris, a woman drives along a {{riverbank}} and dumps a corpse in the river. After <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> recovered, Dr. Génessier identifies the remains {{as those of}} his missing daughter, Christiane Génessier, whose face was horribly disfigured {{in an automobile accident}} that occurred before her disappearance, for which her father was responsible. Dr. Génessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged German Shepherds and other large dogs.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
500|$|Budge {{excavated}} all <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> from <b>the</b> same grave site. Two {{were identified}} as male and one as female, with the others being of undetermined gender. <b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> given to <b>the</b> British Museum in 1900. Some grave-goods were documented {{at the time of}} excavation as [...] "pots and flints", however they were not passed on to the British Museum and their whereabouts remain unknown. Three of <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> found with coverings of different types (reed matting, palm fibre and an animal skin), which still remain with <b>the</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> found in foetal positions lying on their left sides.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{place where}} <b>the</b> boy's <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found {{seems to be}} unclear. According to the Catholic {{historian}} Cölestin Wolfsgrüber, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found in a ditch.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} following {{historical research}} that included analysis of aerial photographs showing {{the presence of}} mass graves {{on the edge of}} Pheasant Wood (Bois Faisan), just outside the village of Fromelles. The presence of <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>was</b> confirmed in May 2008, and <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> recovered during excavation work in 2009. A specially convened Identification Board published a report on 17 March 2010 announcing <b>the</b> first 75 <b>bodies</b> to have <b>been</b> successfully identified using DNA analysis. [...] Further identification continued until at least 2014.|$|R
5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in <b>the</b> <b>body),</b> <b>is</b> a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such {{as the use of}} central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E
50|$|Their <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> decapitated, {{and then}} <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> ground up.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> would <b>be</b> left {{until their}} clothes rotted or even until <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> almost {{completely}} decomposed, {{after which the}} bones would be scattered.|$|R
50|$|A {{skeleton}} {{was found}} on the island in July 1988. Further examination of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> suggested that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> Corporal Carl Houston of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, who was last seen hiking on the isle on March 3, 1945. Along with <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>were</b> found a M-1 rifle and several spent shells.|$|R
