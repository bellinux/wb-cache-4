Previous {{research}} into <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> eating disordered individuals {{appears to have}} focused almost exclusively on <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> anorexics. In view of {{the problems associated with}} the conceptualization of bulimia as a syndrome distinct from anorexia nervosa, it seems possible that {{research into}} <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> anorexics may have included <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> bulimics. Following <b>the</b> introductory overview of some of the literature on bulimia, highlighting the lack of diagnostic clarity in this area, previous research into <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> both anorexics and bulimics is reviewed. In view of the lack of documented research into <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> bulimics from a systems perspective, the present study aimed to explore these families' functioning. Family functioning was assessed according to <b>the</b> McMaster Model <b>of</b> <b>Family</b> Functioning (Epstein and Bishop, 1981) : clinical interviews with 13 bulimics provided qualitative data on their families' functioning: quantitative data were elicited from <b>the</b> <b>family</b> members <b>of</b> 10 of these bulimics by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> Assessment Device (Epstein and Bishop, 1983). Clinical assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> bulimics reveals unhealthy <b>family</b> functioning. <b>The</b> ratings <b>of</b> all <b>family</b> members {{as well as those of}} the researcher indicate that there is familial dysfunction on all dimensions <b>of</b> <b>family</b> functioning. <b>The</b> main emphases in these families appears to be on instrumental issues, while affective issues are inappropriately handled. Discussion centres on the findings of the present study, which show some variance with the results of previous research into <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> anorexics; and an understanding of bulimia from a systems perspective is presented...|$|R
