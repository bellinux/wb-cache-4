He only appeared in three games (and didn't even have a plate appearance) before the Tigers attempted to outright him to <b>the</b> <b>minors.</b> Instead of going to <b>the</b> <b>minors,</b> Torres requested his release. He was granted free agency on April 22.|$|E

His Louisiana home was destroyed in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, whereupon he then lived in Lakeview, New Orleans.|$|E

The NHL was only six teams and players who didn't toe the line {{could easily be}} demoted to the minor leagues and a {{replacement}} found.

However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in <b>the</b> <b>minors,</b> he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E

5|$|López {{attended}} the University of Virginia, earning {{a degree in}} psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career. He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He {{began his career as}} a starting pitcher but struggled, and was converted into a sidearm (or submarine) reliever while still in the Diamondbacks' organization. Before the 2003 season, he was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 draft, but was traded to the Colorado Rockies during spring training. He spent all of 2003 on Colorado's roster, nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games pitched. He struggled the next two seasons, getting claimed off waivers and later sent to <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> by Arizona in 2005. In 2006, he signed with the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> before getting traded to Boston during the year.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} <b>the</b> <b>minors,</b> Crozier adopted the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, {{which he would}} later use during his NHL career. This technique was popularized by Glenn Hall and was improved upon by Crozier. Initially, his minor league coaches tried to convince him to abandon this style, thinking {{that it would never}} succeed in the NHL. Crozier also added an element of acrobacy in his game.|$|E
5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants in 2004, Sánchez quickly {{worked his way through}} the Giants' minor league system. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues and was used mostly in a long relief role. In 2007, he made the team out of spring {{training}} and was again used mostly in long relief, though he spent part of his season in <b>the</b> <b>minors.</b> In 2008, he made the Giants' starting rotation and remained in it for the entire year, except for a stint on the disabled list.|$|E

40|$|An 81 -year-old male {{was found}} to have a {{duodenal}} tumor by screening upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The tumor was located in <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> duodenal papilla. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed adenocarcinoma, and endoscopic ultrasound showed an elevated hypoechoic mass in <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> duodenal papilla. <b>The</b> preoperative diagnosis was therefore considered to be either adenocarcinoma of <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> duodenal papilla or duodenal cancer. We performed a subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed the tumor cells to be primarily located in the submucosa of <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> duodenal papilla, with slight invasion into the pancreatic parenchyma through the accessory pancreatic duct. We therefore diagnosed a primary adenocarcima of <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> duodenal papilla. Adenocarcinoma of <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> duodenal papilla {{is considered to be a}} rare disease, but it may be underestimated because of the difficulty in distinguishing advanced adenocarcinoma of <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> duodenal papilla from primary duodenal cancer and cancer of the pancreatic head...|$|R
5|$|After graduating {{high school}} in East St. Louis, Blake played in the farm system of the nearby St. Louis Cardinals before enlisting in the army.

He pitched for them {{on and off for}} three years, then spent the next six years pitching for the Toronto Maple Leafs. His last major league appearance was a stint with the Athletics in 1957, and two years later his professional baseball career ended. After retirement he became a plumber, and died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Because Koufax's {{signing bonus}} {{was greater than}} $4,000 ($ today), {{he was known as}} a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster {{for at least two years}} before he could be sent to <b>the</b> <b>minors.</b> To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger {{pitching}} staff.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, {{the band}} had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in {{temporarily}} for Hasler (who {{had taken over}} vocals when McPherson was removed). Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and bass player Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively. After briefly changing their name to Morris and <b>the</b> <b>Minors,</b> the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979, paying homage {{to one of their}} favourite songs by ska/reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and dancer.|$|E

5|$|Feldman, had microfracture surgery {{performed}} {{on his right}} knee during the off-season. To rehab, he made two appearances for the Double-A Frisco Roughriders and eight appearances for the Triple-A Round Rock Express. On July 8, he was transferred from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day disabled list. He was outrighted to <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> on July 13. However, on July 14, after he cleared waivers, Feldman rejected the assignment giving the Rangers the option of activating him from the disabled list or releasing him.

5|$|He {{returned}} to the Mexican League in 1947 and 1948 for the financial remuneration, but, comparatively speaking, the venture was unsuccessful for Day, who finished with a combined record of 18–20 and a 4.00 ERA. Following his departure from the Negro leagues in 1950, Day spent a season with the semi-professional Winnipeg Buffalos of the Mandak League. Finally, in 1951 Day made his debut in organized baseball, albeit in <b>the</b> <b>minors,</b> with the Toronto Maple Leafs, a Triple-A club that Day tallied a 1–1 record with in 14 games. Day also played for two other teams in the farm system, the Scranton Miners and the Edmonton Eskimos, before retiring from professional baseball in 1955.|$|E
