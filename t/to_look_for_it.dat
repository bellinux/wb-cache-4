Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks {{in the door and}} struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a flashlight. Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Ferguson (Lee) {{meets with}} James Hurley and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) at the RR Diner. They discuss Laura's death; Hurley and Hayward believe Laura hid a diary {{at her home}} and want Ferguson, who is now staying there, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> They leave as Jennings and Shelly arrive; Hank is seated at another table and pulls Jennings aside to ask to start working in order to regain her trust. Meanwhile, using a {{photograph}} from Renault's home and the clues from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log cabin in the woods that {{they believe to be}} the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper finds a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip that matches the piece found in Laura's stomach, and Truman finds Waldo, the caged myna bird.|$|E

25|$|After Voldemort's death, Harry {{uses the}} Elder Wand to repair his own damaged wand, then decides {{to return it}} to Dumbledore's tomb, {{so that when he}} has a natural death, the Elder Wand's power will die with him. In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too {{powerful}} to fall into the wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest but decides not <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the hope that no wizard or witch {{will ever be able to}} own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.|$|E
25|$|Zelena and Arthur are in {{the woods}} and come upon the witch’s home and is met by a giant wolf, only to have Zelena throws some {{sleeping}} powder on it to make it sleepy. The witch appears and says she won’t be as easy to subdue. Arthur asks for the magic helm and the witch says she already sent someone <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Zelena holds her head near the cauldron and threatens her and the witch says Merida has it. Arthur is shocked that Merida escaped and Zelena promises to make her pay. They then show up with Zelena demanding it while Merida asks why everyone wants it. Arthur says it has the power to make other men fight your battle and says he needs it but Merida says her father wouldn’t use magic to fight his battles. Mulan says they need the helm to protect their people but they don’t have it. Zelena takes Merida's bow to use as a tracking device, and tells her she can console herself with the memories of what a terrible ruler {{he turned out to be}} then tells Arthur they can use it to track the helm and they disappear.|$|E
500|$|In equal {{protection}} cases, {{the purpose of}} the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged. When {{the purpose of the}} law is not explicitly stated, the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose, assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> or draw some inferences as to what it is. When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated, the court may either accept it at face value; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration, looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose. In the latter situation, what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation. The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the [...] "thornier aspects of judicial review", because it must either [...] "uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value" [...] or [...] "challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference". The court must then [...] "make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end".|$|E

2500|$|Soult {{also ordered}} Ney to attack across the Tagus at Almaraz and sent maps of a ford near that location. However, though the ford existed, the maps were in error. Ney sent {{a party of}} dragoons <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but they never found it. In fact, Craufurd's {{defenders}} {{were aware of the}} ford and troops were in a good position to defend it. The Almaraz ford was no less than [...] deep, narrow, and barely usable.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespearean scholar Helen Vendler characterizes Sonnet 65 as a [...] "defective key word" [...] sonnet. [...] Often, Shakespeare {{will use}} a {{particular}} word prominently in each quatrain, prompting the reader <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the couplet and note any change in usage. [...] Here, however, he repeats the words [...] "hold" [...] and [...] "strong" [...] (modified slightly to [...] "stronger" [...] in Q1), but omits them in the couplet, thus rendering them [...] "defective." [...] Vendler claims that these key words are replaced by [...] "miracle" [...] and [...] "black ink" [...] respectively in the quatrain, citing as evidence the shift of focus from organic to inorganic, which parallels the same shift occurring more broadly from the octave to the sestet, {{as well as the}} presence of the letters i, a, c, and l visually yoking miracle to black ink. [...] Stephen Booth supports this line of criticism, noting the juxtaposition of [...] "hand" [...] and [...] "foot" [...] in line 11, suggesting someone being tripped up and perhaps mirroring the shift to come in the couplet.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Jack {{describes}} his thrilling adventure after he returns from climbing the beanstalk {{and finding a}} castle of two married giants, whom he robbed unnoticed ("Giants in the Sky"). He gives the Baker five gold pieces he stole from the giants to buy back his cow. When the Baker hesitates, Jack climbs back up the beanstalk to find more. The Mysterious Man emerges and taunts the Baker, stealing the money. The Baker's Wife confesses she has lost the cow, and she and the Baker split up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Cinderella's Prince and Rapunzel's Prince, who are brothers, meet and compare the misery of their newfound and unobtainable loves ("Agony"). The Baker's Wife, who is eavesdropping, takes note when Rapunzel's prince mentions {{that he is in}} love with a girl in a tower with hair [...] "as yellow as corn." [...] The Baker's Wife fools Rapunzel into letting down her hair by telling her that she is her prince and pulls out a piece of it. Meanwhile, The Mysterious Man gives Milky White back to the Baker.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{destruction}} of Tenochtitlan, the Templo Mayor, {{like most of the}} rest of the city, was taken apart and covered over by the new Spanish colonial city. The Temple’s exact location was forgotten, although by the 20th-century scholars had a good idea where <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> This was based on the archeological work done at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Leopoldo Batres did some excavation work at the end of the 19th century under the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral because at this time, the temple was thought to be there. [...] In the first decades of the 20th century, Manuel Gamio found part of the southwest corner of the temple and his finds were put on public display. However, it did not generate great public interest in excavating further because the zone was an upper-class residential area. [...] In 1933, Emilio Cuevas found part of a staircase and beam. In 1948, Hugo Moedano and Elma Estrada Balmori excavated a platform containing serpent heads and offerings. In 1966, Eduardo Contreras and Jorge Angula excavated a chest containing offerings that was first explored by Gamio.|$|E
