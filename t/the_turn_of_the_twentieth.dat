5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, {{with the emergence of}} the feminist movement at <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is {{regarded as one of the}} founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> {{century the}} church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} 19th century, {{mainstream}} American {{writers such as}} Edith Wharton, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman and F. Marion Crawford all wrote ghost fiction.

5|$|As far as {{documented}} {{evidence is}} concerned, genealogies attest {{that many of}} the predecessors of those living in the communities today originally came from the town of Loon on Bohol’s western coast; Mariano Datahan is reported to have arrived at the site of present-day Biabas at <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century; The Philippine Independent Church in Biabas was established in 1902; Datahan wrote a letter to President Manuel Quezon in 1937; and the resistance hero Col.

A project to document the history of the Eskaya community via the Eskayan language is presently being undertaken at The Australian National University.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York {{consented to}} allow the board of {{trustees}} to authorize the opening of a law school and a medical school. St. John's College officially became Fordham University on March 7, 1907. The name Fordham refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of the Bronx River ("ford by the hamlet"). When Fordham and several other Westchester County towns were consolidated into the Bronx at <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, the village became the borough's Fordham neighborhood. Still in existence today, it is just {{to the west of the}} Rose Hill campus.|$|E
5|$|Real-world {{historical}} {{designs were}} also adapted for the fictional world. Flying battleships of the Anatoray and Disith nations included components of Japanese dreadnoughts in commission at <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers {{were based on}} Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats {{provided the basis for}} Disith uniforms. Another inspiration for creators came from a silent film of the airship Hindenburg, which depicted the aircraft's UFO-like silver-plated design in contrast to the traditional buildings below. This imagery was reproduced in the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{next decade}} {{was marked by}} several rebellions against the new {{political}} order, including naval revolts (1891, 1893–94), the Federalist Rebellion (1893–95), the War of Canudos (1896–97), and the Vaccine Revolt (1904), during which {{the quality of the}} Brazilian Navy severely declined relative to its neighbors thanks to an Argentine–Chilean naval arms race. By <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, an antiquated Brazilian naval fleet with just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel (in 1896) and only two modern armored warships could be faced by Argentine and Chilean navies filled with ships ordered in the last decade.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, FES {{accounted}} for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, {{where it was}} largely used as a medicinal product. Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, selling for double the price of domestic stouts. By 1912, total production had reached 105,000 hogsheads. The American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely {{with the introduction of}} Prohibition. The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was not successful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Herds {{of red and}} {{fallow deer}} also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can {{frequently}} be seen in herds {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, soaring {{demand for}} coffee and rubber brought {{prosperity}} to the Brazilian economy. The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a large naval building program in 1904, which authorized {{the construction of a}} large number of warships, including three battleships. The Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906. While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship Norge and the British (originally Chilean) , the contracted ships were to follow Armstrong Whitworth's Design 439 (Design 188 in Vickers' files). They would displace 11,800longtons (12,000tonnes), have a speed of 19knots (22mph; 35km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9inches (23cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German s.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} eighteenth century, a {{significant}} number of physicians started to attend births. Their prominence in childbirth increased drastically into <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, almost rendering midwives obsolete. However, the increase of physician-attended births coincided with an increase demand of newly arrived European immigrants who have been accustomed to midwifery from their cultures. Moreover, poor women and African Americans, particularly those living in the South, traditionally employed midwives as well. In fact, in the early twentieth century, midwives attended as many as 90 percent of all black births in the southern states. For reasons of culture, language, and cost, midwives did not completely disappear despite the rise in physician-attended births at <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.|$|E
