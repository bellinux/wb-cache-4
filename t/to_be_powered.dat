5|$|Monds Roller Mills {{building}} is a four-level, three-story, bluestone building with an iron gabled roof built c1846 by John Kinder Archer. The mill, and its associated storage and transportation needs, was the main employer in Carrick for many years. It was the last mill in Tasmania <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by water.|$|E
5|$|The AFVG was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> {{by a pair}} of SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley M45G turbofans, {{which were}} to be fed by Mirage-style half-shock cone inlets. The engine {{development}} programme contract was to be issued by the French government to a SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley joint venture company registered in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Ju 87 had begun in 1933 {{as part of the}} Sturzbomber-Programm. The Ju 87 was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by the British Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. Ten engines were ordered by Junkers on 19 April 1934 for £ 20,514, two shillings and sixpence.|$|E

5|$|The H-9 was {{intended}} as a trainer with dual control columns. The airframe was a H-1 variant rebuild. The powerplants consisted of two JumoA-1s or D-1s. The H-10 was also designated to trainer duties. Rebuilt from an H-2 or H-3 airframe, it was installed with full defensive armament including 13mm (.51in) MG 131 and 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z machine guns. It was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by two Jumo 211A-1s, D-1s or F-2s.|$|E
5|$|The HSV W427 will {{be noted}} in TWR / HSV {{history as the}} only car to which Tom Walkinshaw 'personally' {{attached}} his name. It {{was not the first}} Holden Commodore-based vehicle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by a 7.0L LS7 V8 engine as that honour went to the more affordable Corsa Specialised Vehicles GTS.|$|E
5|$|The XF4H-1 was {{designed}} to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided missiles, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45° and was equipped with blown flaps for better low-speed handling.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for his second}} film, Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta), Ismail recalled Djajakusuma to Jakarta. For the film, Djajakusuma helped Ismail adapt the General Assault of 1 March 1949 for the screen. Production was completed on a low budget; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by a car battery. Despite this and other difficulties, Djajakusuma stayed on after the film's completion, completing another work for Perfini, Dosa Tak Berampun (Unforgivable Sin), later that year. Ismail served as director for this film, {{about a man who}} leaves his family after he is transfixed by the smile of a waitress.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{inclined}} planes was an innovation that Green had pioneered elsewhere. He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal, which included six planes, five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism. He {{was at the time}} the engineer for the Grand Western Canal, which included seven vertical boat lifts and an inclined plane at Wellisford, again <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by a descending bucket mechanism. The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks.|$|E
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} the backbone of RAF Fighter Command, and saw action in the European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved {{over the course of}} its service life.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{proposed a}} purpose-built aircraft, but tests indicated {{it would not}} outperform the already-operational 707, so the latter was chosen instead. To increase endurance, this design was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by eight General Electric TF34s. It would carry its radar in a rotating dome mounted {{at the top of}} a forward-swept tail, above the fuselage. Boeing was selected ahead of McDonnell Douglas's DC-8-based proposal in July 1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated EC-137D as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test-beds did not need the same 14-hour endurance demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the Pratt & Whitney JT3D commercial engines, and a later reduction in endurance requirement led to retaining the normal engines in production.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit.|$|E

5|$|The TSR-2 was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} {{variants of}} {{those used in}} the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
5|$|The only {{disagreements}} {{were over}} {{the size and}} range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved {{not to be the}} barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed. The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time {{it was clear that the}} two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus engines, being developed for the TSR-2, allowed either design <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by only four engines.|$|E
5|$|To {{test the}} design, the Do 17S and Do 17U were produced, both <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>powered</b> by the DB 600 power plants. However, {{a call for}} all DB 600 series engines to be {{reserved}} for fighters led to the variants being fitted with Bramo Fafnir 323 A radial engines. The bomb load was increased to 1,000kg (2,200lb) and a fourth crew member was added. It proved to be underpowered, so Bramo 323 P engines were then fitted. Only three Do 17S and 15 Do 17Us were built. With the updates, the Dornier, with a full bomb load, had a combat radius of 322km (200mi). Later variants, in the Do 17 Z-3, Z-4 and Z-5, which were fitted with cameras, dual trainer controls and flotation aids (for maritime operations) respectively, still could not solve the problems with range and bomb load.|$|E
