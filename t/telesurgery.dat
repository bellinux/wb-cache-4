50|$|In {{association}} with the Department of Defense, the Nicholson Center conducts studies to conclude if remote surgery across hospitals is possible through the Internet. The Feasibility of <b>Telesurgery</b> Across Metropolitan Hospital Systems study determines what the lag time is between two locations, then mimics that lag time using simulators and/or video displays to study how a surgeon responds to it. The Nicholson Center researched to determine if <b>telesurgery</b> can be performed based on bandwidth available and whether a surgeon can handle the lag time that is in place. The research team, headed by Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Roger Smith, had successfully tested the lag time to Ft. Worth, Texas, a location more than 1,200 miles away. This research determined that <b>telesurgery</b> is safe and possible in the United States.The <b>telesurgery</b> research benefits the US military by finding the necessary steps to providing specialized healthcare for wounded soldiers in remote locations.

5000|$|On September 7, 2001, he made New York a world {{first in}} <b>TeleSurgery</b> {{operating}} in the gallbladder of a patient who was in Strasbourg. This was the Lindbergh Operation.|$|E
50|$|With the {{application}} of robotic systems, <b>telesurgery</b> was introduced as the surgeon could be at a site {{far removed from the}} patient. The first transatlantic surgery has been called the Lindbergh Operation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{possibility}} of long-distance operations {{depends on the}} patient having access to a da Vinci System, but technically the system could allow a doctor to perform <b>telesurgery</b> on a patient in another country. In 2001, Dr. Marescaux and a team from IRCAD used a combination of high-speed fiber-optic connection with an average delay of 155 ms with advanced asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and a Zeus telemanipulator to successfully perform the first transatlantic surgical procedure, covering the distance between New York and Strasbourg. The event was considered a milestone of global <b>telesurgery,</b> and was dubbed [...] "Operation Lindbergh".|$|E
50|$|The {{surgery was}} the result of a closely coordinated {{partnership}} between IRCAD, the France Télécom group and Computer Motion, the developer of Zeus surgical robotic systems. The EITS (European Institute of <b>Telesurgery)</b> was also involved.|$|E
50|$|Marketed for $975,000, the ZEUS Robot Surgical System {{was less}} {{expensive}} than the da Vinci Surgical System, which cost $1 million. The cost of an operation through <b>telesurgery</b> is not precise but must pay for the surgical system, the surgeon, and contribute to paying for a year’s worth of ATM technology which runs between $100,000-$200,000.|$|E

50|$|Remote {{surgery or}} <b>telesurgery</b> is {{performance}} of surgical procedures where the surgeon is not physically {{in the same}} location as the patient, using a robotic teleoperator system controlled by the surgeon. The remote operator may give tactile feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics and high-speed data connections. A critical limiting factor is the speed, latency and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} a $4.9 million {{grant from the}} Department of Defense and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (United States Army) (TATRC) in 2011, the research focused on the ways telemedicine technology {{can be used in}} surgery for both civilian and military purposes, along with studying other areas of research.

50|$|Surgical robot {{systems have}} been {{developed}} from the first functional <b>telesurgery</b> system-ZEUS-to the da Vinci Surgical System, which is currently the only commercially available surgical robotic system. In Israel a company was established by Professor Moshe Schoham, from the faculty of Mechanical Engeenering at the Technion. Used mainly for “on-site” surgery, these robots assist the surgeon visually, with better precision and less invasiveness to patients. The Da Vinci Surgical System has also been combined to form a Dual Da Vinci system which allows two surgeons {{to work together on}} a patient at the same time. The system gives the surgeons the ability to control different arms, switch command of arms at any point and communicate through headsets during the operation.|$|E

50|$|Remote surgery (also {{known as}} <b>telesurgery)</b> {{is the ability}} for a doctor to perform surgery on a patient {{even though they are}} not {{physically}} in the same location. It is a form of telepresence. A robot surgical system generally consists of one or more arms (controlled by the surgeon), a master controller (console), and a sensory system giving feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics, cutting edge communication technology such as high-speed data connections and elements of management information systems. While the field of robotic surgery is fairly well established, most of these robots are controlled by surgeons at the location of the surgery. Remote surgery is essentially advanced telecommuting for surgeons, where the physical distance between the surgeon and the patient is immaterial. It promises to allow the expertise of specialized surgeons to be available to patients worldwide, without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital.|$|E
50|$|The {{success and}} {{exposure}} of the procedure led the robotic team {{to use the same}} technology within Canada, this time using Bell Canada's public internet between Hamilton, Ontario and North Bay, Ontario (a distance of about 400 kilometers). While operation Lindbergh used the most expensive ATM fiber optics communication to ensure reliability and success of the first <b>telesurgery,</b> the follow on procedures in Canada used standard public internet which was provisioned with QOS using MPLS QOS-MPLS. A series of complex laparoscopic procedures were performed where in this case, the expert clinician would support the surgeon who was less experienced, operating on his patient. This resulted in patient receiving the best care possible while remaining in their hometown, the less experienced surgeon gaining valuable experience, and the expert surgeon providing their expertise without travel. The robotic team's goal was to go from Lindbergh's proof of concept to a real-life solution. This was achieved with over 20 complex laparoscopic operations between Hamilton and North Bay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability to}} carry out {{delicate}} manipulations relies greatly upon feedback. For example, {{it is easy to}} learn how much pressure is required to handle an egg. In robotic surgery, surgeons {{need to be able to}} perceive the amount of force being applied without directly touching the surgical tools. Systems known as force-feedback, or haptic technology, have been developed to simulate this. Haptics is the science of touch. Any type of Haptic feedback provides a responsive force in opposition to the touch of the hand. Haptic technology in <b>telesurgery,</b> making a virtual image of a patient or incision, would allow a surgeon to see what they are working on as well as feel it. This technology is designed to give a surgeon the ability to feel tendons and muscles as if it were actually the patient's body. [...] However these systems are very sensitive to time-delays such as those present in the networks used in remote surgery.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>telesurgery</b> {{robotic system}} that the da Vinci {{was based on}} was developed at SRI International in Menlo Park with grant support from DARPA and NASA. Although the telesurgical robot was originally intended to facilitate remotely performed surgery in battlefield and other remote environments, {{it turned out to}} be more useful for minimally invasive on-site surgery. The patents for the early prototype were sold to Intuitive Surgical in Mountain View, California. The da Vinci senses the surgeon's hand movements and translates them electronically into scaled-down micro-movements to manipulate the tiny proprietary instruments. It also detects and filters out any tremors in the surgeon's hand movements, so that they are not duplicated robotically. The camera used in the system provides a true stereoscopic picture transmitted to a surgeon's console. Examples of using the da Vinci system include the first robotically assisted heart bypass (performed in Germany) in May 1998, and the first performed in the United States in September 1999; and the first all-robotic-assisted kidney transplant, performed in January 2009. The da Vinci Si was released in April 2009, and initially sold for $1.75 million.|$|E

He took a master-class at the “Service de Chirurgie Digestive” of the “Hopital Saint Antoine” in Paris directed by Prof. Roland Parc and at the “Service de Chirurgie Digestive” of the “Clinique Saint Roch” in Montpellier directed by Dr. Guy Costalat.In 1993 he was responsible for a research for the “Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico” [...] in Milan titled “Modello sperimentale nel maiale: rettopessi con rete di mersilene al promontorio per via laparoscopica” [...] and for another research titled “Indicazioni e limiti al trattamento endoscopico nella patologia ano-rettale nei confronti della chirurgia ambulatoriale”.In 1994 he was responsible for a research titled ”Rettopessi per via laparoscopica nel prolasso rettale: trasferimento della metodica sperimentale alla pratica clinica”.Boccasanta actually contributed to the introduction in Italy of the execution of rectopexy and of the resection rectopexy via laparoscopic mini invasive in the rectal prolapse, proved by his surgical interventions, his scientific publications in very important Italian and foreign magazines and proved by his videos shown everywhere successfully. He was the first surgeon in Italy introducing the execution of the “Proctosigmoidectomia per via perineale sec. Altemeier con perineoplastica totale” in ancient patients affected by complete rectal prolapse and in 1997 he won the 1st award for best communication on the “rectal prolapse” topic presented at the 4th National Congress UCP Club in Modena.His résumé in this field was enriched in 1997, when he took his University Diploma at the Faculty of Medicine in Strasbourg (France) in “Laparoscopic visceral surgery”.In the same year he also attended a European master-class in “Laparoscopic colorectal surgery” in Bordeaux (France) and the “Advanced Course in Laparoscopic colorectal Surgery” in Strasbourg at the European Institute of <b>Telesurgery.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} Telemedicine and <b>Telesurgery</b> technologies allow {{patients to}} share medical experts remotely through communication networks. However, network bandwidth, network latency and jitter (variation of latency), are {{the obstacles to}} {{the widespread use of}} this technology remotely. Optical Burst Switching (OBS) networks greatly expand network bandwidth in existing network infrastructure by utilizing multiple DWDM channels within a single fiber, enabling high bandwidth applications. However, the burst assembly process in OBS networks introduces latency and jitter, making it unsuitable for high bandwidth, latency sensitive applications such as <b>telesurgery</b> and telemedicine. In this paper, we propose a content aware burst assembly scheme which dynamically adjusts the burst assembly parameters based on the content being assembled. The proposed content aware burst assembly minimizes the latency and jitter within a video frame, as well as across the left-view and right-view frames for 3 D vision generation.
