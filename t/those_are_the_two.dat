The main type of dividend referring to common stocks is called a stock dividend. Unlike cash dividends, stock dividends do not involve the distribution of cash to the common stock owners. Instead, a stock dividend distributes additional stock of the company to the owners of the company (people that own stocks of the company). Stock dividends have equity. They are even dispersed to the people who own stock depending on their portion of ownership in a corporation. If a corporation is declared a 20% stock dividend then this means the corporation will give out 2 shares for every 10 shares to the shareholders. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> different types of dividends that can be offered to the shareholders of a common stock.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} widely {{accepted}} {{as one of}} the worst threat to the world’s biodiversity. A recently proposed solution to help species survive climate change is “assisted colonisation”, i. e. translocations of species to more suitable sites. Although assisted colonisation could be a powerful conservation tool, translocations are known to have a low success rate despite being commonly-used. Before promoting assisted colonisation as a solution, we need to make two major advances: first, understand how translocated species will respond to a changing climate and if their population viability will be compromised and, second, develop a quantitative framework to improve the success rates of conservation translocation under global environmental change. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> aims of my thesis. The hihi (stitchbird; Notiomystis cincta) was used as a study species. It has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of several translocations {{in the past few decades}} and every translocated population is intensely monitored, yielding long-term demographic datasets. Climate was found to be a key factor in the dynamics of translocated population, and thus viability. However, it may also interact with other intrinsic factors like density and age to influence species’ long-term persistence. A stochastic population model built to quantify the potential impacts of future climate change on translocated populations’ long-term persistence showed the importance of taking into account the impact of longer and more frequent extreme weather on translocated population’s viability. Moreover, MaxEnt was found to be a good habitat suitability model for translocated populations and used to identify future translocation sites for the hihi under climate change. Finally, quantitative guidelines for the planning and implementation of assisted colonisations were developed. They address the known issues impeding translocation success, and, if used, will maximise the success of assisted colonisations. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
