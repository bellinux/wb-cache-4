5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to <b>the</b> <b>Class</b> II dollar, except lettering {{similar to that}} on <b>the</b> <b>Class</b> I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of <b>the</b> <b>Class</b> III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as <b>the</b> <b>Class</b> II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine.

50|$|There {{are usually}} four social classes that are {{described}} in America: <b>the</b> upper <b>class,</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>class,</b> <b>the</b> working <b>class,</b> and <b>the</b> lower <b>class.</b> <b>The</b> upper <b>class</b> typically earns above $250,000 per year; <b>the</b> middle <b>class</b> earns between $48,000 and $249,000 per year; <b>the</b> working <b>class</b> up to $48,000; and <b>the</b> lower <b>class</b> up generally receives a minimal income that {{is not enough to}} sustain themselves.

Results also show that participants perceived the relations between <b>the</b> middle <b>class</b> and <b>the</b> working <b>class</b> to be more permeable and less legitimate than the relations between <b>the</b> middle <b>class</b> and <b>the</b> upper <b>class.</b> Thus, results indicate that <b>the</b> middle <b>class</b> participants found themselves to be more similar to, and less distinct from, <b>the</b> working <b>class</b> in comparison to <b>the</b> upper <b>class...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with <b>the</b> <b>class</b> of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and <b>the</b> <b>class</b> of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that <b>the</b> <b>class</b> of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and <b>the</b> <b>class</b> of all sets. This correspondence well-orders <b>the</b> <b>class</b> of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
