I think that's a good way to deal with it, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, and I think that would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{kinds of}} women's groups {{all over the}} country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed. For example, a {{question}} of equality before the law; we are interested in the equal rights amendment. The question of child care centers which are totally inadequate in the society, and which women require, {{if they are going to}} assume their rightful position in terms of helping in decisions of the society. The question of a women's right to control her own reproductive processes, that is, laws prohibiting abortion in the state or putting them into criminal statutes; I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> statute that we would [...] addressing ourselves to.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the lead single, [...] "Russian Roulette", Harmony was aware of the mixed {{reaction}} from fans who had heard the track. He assured fans that the song was not fully representative {{to the rest of the}} album, though it reflected Rihanna's growth as an artist. In an interview with Rap-Up, Tricky Stewart announced that he had collaborated with The-Dream on the project. He described the album as a whole as [...] "uptempo and edgy", stating that the album is different from her past works. In February 2010, Rihanna expressed a positive opinion on the album, but commented that her future work would be less intense. She asserted, [...] "I really like the bottom, the grime of it. But if I were to combine that with more energetic, up-tempo pop records, then I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> happy marriage. And that's where we'll probably go next". When asked what the most important song to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] were cited as her favorites.|$|E
5000|$|Gross: [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good {{if there}} really was such a science?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I believe,” said Mildred slowly, as if {{summoning}} her courage, “I {{will speak}} to him myself. Don’t you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> charming. I {{hope you}} will be settled at Dulwich long before I come back from my next cruise.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've a great mind {{to write}} a letter, too," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I'll write to my mother. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good plan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Violet {{looked away}} from him. [...] "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little hard on them? Is it very {{easy for you to}} go away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, uncle," [...] Bob said, suppressing his {{impulse to}} give a shout of satisfaction, and looking as grave as possible. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very nice arrangement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{your very}} best course to pursue, unless you find {{everything}} turn out {{just as you}} would wish, Mr. Repton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, comrade. I {{have heard}} women {{teaching}} their babies to talk, but I should hardly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the way with}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> about it. They {{are long}} odds, {{but not too}} long, I think, Mr. Lyons. At any rate, we will try.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Bowen! And you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{mitigating}} circumstance in his acceptance {{of money from}} her? If he had {{the spirit of a}} man at all, it would make it all the more revolting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell you, Brice," [...] she said, {{the first}} thing, [...] "you must have {{it that they}} have been engaged, and you can call the play 'The Second Chapter,' or {{something}} more alliterative. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great pity," [...] said Margaret. [...] "If {{you were}} {{to give up the}} verse-making, and the trying to do as much as Norman, and fix some time in the day--half an hour, perhaps--for your Greek, I think it might do very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> right," [...] said Tom. [...] "We {{might be}} willing, but we can't assist a {{criminal}} to escape--that's {{a crime in}} itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mrs. Greystock had a plan. [...] "Oh, mamma," [...] said Ellinor, {{when the}} plan was {{proposed}} to her, [...] "do not you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> cruel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She gave {{a kind of}} gasp of astonishment. [...] "Do {{you really}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> right?" [...] She edged a little away from Dr. Morrell, as if with distrust.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{very good}} plan, Captain Dave, though I wish {{that it could}} have been done without Tom Frost being taken. He is a timid sort of boy, and I have no doubt that he has been entirely under the thumb of Robert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good plan, if {{you like}} these people. It would be far better than living by yourself. However, of course I shall pay for your board, and I shall leave money with you; so that, {{if you are not}} {{comfortable}} there, you can do as I said, take a room here.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{very good}} plan,' Mr. Singleton put in. 'I own I am getting rather {{tired of this}} valley. It is all very well for you young people who can climb about among the hills, but I think I know the {{exterior}} of every house in the place, and have made the acquaintance of almost every man, woman, and child in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--all you young fellows <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{equal to}} calling yourselves tailors at once--But {{have you had}} experience? for, crede experto, a horse in a passion is no joker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the best}} way," [...] Vincent said. [...] "We shall {{be able to}} see the county map, too, and to learn all the {{geography}} of the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} but <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> do very well. You might alter it a little; call him Mosette, if you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any better for a bird's name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{very good}} plan, Dias. You {{start in the}} morning, and we will stay quietly here till you {{come back with the}} news. If many brigands are in the pass they might get to hear of us from someone going over from this side, and take it into their heads to come down. I would {{certainly}} rather not have to fight with you away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Tom-- but, somehow, I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wise move to make. Father did {{not trust}} them. He said they were sharpers. If we sent them any word it might put them more on guard than they would {{otherwise}} be. I think {{the best thing to}} do is to go to New York and interview them personally-- if we don't get word from dad before we leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good plan," [...] Jeanne said; [...] "because {{they might}} not stop to pick us up, and then {{we might have a}} long way to reach the shore. No, I think it will be better to stay on board, Harry; for, as you say, if she does have to run away for a time, she is sure to come back again to unload her cargo. But of course do {{whatever}} you think best." ...|$|E
5000|$|Той щял да ме набие. (Bulgarian, {{doubtful}} future: He {{is going}} to beat me up, but I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible because I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I am stronger than him) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} my opinion," [...] I replied, trying to speak slowly, [...] "it is that Mr. Farrar ought to get ten {{thousand}} dollars. And I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> only a moderate reward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Cecily timidly, [...] "that {{will leave}} out Peter and the Story Girl and Sara Ray, {{just as if}} they didn't have a share in it. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us go to {{the theatre}} to-night," [...] said Lord Henry. [...] "There {{is sure to be}} {{something}} on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White's, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rather nice excuse: it would have all the surprise of candour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{very good}} plan, Zaki. We should {{find it very}} {{difficult}} to explain who we were, if we met any Dervishes at Abu Klea. I will have a look at my sketch map; we have found it very good and accurate, so far; and with that, and the compass the General gave me before starting, we ought to have no difficulty in striking the river, as the direction is only a little to the east of south." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{very good}} plan," [...] the captain said, [...] "for {{if you were}} to start with them it is clear that you would only be able to go under half sail. It is evident by your account that you are faster than the frigate, but with a {{reaching}} wind I suppose there is not more than a knot between you, and if the wind freshens you would find it hard to keep up with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the wisest}} plan," [...] the general said. [...] "You will, of course, remain at Delhi till {{reinforcements}} arrive there. The despatches {{will be ready}} for you, in an hour's time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the best}} plan,' Mr. Hawtrey said. 'I hope {{you agree with}} me, Dorothy. I own that the {{prospect}} of a trial terrifies me, and I would do anything to avoid it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Justly judged! I {{shall have}} enough of him by and by, if I take him out to Canada. Once I used to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deliverance; now it has become nothing but a {{gigantic}} trouble!' ...|$|R
