5|$|The tree {{of heaven}} is a very rapidly growing tree, {{possibly}} the fastest growing tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per year for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Dooley {{was invented}} by Dunne to replace a similar {{character}} whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.|$|E

5|$|The Norfolk and Western Railway {{was one of}} {{the twenty}} railroads which joined Amtrak in 1971 but in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> hosted no {{passenger}} service over its route, the centerpiece of which was its main line between Norfolk and Cincinnati which passed through the state of West Virginia.

Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E

5|$|Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was {{established}} in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 percent each by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater. A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK6 million, while the sales price of the lot was estimated at NOK30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam rented the venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> being covered by the municipality. Of the NOK20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation {{to build a new}} athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed, and NOK5 million was debt.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of}} his work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do anything but read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

5|$|The Ashes {{series was}} the only one of seven series that Australia failed to win since Davidson became the team's {{frontline}} strike bowler in 1957–58. Of the 33 Tests in this period, Australia won 16, lost four, drew 12 and tied one. Davidson missed one of the drawn games through injury and broke down mid-match in another two. In the five years that he and Benaud led Australia's bowling attack, the pair totalled 333 wickets; Davidson 170 at 19.25 and Benaud 163 at 25, and were a major part in Australia's return to the forefront of world cricket. This came after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of Davidson's career saw Australia win none and lose seven matches out of twelve. Often bowling in tandem, Davidson's accuracy also forced opposition batsmen to attack Benaud, leading them to perish from the pressure to raise the run rate. In the four years after Davidson retired, Australia struggled without his wicket-taking ability. Only one of the six series was won and two were lost; in all Australia managed six wins and eight losses in 30 Tests. Davidson was at his best when Australia was on her knees; In the four Test losses during the last five years of his career, he took 32 wickets at an average of just 13.9 including a ten wicket haul. In the Tied Test, he took eleven wickets, the other ten wicket haul in his Test career.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of Henry's reign Gerard {{was one of}} the king's chief advisors, {{along with}} Robert of Meulan, Count of Meulan in Normandy and later Earl of Leicester. Gerard was one of Henry's {{greatest}} supporters among the bishops during the Investiture Crisis. In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between Henry and Robert, the Count of Flanders, which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between Henry and his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between Henry and King Philip I of France. After Gerard's return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham. In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused. From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join Bohemond of Antioch, who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure. In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did. At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.|$|E
