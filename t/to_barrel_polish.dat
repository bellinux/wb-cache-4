40|$|Centrifugal <b>Barrel</b> <b>Polishing</b> (CBP) {{was applied}} to L-band niobium {{cavities}} (two types: a single cell cavity and a 3 -cell cavity). With the CBP, polishing speed of the inner surface of the cavity was improved to 10 times that of usual <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing.</b> High gradient performance was measured on the single cell cavity and an electric field gradient of 26. 3 MV/m was reached, which shows much improvement over the best result obtained before. Niobium samples (2. 5 (w), 2. 5 (h), 147 (l) mm) were set in the 3 -cell cavity during the centrifugal <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing</b> for 8 hours.

40|$|Stem {{modularity}} {{in total}} hip replacement introduces an additional taper joint between Ti- 6 Al- 4 V stem components {{with the potential}} for fretting corrosion processes. One possible way to reduce the susceptibility of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V / Ti- 6 Al- 4 V interface to fretting is the surface modification of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. Among the tested, industrially available surface treatments, a combination of two deep anodic spark deposition treatments followed by <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing</b> resulted in a four times lower material release with respect to untreated, machined fretting pad surfaces. The fretting release has been quantified by means of radiotracers introduced in the alloy surface by proton irradiation. In a simple sphere on flat geometry, the semispherical fretting pads were pressed against flat, dog-bone shaped Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fatigue samples cyclically loaded at 4 Hz. In this way a cyclic displacement amplitude along the surfaces of 20 μm has been achieved. A further simplification consisted in the use of deionized water as lubricant. A comparison of the radiotracer results with an electrochemical material characterization after selected treatments by potentiostatic tests of modular stems in 0. 9 % NaCl at 40 °C for ten days confirmed the benefit of deep anodic spark deposition and subsequent <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing</b> for improving the fretting behaviour of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} high temperature treatments followed by only high-pressure water rinse (HPR) of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium cavities. The objective {{is to provide a}} cost effective alternative to the typical cavity processing sequence, by eliminating the material removal step post furnace treatment while preserving or improving the RF performance. The studies have been conducted in the temperature range 800 - 1000 C for different conditions of the starting substrate: large grain and fine grain, electro-polished (EP) and centrifugal <b>barrel</b> <b>polished</b> (CBP) <b>to</b> mirror finish. An interesting effect of the grain size on the performances is found. Cavity results and samples characterization show that furnace contaminants cause poor cavity performance, and a practical solution is found to prevent surface contamination. Extraordinary values of residual resistances ~ 1 nOhm and below are then consistently achieved for the contamination-free cavities. These results lead to a more cost-effective processing and improved RF performance, and, in conjunction with CBP, open a potential pathway to acid-free processing...|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal <b>barrel</b> <b>polishing</b> (CBP) is {{becoming}} acommon R&D tool for SRF cavity preparation aroundthe world. During the CBP process a cylindricallysymmetric SRF cavity {{is filled with}} relatively cheap andenvironmentally friendly abrasive and sealed. The cavityis then spun around a cylindrically symmetric axis athigh speeds uniformly conditioning the inner surface. This uniformity is especially relevant for SRF applicationbecause many times a single manufacturing defect limitsa cavity’s performance well below it’s theoretical limit. In addition CBP has created surfaces with roughness’s onthe order of 10 ’s of nm, which create a unique surfacefor wet chemistry or thin film deposition. CBP is nowbeing utilized at Jefferson Lab, Fermi Lab and CornellUniversity in the US, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotronin Germany, Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro in Italy,and Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology inIndia.
