5|$|While {{relying on}} a script each week, the {{producers}} decided at the outset to allow the cast leeway in what they said and did on the show. Their decisions could affect the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene. If the actors felt that something was untrue to their character or a mode of delivery didn't work, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> to change it, provided they still hit the vital plot points.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free.</b> In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, {{which have the}} same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and {{the band}} were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys {{initially}} refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that the Allman Brothers would be closing the show, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> to leave if they disagreed. The Allman Brothers' performance was used for additional tracks when an expanded version of At Fillmore East, The Fillmore Concerts, was reissued on CD.|$|E

5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, {{they are free to}} move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{also called}} for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal, terminating all commuter train services on the lines. For the service to Oppdal, NSB had an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about {{twice the number of}} passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> to do so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services, so they could continue the service to Oppdal, but this was rejected by the ministry.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the {{inconclusive}} skirmish at Largs, terms of peace were finally agreed upon between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland. On 2 July 1266, with {{the conclusion of the}} Treaty of Perth, the centuries-old territorial dispute over Scotland's western seaboard was at last settled. Within the treaty, Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1280) ceded the Hebrides and Mann to Alexander, who in turn agreed to pay 4,000 merks sterling over four years, and in addition to pay 100 merks sterling in perpetuity. Other conditions stipulated that the inhabitants of the islands would be subject to laws of Scotland; that they were not to be punished for their actions previous to the treaty; and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> to remain or leave their possessions peacefully. In 1266, the Chronicle of Lanercost records that Alexander ruled Mann through appointed bailiffs; Scottish exchequer accounts record that the Sheriff of Dumfries was given allowance for maintaining seven Manx hostages.|$|E

5|$|On 10 June 2011, Chopra penned {{a three-year}} deal with Ipswich Town signing for an {{undisclosed}} fee, which was reported by East Anglian Daily Times to be £1.5 million. Manager Paul Jewell revealed {{that he was the}} type of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra said that he was hungry for goals. He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.|$|E

25|$|On the Norwegian side, the Sami were {{converted}} by {{force to the}} Lutheran faith around 1720. Thomas von Westen was the leading man of the missionary effort, and his methods included the burning of shamanic drums. However, economically the Sami were not that badly off, compared to the Norwegian population. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> to trade with whom they wanted, and entertained trade links with Norwegians and Russians alike. However, the crumbling economy of the Norwegian communities along the outer coast led to increased pressure on the land and conflicts between the two communities.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 1927, Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any {{wrongdoing}} because of Leonard's refusal to appear at the hearings. Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker {{to return to their}} original teams, but each team let them know that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> agents and could sign with any club they wanted. Speaker signed with the Washington Senators for 1927, and Cobb with the Philadelphia Athletics. Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season. Cobb said he had come back only to seek vindication and say he left baseball on his own terms.|$|E

25|$|On {{arrival at}} Grosse Isle, {{emigrant}} ships were {{not permitted to}} sail onwards unless they had assured the authorities that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> of disease. Those with fever cases on board were required to fly a blue flag. Dr. George Douglas, Grosse Isle's chief medical officer, recorded that by mid-summer the quarantine regulations in force were 'physically impossible' to carry out, making it necessary for the emigrants to stay on board their ships for many days. Douglas believed that washing and airing out the ships {{would be enough to}} stop the contagion spreading between infected passengers.|$|E

Captain Herbert told the men {{that they were still}} under naval authority, and that all needed to work together to save themselves. A camp was established on the island, using sailcloth for tents to shelter men and supplies. On 18 January, the ship's longboat, with nine men, sailed for New Providence in the Bahamas to seek help for the stranded crew. The voyage was expected to be short, as the officers still believed they had wrecked on the Reques Keys, in the Bahamas.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was inundated with requests {{to set up}} new television stations. Worrying about congestion of {{the limited number of}} channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new UHF bands for television broadcast. At the time, black and white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> to pick an incompatible system and allow the older VHF channels to die off over time.|$|E
