40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the interplay between}} screen time, sleep duration, outdoor play, having a television in the bedroom {{and the number of}} <b>televisions</b> <b>at</b> home and their association with body mass index (BMI) in preschool children. All participants, 3 - 4 years of age (n[*]=[*] 759), were part of the Groningen expert center for kids with obesity (GECKO) Drenthe birth cohort. Weight and height were measured. Total screen time, number of <b>televisions</b> <b>at</b> home, a <b>television</b> in the bedroom, sleep duration and time of outdoor play were self-reported by parents in a questionnaire. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression-based path analysis was used to estimate direct and indirect effects on BMI in mediation models. A television in the bedroom or more <b>televisions</b> <b>at</b> home gave a higher screen time, which were associated with decreased sleep duration and resulted in higher BMI (indirect effect[*]=[*] 0. 0115, 95 % bootstrap interval[*]=[*] 0. 0016; 0. 0368 and indirect effect[*]=[*] 0. 0026, 95 % bootstrap interval[*]=[*] 0. 0004; 0. 0078, respectively).
