500|$|Stead finds <b>that</b> <b>kids</b> {{today are}} much less {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store.

Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>kids</b> now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E

500|$|Lucas {{was dismayed}} when he {{returned}} to America in June 1971 and read Walter's script, which was written in the style and tone of an exploitation film, similar to 1967's Hot Rods to Hell.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to define kidding intervals and identify causes for long kidding intervals in communal area flocks. Two flocks were selected in the north-eastern part of Zimbabwe and were monitored over two years. Flock entries and exits were recorded, body-mass changes measured fortnightly and blood samples collected in five consecutive weekly intervals in August-September 1988 and March-April 1989. The average kidding interval for does <b>that</b> <b>kidded</b> in August-December (382 ± 90 days) was longer (P< 0. 01) than that for does <b>that</b> <b>kidded</b> in March-April (265 ± 48 days). The overall average kidding interval was 370 ± 122 days. Serum progesterone levels also indicated that of the 26 goats <b>that</b> <b>kidded</b> in October-December 1988, 65 % were non-pregnant 5 - 6 months after kidding. It is suggested that nutritional stress could be the cause of these long kidding intervals...|$|R
