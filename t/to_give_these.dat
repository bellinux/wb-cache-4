5|$|A First Deputy Premier {{was usually}} given {{responsibility}} over one specific area. For example, Kirill Mazurov {{was responsible for}} industry, and Dmitry Polyansky was agriculture. However, after Polyansky's departure in 1973 Mazurov was left the sole First Deputy Premier until Tikhonov was appointed in 1976. An officeholder could also be responsible for coordinating the activities of ministries and state committees and other subordinate bodies of the Council of Ministers. To do this the First Deputy Premier had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> bodies guidance in an expeditious manner to ensure the implementation of plans for {{economic and social development}} and to check if the orders and decisions of the Council of Ministers were being followed. If the Premier could not perform his duties one of the First Deputy Premiers would take on the role of acting Premier until the Premier's return. During the late 1970s, when the health of Premier Alexei Kosygin deteriorated, Nikolai Tikhonov, the First Deputy Premier, acted on his behalf during his absence. When Tikhonov took command of the Soviet economy, Kosygin served in a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex is a mad {{scientist}} who captures Coco and Aku Aku {{and wants to}} use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. Uka Uka, who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after tiring of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, Nina Cortex. Aiding the Cortexes are Doctor N. Gin, who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. Dingodile, another minion of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of Crash of the Titans as a boss character. Aiding the villains {{are a number of}} small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua-like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. Radical Entertainment sought <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> minor characters personalities by giving them a large number of distinctive quotations.|$|E

25|$|The {{founding}} {{convention of}} the Building Trades Department was held in Washington, D.C., on February 10, 1908. Representatives from 19 building trades attended. Breaking with SBTA policy, the delegates agreed to include specialty unions (such as the Slate Roofers, the Composite Roofers, the Soft Stone Cutters and Granite Cutters). The delegates also agreed to a proportional representation scheme, with each union getting one delegate for every 4,000 members. Delegates also agreed to formally push {{for the creation of}} state and local building trades councils, although they refused <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> bodies a vote at department conventions. Finally, delegates approved a governance structure composed of a president, secretary-treasurer and six directors. Kirby was elected president, and Spencer secretary-treasurer.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Welsh clubs {{play in the}} English league system. Prior to 1996, these clubs, {{as members of the}} Football Association of Wales, were {{entitled}} to enter the Welsh Cup, and thus eligible to take the European place that came with winning the competition. However, from 1996 onwards, these clubs were prevented from taking part, which meant that they would {{no longer be able to}} claim a European place representing Wales. However, these clubs remained as members of the FAW, meaning that it was unclear whether they would be eligible to claim one of England's European places in the event that they met the qualifying criteria. This was not a major issue as for many years the Welsh clubs were in the lower divisions of the Football League and tended not to make the latter stages of either the FA or League Cups. However, in 2008, Cardiff City reached the final of the FA Cup, which led to UEFA and the Football Association needing to reach a consensus on the club being one of England's representatives in the event of them winning the competition (this became moot as they lost the 2008 FA Cup Final). However, the question of participation in European competition was only definitively resolved in 2012, when Cardiff reached another major final (this time the League Cup Final, which they again lost). UEFA stated that there would be no bar to Cardiff City or Swansea City being eligible for one of England's places; at the same time however they prevented the FAW from offering the European place for winning the Welsh Cup to teams playing in the English league system (the FAW had invited the six clubs playing in England to participate in the 2011–12 Welsh Cup, and had hoped to persuade UEFA to allow them <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> clubs the right to claim the European place). In 2013, Swansea became the first Welsh club to gain a place representing England by winning the League Cup and qualifying for the 2013–14 Europa League.|$|E

500|$|The {{last of the}} {{original}} 47/4 conversions, from 47650 to 47665, were fitted with extra fuel tanks, giving them an extended range. Four earlier Class 47/4s were also converted. In 1989 it was decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> locomotives easy recognisability, and so these locomotives were renumbered into their own series from 47801 to 47820. At the same time, further locomotives were fitted with extra fuel tanks and renumbered; the series eventually reached 47854. After the privatisation of British Rail, the locomotives in the 47/8 number range were mainly used by Virgin CrossCountry on cross-country work until the introduction of their Voyager trains. These duties have kept them maintained in serviceable condition, allowing them to remain operational longer than {{the majority of their}} classmates. As a consequence most of them [...] received relatively recent overhauls. The locomotives in this number range are officially Class 47/4s under the TOPS system.|$|E
500|$|Gleeson was an {{advisor to}} men {{of all faiths}} in the {{regiment}} and kept careful records of their names and addresses {{so that he could}} write to the families of those that died. He ended each letter with the words [...] "They paid a great sacrifice", which was later used as the title of a book published in 2010 that details the wartime service records of men from Cork. [...] Much of his time was spent answering letters from families in Ireland concerned about the wellbeing of their sons and husbands. [...] At times the task almost overwhelmed him and this is evident in his personal diary when he wrote, in June 1915, [...] "I got 12 letters today; just after reading them. What answering they will take tomorrow. I like <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> poor people all the solace I can, anyhow, but still there’s no limit to the sorrowing inquiries.

500|$|Plans {{to begin}} {{construction}} {{were placed on}} hold in 1917. Large numbers of anti-submarine warfare vessels and merchant ships were needed to ensure the safe passage of men and materiel to Europe during Germany's U-boat campaign and were given top priority. This opened {{the opportunity for a}} massive redesign, the need for which had become apparent in light of experience gained in the Battle of Jutland, fought shortly after the initial design for the Lexingtons had been approved and in which three British battlecruisers had been lost. The fact that the U.S. Navy misunderstood the essential points of the battle initially was shown by its ignoring the Lexingtons staying power while increasing their main armament to eight 16"/50 caliber guns and their secondary armament to fourteen 6"/53 caliber guns. Other factors for this decision were the discovery of plans by Britain and Japan for new battlecruisers armed with 15- and 16-inch guns (respectively) and the recommendation of the Bureau of Ordnance <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> ships the ability [...] "to inflict fatal damage on the enemy's most powerful vessels at a distance no less than that at which she can be reached by the heavy gunfire of these opponent battleships." [...] Only 20 of a newer style of boiler were needed, few enough to fit below the armored deck, and the number of funnels was reduced to five. The armor scheme was not modified, as that would have compromised the longitudinal strength of the hull.|$|E

The band's vocalist and songwriter Ichiro Yamaguchi felt a new resolution to create music that would resonate with a general pop music audience, who listened to idol acts such as Girls' Generation and AKB48. As rock music was no longer a popular staple during the early 2010s in Japan, Yamaguchi felt that the reasons people listened to music had changed over time, and wanted to mix rock music with entertainment-focused music in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> people the type of music that they look for.|$|E

[...] It thus excluded the SPLA strongholds in Abyei, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, known collectively during the talks as the Three Areas. [...] The SPLA negotiators then spent several years attempting <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>these</b> regions the right to a referendum in which they could decide if they want to be under the administrative control of the north or south. [...] This would potentially mean that these regions would become part of a nation of South Sudan after the 2011 independence referendum.

2500|$|The {{inclusion}} {{of human rights}} into development discourse has also brought along a certain language of rights.
