Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who {{inserted the}} first slug, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production.

30|$|Therefore, {{considering}} the diverse opportunities, two efficiencies were defined {{for the proposed}} system {{considering the}} performance of both <b>the</b> <b>reactors,</b> <b>the</b> preheating requirements of the solids and gas reactants in both <b>the</b> <b>reactors,</b> {{as well as the}} heat recuperated from solid. The first efficiency takes into account the syngas produced in both <b>the</b> <b>reactors,</b> while <b>the</b> second efficiency is defined considering only the syngas from the splitting of CO 2 and H 2 O in <b>the</b> oxidation <b>reactor.</b>|$|R
30|$|Two {{reactors}} with {{a working}} volume of 2.0  L, wrapped {{with aluminum foil}} paper, were set up to run the N-damo process. And 1.5  L of the abovementioned homogeneous slurry was filled into <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> and mixed by stirring.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> was {{powered up}} successfully, {{but after a}} few hours the power level dropped and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> started.|$|E
5|$|A {{team from}} Argonne {{was on hand}} for {{powering}} up the first reactor at the Hanford Site, where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs. They watched <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> in shifts, with John Marshall {{and others on the}} day shift, Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift, ending at midnight, and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift. While the Marshalls were babysitting <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the removal}} of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> in October 2008, the {{university}} proposed demolishing the structure and redeveloping the site for other uses. The plan was stopped after <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> building {{was placed on the}} Washington Heritage Register, the state's list of historic buildings, a designation that was contested by the University of Washington. Preservationists suggested re-using the building as a museum dedicated to the state's nuclear history and continuing research. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, based on an application from UW architecture student Abby Inpanbutr (then Abby Martin) submitted in spring 2008.|$|E
5|$|The design used a {{thin layer}} of {{aluminum}} to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> and drop out the other side into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|To {{continue}} the research {{where it would}} not pose a public health hazard, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was disassembled {{and moved to the}} Argonne Woods site. There Fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions, revelling in the opportunities provided by the reactor's abundant production of free neutrons. The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> for biological and medical research. Initially, Argonne was run by Fermi as part of the University of Chicago, but it became a separate entity with Fermi as its director in May 1944.|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{the extraction of}} alumina from calcined kaolin by leaching with boiling RCI in a train of three 50 -gal continuous, stirred reactors.

This report describes modifications to <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> and to <b>the</b> operations that led to decreased fines generation and improved solid-liquid separation. Modifications to <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> included custom-made impellers, {{the addition of a}} baffle system, a subsurface slurry discharge system, and slower rotation of the impellers.

5|$|Wigner was {{disappointed}} that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it {{by the head of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem. Without the additional tubes, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> at full power; but this would have set the project back a year. During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site. Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E
5|$|DuPont {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product.

It operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses.
