5|$|Historically {{the role}} of French rugby coach (or trainer) has varied considerably.

Therefore, a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible.|$|E

The Voorhis family relocated to Winnetka, Illinois, near the League's Chicago headquarters. The League, which included both consumer and producer cooperatives, had fallen on hard times in the postwar period. Under his leadership, the League's financial position gradually improved and some major cooperatives that had remained aloof from the League were persuaded to join. The League expanded its purview, founding the Group Health Association of America and the National Association of Housing Cooperatives.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E

LeRoy Pope Walker of Alabama was made Secretary of War, after being recommended for this post by Clement Clay and William Yancey (both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves). John Reagan of Texas became Postmaster General. Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana became Attorney General. Although Stephen Mallory was not put forward by the delegation from his state of Florida, Davis insisted {{that he was the}} best man for <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{utilized}} his existing {{position and}} his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position.

Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.|$|E

On 1September, however, with HB1001 partially complete, Lockheed machinists went on a four-month strike.

5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid for <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, {{one of the first}} magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> the police to enforce the laws, {{even if they did}} not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E

5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E
5|$|East Midwood {{held its}} first annual meeting on November 18, 1924 at the Jewish Communal Center of Flatbush (also known as the Flatbush Jewish Center), and there elected its first president, Pincus Weinberg.

5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began.

Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
