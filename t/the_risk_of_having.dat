He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore less important than <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{two hours}} after the court made its initial {{judgment}} in favour of van der Garde, the FIA published an entry list for the Australian Grand Prix that included both Nasr and Ericsson for Sauber following pre-event scrutineering. Despite this, neither driver took to the circuit during the first practice session on the Friday due to Sauber running <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> team assets seized for not complying with court orders. Nevertheless, based on media speculation about Bernie Ecclestone's intervention to avoid further negative publicity on the sport, Ericsson and Nasr did participate in that afternoon's second practice session. On Saturday, 14 March 2015, the dispute reached a temporary resolution thanks to van der Garde announcing that he would forego racing in Melbourne, {{with a view to}} finding a more permanent solution in the future. The Sauber team and its new drivers for 2015 were thus able to complete Saturday's qualifying session and a point-scoring race on the Sunday.|$|E

40|$|SETTING: Arusha, Tanzania. OBJECTIVE: To assess {{risk factors}} that might {{influence}} TB {{control in the}} general population and in livestock-keepers. METHODS: Of 242 villages in four districts, 27 were selected randomly. In each village, a general and a livestock-keeping group were selected at random. The households were home-visited and 426 family members were interviewed. RESULTS: On average, three-quarters of households practised at least one risk activity for transmission of zoonotic tuberculosis, and respondents had poor knowledge about tuberculosis. In the livestock-keeping group, <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a tuberculosis patient in the family were determined by poor ventilation (OR 2. 6, 95 %CI 1. 1 – 6. 5), confining livestock indoors with people (OR 2. 3, 95 %CI 1. 1 – 5. 0) and multiple determinants including poor ventilation (OR 13. 5, 95 %CI 2. 5 – 71. 7). <b>Risk</b> activities and <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a tuberculosis patient in a family were significantly higher in the livestock-keeping group.

40|$|One of {{the most}} radical ways of {{teaching}} about universal human rights and international humanitarian law would be to teach about these fundamental internationally-recognized standards for humane interpersonal conduct to every child who enters school in the United States.   American illiteracy about human rights and humanitarian law standards contributes to the climate in which the United States preaches human rights to it's perceived opponents while refusing to apply universally recognized hr and ihl principles to itself. From the failure to incorporate into the American educational structure the cultural and linguistic rights of Indigenous peoples and ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities to the refusal {{to submit to the}} same standards of international humanitarian law which apply to all combatants, U.

25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult.

Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E

This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable.

25|$|While {{the backs}} prepare {{to receive a}} kick, the other {{defenders}} will attempt to apply pressure to the kicker. It is usually rather predictable when a side is about to kick: normally {{one member of the}} attacking team is in charge of kicking, and as the team prepares to kick, he will drop back and make himself available deep behind the dummy half, to give himself space and time to set up for the kick. To limit the kicker's effectiveness, the defenders will often rush up out of the defensive line towards him. As well as giving him less time to set up, this action can cloud the kicker's mind, distracting him with thoughts of the upcoming tackle or encouraging him to consider switching to another attacking option due to the sudden change in the defensive line. This combination of physical and mental pressure may lead to a poor kick, giving an advantage to the non-kicking team. This manoeuvre could also result in a 'charge-down', if a defending player manages {{to get in the way}} of the ball very shortly after it is kicked (If the ball travels forward this is an exception to the knock-on rule). This often results in a line break or try to the previously defending team, however it runs <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the attacking team regather the ball for a new set of tackles.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 70s the Mary Rose Committee {{collaborated with}} museum representatives, diving clubs and archaeologists to {{campaign}} for legal protection of shipwrecks as vital to the national historical heritage. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 stipulated that any wreck that was unclaimed and was salvaged had {{to be sold to}} pay for the expenses of the salvers. This meant that any shipwreck old enough to fall under the sway of the Act was threatened by commercial exploitation. Instead of being carefully excavated and recorded by maritime archaeologists, historically invaluable wrecks risked being destroyed by unscrupulous salvers and treasure hunters. The joint organisation Committee for Nautical Archaeology, of which the Mary Rose Committee was a member, successfully lobbied to grant the wreck legal protection under the Protection of Wrecks Act of 1973, with the Mary Rose being among the first to receive legal protection. However, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> salvaged artefacts confiscated was still a very real risk under UK salvage law, and a confrontation had to be averted by continuous negotiations with the Receiver of Wreck, a division of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The Mary Rose, along with a few other historic wrecks, was a vital example during the lobbying for the new shipping act as well as the gradual change in implementation of UK salvage law.|$|E

500|$|Catiline {{was once}} again a {{candidate}} for the consulship for the year of 62 BC. As part of his campaign, Catiline promised reforms to reduce and cancel debts, a proposal which brought him the support of bankrupt aristocrats, debtors, and poor farmers whose agricultural ventures had failed. This proposal, however, also pitched the conservatives, moderates and members of the Senate against him. On the day of the elections, Cicero attended wearing a breastplate under his tunic in an attempt to raise the alarm in the Senate and provoke the fear that Catiline might resort to violence as consul. In the end, Lucius Licinius Murena and Decimus Junius Silanus were elected to the position of consul and Catiline's bid for the position had once again failed. In response, and having lost hope of having a successful political career, Catiline began to conspire against the Senate. Cicero employed spies to keep tabs on Catiline and began to piece together a case against Catiline to be brought to the Senate. In the midst of these developments, Hybrida first tried to remain on the fence, but, was forced to action in the face of <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> himself charged as a co-conspirator. On 6 November 63 BC, Cicero learned of a plot to have himself {{and other members of the}} Senate assassinated and Rome set on fire and sacked. While all of this was happening, Catiline and an army of his supporters, under the command of Gaius Manlius, were to march on Rome in response to this attack and bring Rome to its salvation. This did not happen, and Cicero called a meeting of the Senate which Catiline himself attended. At this meeting, Cicero launched an attack against Catiline denouncing him [...] "to his face" [...] while providing the details of the plot that he had learned of the night before. After this meeting, Catiline fled the city of Rome to join up with Manlius and an army of approximately 10,000 men at Etruria. The Senate upon becoming aware of this issued a senatus consultum ultimum declaring Catiline and his army as enemies of the state. Finally, Cicero arrested five men to be brought to the Senate for an immediate trial, the outcome of which was an order for their executions which was delivered and enacted by the Senate.|$|E
