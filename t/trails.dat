5|$|A {{review of}} the National Waymarked <b>Trails</b> in Ireland by the National <b>Trails</b> Office in 2010 {{acknowledged}} these shortcomings and recommended that the Wicklow Way be selected as one of fourteen <b>trails</b> to be upgraded to a National Long Distance Trail. This is a proposed new standard of trail in Ireland, intended to meet international standards for outstanding <b>trails.</b> It would require sections on unsuitable roads to comprise less than 10% of the total trail and for appropriate support services – accommodation, meals, transport, luggage transfer etc. – to be available. The review also recommended the development of shorter looped walks off the Wicklow Way and improving parking facilities.|$|E

5|$|The Red River <b>Trails</b> {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer <b>trails</b> and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western <b>trails</b> in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other <b>trails</b> presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the <b>trails</b> were located.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse <b>trails</b> to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville.

5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek.

2500|$|This <b>trail</b> is 0.4 mile long, it is {{a medium}} {{challenge}} <b>trail.</b> Like <b>Trail</b> #5, {{it is located}} north of the parking area, and starts where <b>Trail</b> #7 end. Also, like <b>trail</b> #5, {{there is a significant}} amount of mud on this <b>trail,</b> though less so during the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this <b>trail</b> from the visitor's parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of <b>Trail</b> #7 (the Camping Area <b>trail,</b> 0.1 mile long) and cross the bridge over the Doña Juana Creek. <b>Trail</b> #9 begins at this bridge. Heading to the left from the bridge is the path for <b>Trail</b> #8, but heading straight up (northbound) gets hikers onto <b>Trail</b> #9, the Doña Petra <b>Trail.</b> (Like <b>trail</b> #5, the [...] "Las Cuarenta" [...] <b>trail,</b> <b>Trail</b> #9 will also bring the hiker to State Route PR-564, but being a shorter <b>trail,</b> it does not encounter PR-564 as far north as <b>Trail</b> #5 does.)
