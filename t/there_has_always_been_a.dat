5|$|Pest {{control is}} at least as old as agriculture, as <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> need to keep crops free from pests. As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. Ferrets were domesticated by 500 AD in Europe for use as mousers. Mongooses were {{introduced}} into homes to control rodents and snakes, probably by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

Added to this, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of halination.

25|$|In {{addition}} to Catholics, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> large accompanying Protestant minority.

When the British took over the administration of Bengal, they too felt its need and traded for salt. Gradually they monopolized Orissa salt all over Bengal.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{close and}} affectionate tie between the Notre Dame Band {{and the rest}} of the Notre Dame community. Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., who founded the {{university}} in 1842, is strongly rumored to have been a clarinet player. And while it is possible that the Notre Dame Band and musical studies originated with the university that same year, the earliest reference to the band is in 1846 when it played at the first graduation ceremony. The importance of music on campus also caused a Music Hall/Auditorium to be built as the third major building of the new school after the classroom/dormitory building (The Golden Dome) and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana. The legendary football coach, Knute Rockne, played flute for Notre Dame, and former Athletic Director Edward Moose Krause spent some years studying music before putting his clarinet on the shelf and devoting himself to athletics.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{at least}} the {{emergence}} of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized by purists. According to Bruce Johnson, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> [...] "tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form". Traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, the 1970s jazz fusion era and much else as periods of debasement {{of the music and}} betrayals of the tradition. An alternative viewpoint is that jazz is able to absorb and transform influences from diverse musical styles, and that, by avoiding the creation of 'norms', other newer, avant-garde forms of jazz will be free to emerge.|$|E

2500|$|Salsa was {{the fourth}} {{innovation}} based on Cuban music to hit the US, and differed {{in that it was}} initially developed in the US, not in Cuba. Because Cuba has so many indigenous types of music <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> problem in marketing the 'product' abroad to people who did not understand the differences between rhythms that, to a Cuban, are quite distinct. So, twice in the 20th century, a kind of product label was developed to solve this problem. The first occasion was in the 1930s after [...] "The Peanut Vendor" [...] became an international success. It was called a 'rumba' even though it really {{had nothing to do with}} genuine rumba: the number was obviously a son pregon.

2500|$|With the {{increase}} in tourism, coal decreased in importance. However, shortly after the Second World War a ponderous industrialization effort was commenced, the so-called [...] "Piani di Rinascita" [...] (Rebirth Plans), with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island. [...] This included the realization of new dams and roads, reforestation, agricultural zones on reclaimed marsh land, and large industrial complexes (primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations). These efforts to create jobs have largely failed due to {{the high costs of}} transportation that could not compensate the cheap labor. In the 1950s and 1960s many Sardinians migrated to Northern and Central Italy (Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany and Rome) and the rest of Europe (mostly in Germany, France and Belgium) but also from the interior of the island to the coastal cities of Cagliari, Olbia and Sassari. In the early 1960s with the creation of petrochemical industries, thousands of ex-farmers became specialised workers, and some others would commence to work on the newly established military bases, created primarily for the NATO. Even now, around 60% of all Italian and US military installations in Italy are on Sardinia, whose area is less than one-tenth of all the Italian territory and whose population is little more than the 2,5%; furthermore, they comprise over 35.000 hectares used for experimental weapons testing, where 80% of the military explosives in Italy are used. Ever since, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> local protest movement expressing deep concern over the environmental degradation the military activities would cause.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the basic framework for indirect discrimination is found for the issue of equal pay between men and women. Because the Equal Pay Act 1970 preceded other legislation, {{and so did the}} TFEU article 157, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> separate body of rules. It is not entirely clear why this should continue, particularly because in several respects it is harder to bring equal pay claims on grounds of gender than for other protected characteristics, meaning that the task of closing the gender pay gap is frustrated compared to race, sexual orientation or other grounds. First, a claim must relate to [...] "pay", concept which is generally construed widely to encompass any kind of remuneration for work, as well as sick pay or for maternity leave. Second, under the EA 2010 section 79, a comparator must be real, and employed by the same employer, or an associated employer, and at the same establishment, or a different establishment if common terms apply. It is usually harder to find a real comparator than imagine a hypothetical one. Third, under EA 2010 section 65, the claimant must be doing [...] "broadly similar" [...] work to the comparator, or work [...] "rated as equivalent", or work which is of [...] "equal value". These criteria, which at their broadest focus on the [...] "value" [...] of labour, make explicit what a court must take into account, but also potentially constrain the court {{in a way that the}} open ended test for indirect discrimination does not. Fourth, under section 128 there is a time limit of six months to bring a claim, but unlike the three-month time limit for other discrimination claims it cannot be extended at the court's discretion. However, equal pay claims do import an [...] "equality clause" [...] into the claimant's contract of employment. This allows a claim to be pursued in the High Court as well as a Tribunal. It is unclear what principle justifies the segregation of unequal pay claims based on sex, compared to all other protected characteristics.|$|E
