40|$|Abstract: Product {{functional}} analysis {{is the foundation}} of product modularization. Before product module division, function-related analysis of every component or function unit is necessary. As for completely innovative products, the traditional methods are consistent with the habits of designers mind and can help product innovation, while {{it is difficult to determine}} <b>the</b> <b>function</b> decomposition granularity. <b>The</b> issue of <b>function</b> decomposition granularity determination challenges the same for mature products. To achieve <b>the</b> <b>function</b> decomposition of made-products, bottom-up function decomposition are proposed and researched. Firstly, determine <b>the</b> possible <b>function</b> unit (bottom function) list for mature products. Secondly, cluster <b>the</b> <b>function</b> units to get their parent functions, and then execute iterated clustering of parent <b>functions</b> until <b>the</b> parent <b>function</b> is product overall function. Finally, products function tree is obtained to achieve <b>function</b> decomposition. In <b>the</b> proposed methodology, <b>the</b> <b>function</b> hierarchy matrix and function incidence matrix are defined to describe <b>the</b> <b>function</b> and <b>the</b> <b>function</b> unit table is built based on which <b>the</b> <b>function</b> units of products are achieved. <b>The</b> relationship between <b>function</b> units achieved above is expressed by using <b>the</b> <b>function</b> hierarchy matrix and <b>function</b> incidence matrix. <b>The</b> <b>function</b> incidence matrix is operated to get <b>the</b> <b>function</b> tree and function decomposition based on bottom-up method by using-intercept.
