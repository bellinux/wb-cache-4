5|$|Early on May 6, three Royal Navy ships sailed into Quebec Harbour. Troops {{on these}} ships were {{immediately}} sent {{into the city}} and, not long after, General Guy Carleton formed them up and marched <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American siege camp. General John Thomas, then {{in command of the}} American forces, had already been making arrangements to retreat, but the British arrival threw his troops into a panic. He led a disorganized retreat that eventually reached Sorel on about May 18.|$|E
5|$|By {{the year}} 737, Emperor Xuanzong {{discarded}} {{the policy of}} conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided {{to them in the}} equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.|$|E

The main evacuation point was the DAO Compound at Tan Son Nhat; buses moved through the city picking up passengers and driving <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport, with the first buses arriving at Tan Son Nhat shortly after noon. The first CH-53 landed at the DAO compound in the afternoon, and by the evening, 395 Americans and more than 4,000 Vietnamese had been evacuated. By 23:00 the U.S. Marines who were providing security were withdrawing and arranging the demolition of the DAO office, American equipment, files, and cash. Air America UH-1s also participated in the evacuation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December news reached Alden and Barker that two days earlier Japanese {{aircraft}} had sunk the US gunboat USS Panay in the Yangtze River near Nanjing. Alden and Barker discreetly prepared racks of ammunition for their 4"/50 caliber guns, but the IJN ships continued to stand by and assist. President McKinley moved closer inshore and embarked about 400 of President Hoovers passengers and about 230 of her crew. Japanese Navy flat-bottomed boats brought them from the shore out to meet President McKinleys boats and a motor launch, which then ferried <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liner. President McKinley then left for Manila, leaving behind President Hoovers officers, steerage passengers and the last 100 of her crew on Kasho-to.|$|E

On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E

500|$|Periodic comets or short-period comets are {{generally}} {{defined as those}} having orbital periods of less than 200 years. They usually orbit more-or-less in the ecliptic plane {{in the same direction}} as the planets. Their orbits typically take <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region of the outer planets (Jupiter and beyond) at aphelion; for example, the aphelion of Halley's Comet is a little beyond the orbit of Neptune. Comets whose aphelia are near a major planet's orbit are called its [...] "family". Such families are thought to arise from the planet capturing formerly long-period comets into shorter orbits.|$|E
500|$|Another {{interesting}} {{recovery method}} conservationists and biologists are using is called Fish Transportation. Since many juvenile salmon perish at each dam while swimming {{out to the}} ocean, massive ships filter and collect these baby salmon by size and take <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean for a ride, {{where they can be}} guaranteed to make it alive to saltwater. This method raises controversy to the effectiveness and costs, since this method is extremely expensive, almost costing $15million. Another similar method to transport fish across the dams is the [...] "Fish Gun" [...] method. Engineers at Whooshh Innovations have developed a [...] "Whooshh Fish Transport System" [...] that literally collects salmon and shoots them above the dam at high speed {{in an effort to get}} them across the dams.|$|E

After first being told not to study at the table by Lois, Brian notices that Chris's history textbook is hopelessly out of date. Upset by this, Lois goes to a PTA meeting to complain about the textbook. Responding to her grievances, Principal Shepherd explains that the school cannot afford new textbooks due to the school's loss of federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act {{as a result of their}} low test scores. Forced to make a decision on how to improve the scores and the school's overall performance, Principal Shepherd decides to expel the school's [...] "dumbest" [...] student, who is revealed to be Chris Griffin.|$|E

500|$|The Holy Jesus Hospital {{has been}} {{the centre of the}} National Trust’s Inner City Project. By August 2004, £800,000 had been spent on renovating the building. [...] Funds for the {{restoration}} of the site came from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Tyne and Wear Partnership. The project had been running since 1987 in the east end of Newcastle working with young people from 12-25 and with the over 50s, taking <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> countryside. [...] The National Trust needed a central office to expand their work into other inner city areas, so a 25-year lease was negotiated with the council. The Exhibition Room on the site features touch screens and 3D models to help teach people about the site's history of helping the townspeople. In the book The Remains of Distant Times: Archaeology and the National Trust, Priscilla Boniface criticizes what she believes to be the National Trust's lack of interest in operating in urban environments but praises the Inner City Project as a step towards rectifying this. She wrote [...] "Its occasional ventures - such as the Newcastle Inner City Project...by their frequent mention in National Trust communications, merely serve to underline how few of their type the Trust has to call on for report." [...] She argues that although the aim of introducing town dwellers to the countryside is [...] "laudable", the [...] "respectful and serious suggestion might be made, though, that a person or person's might be usefully employed also with the objective of raising National Trust people's understanding of and {{confidence in their ability to}} visit and enjoy, or at least encounter, the city." [...] However, Collins and Kay cite research suggesting that the scheme has been effective in promoting [...] "social inclusion". They note, however, that the project has been limited by the funds made available to it.|$|E
