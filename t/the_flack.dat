Jason Lipshutz from Billboard complimented the [...] "club-ready single" [...] for its [...] "bouncy hook and slick verses" [...] {{and called the}} song [...] "the perfect precursor to Wale's long-awaited debut". Mehan Jayasuriya from PopMatters commended the song for being a [...] "token party jam" [...] on the album track list. She added that [...] "for all <b>the</b> <b>flack</b> that the [...] has caught, it's still an indisputably catchy song, even if the 9th Wonder and Nick Catchdubs reworking from [...] Back to the Feature stands as the definitive version." [...] Andres Tardio from HipHopDX believed {{the composition of the}} song as [...] "Pop-friendly". A reviewer for XXL compared and described [...] "Chillin" [...] as [...] "distinctly D.C.-sounding anthem". David Jeffries from AllMusic praised Wale's [...] "natural delivery and quirky sense of humor" [...] in the song, likening his vocals to that of Jay-Z and Gaga's vocals to that of singer Rihanna. Describing [...] "Chillin" [...] as a [...] "club-friendly hopper", Chris Richards from The Washington Post believed that using Rihanna or M.I.A. on the track would have made it successful, rather than Gaga who was then considered a relatively unknown singer. Richards recalled a similar situation when Washington D.C. based go-go band Experience Unlimited had collaborated with androgynous singer Grace Jones on a track. Sobhi Youssef from Sputnikmusic noticed that the song's production made it sound like a different track than the rest of Attention Deficit.|$|E

Rap-Up magazine said the performance had eccentric dancing and pink escapades. However a Chris Ryan from MTV Buzzworthy was less impressed with the duo appearing as The Jetsons. He said [...] "The WTF? ... Look, we LOVE Nicki Minaj. We would fake-marry her if Drake hadn't already fake-married her. And one thing we really, really love about Nicki Minaj is the wild and crazy looks she breaks out. But given <b>the</b> <b>flack</b> he's taken {{in the last few}} days over his, um, unique choice in attire, she might have wanted to pregame with Will.i.am a little harder, regarding his stage fashion." [...] He later went on to say that Minaj's performance lived up to expectations. [...] "And of course, Nicki more than delivered. Harajuku Barbie really brought the house down with [...] "Check It Out", You have to see it to believe it." ...|$|E
