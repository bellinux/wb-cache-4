[...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{looked at}} me and then away, and her {{beautiful}} blue intelligent eyes <b>told</b> <b>me</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt baffled and worried.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there are}} to be several of us," [...] said Newman. [...] "Mrs. Tristram <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to-day <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had {{received}} a card and sent an acceptance." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "She {{is a very}} {{pure and}} high spirit--a girl of {{wonderful}} beauty--so they say. I have never seen her myself--she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to-day <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would watch over you." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "My aunt <b>told</b> <b>me</b> later <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had never}} felt as downhearted about my fate as when <b>she</b> {{received}} <b>that</b> card. <b>She</b> said <b>that</b> obviously I had lost my mind." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; {{only you}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had gone some days ago. Well, I am sound again and {{prepared}} to march, but say, how is my foster-son?" ...|$|E

60|$|He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{presently}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had started}} off for home, and {{drove me to}} the ferry, behind an old grey pony. On the way {{he came back to}} his offer of the other day.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is barely}} nine o'clock, Mademoiselle, but Monsieur Bellamy--Mademoiselle <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wished to receive him {{whenever}} he came. He {{is in the}} boudoir now, and very impatient." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What was the {{use when}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not care for me? Of course I should have asked her father.

60|$|I {{found she}} was very well pleased with the discourse, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> seriously <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be very glad to make him {{sensible}} of her just resentment, and either to bring him on again, or have the satisfaction of her revenge being as public as possible.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don’t know," [...] ses Peter; [...] "but this chap <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> won’t {{walk out}} with anybody agin, unless it’s another prize-fighter. Her pride won’t let her, I s’pose." ...|$|E
