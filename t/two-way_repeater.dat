50|$|One of TX RX Systems most {{successful}} product lines are their Signal Boosters. In {{response to a}} requirement by Motorola Communications in 1978, TX RX Systems manufactured the first UHF <b>two-way</b> <b>repeater</b> amplifiers in an Inland Steel Corporation coal mine in Illinois. In addition, TX RX Systems brand Combiners and Antennas {{were included in the}} system configuration for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) implementation of Project 25 (P25) and mesh network to secure the southwest border.|$|E
50|$|These systems {{generally}} {{consist of}} one or more repeaters used to maintain communications between a dispatch fleet of mobile or hand-held walkie talkie radios. One- to five-channel systems may be conventional <b>two-way</b> radio <b>repeaters.</b> More than five channel systems must be trunked.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} he starred in The Green Hornet, Williams had become {{successful}} investing in various commercial ventures; a TV Guide profile of 1966, titled [...] "Banker with a Sting," [...] characterized him as [...] "your friendly neighborhood tycoon." [...] He retired from acting in 1982 to open a Santa Monica, California communications company that leases time on six <b>two-way</b> radio <b>repeater</b> stations. Williams was also a longtime Reserve Deputy Sheriff with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and worked at the Malibu, California, substation.|$|R
5000|$|An autopatch, {{sometimes}} called a phone patch, is {{a feature of}} an amateur radio (or other type of <b>two-way</b> radio) <b>repeater</b> or base station to access an outgoing telephone connection. [...] Users with a transceiver capable of producing touch tones (DTMF signals) can make a telephone call, typically limited by settings in the autopatch module to be only to flat-rate numbers, such as local calls or toll-free numbers. The term phone patch more accurately describes {{a system that is}} dialed and connected by a user manually operating a base station, which was more common before computer technology made automation of the process easier.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, transoceanic cables were coaxial cables that {{transmitted}} frequency-multiplexed voiceband signals. A {{high voltage}} direct current {{on the inner}} conductor powered <b>repeaters</b> (<b>two-way</b> amplifiers placed at intervals along the cable). The first-generation repeaters remain among the most reliable vacuum tube amplifiers ever designed. Later ones were transistorized. Many of these cables are still usable, but have been abandoned because their capacity {{is too small to}} be commercially viable. Some have been used as scientific instruments to measure earthquake waves and other geomagnetic events.|$|R
50|$|A {{broadcast}} relay station, satellite station, relay transmitter, broadcast translator (U.S.), rebroadcaster (Canada) or <b>repeater</b> (<b>two-way</b> radio), Complementary station (Mexico), is {{a broadcast}} transmitter which repeats or transponds the signal of another radio station or television station, usually {{to an area}} {{not covered by the}} signal of the originating station. They may serve, for example, to expand the broadcast range of a television or radio station beyond the primary signal's coverage area, or to improve service {{in a part of the}} main coverage area which receives a poor signal due to geographic constraints. These transmitters may be (but are not usually) used to create a single-frequency network. They may also be used by a radio station on either AM or FM to establish a presence on the other band.Less commonly, a rebroadcaster may be owned by a community group rather than the owner of the primary station. An example is WHLS/WHLX of Port Huron, MI which purchased a translator, and shortly after that switched to an Alternative Rock format only mentioning their FM translator (except for their legal top of the hour ID). Neither of the AM frequencies is mentioned.|$|R
