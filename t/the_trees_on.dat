5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often moves through <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size {{tends to be}} smaller than that of South American {{squirrel monkey}}s, but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, {{with a mean of}} 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, Nearing and Helen Knothe lived {{together}} in Winhall in rural Vermont, {{where they had}} purchased a rather large forest tract for $2200 and a moderate-sized farm for $2500. Nearing and Knothe lived a largely ascetic and self-reliant life, growing much of their own food and putting up nine stone buildings {{over the course of}} two decades. Cash was earned from producing maple syrup and maple sugar from <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> their land and from Scott Nearing's occasional paid lectures. They married in 1947.|$|E
25|$|The pilot episode (1979) {{and first}} two series (1980–1981) were all filmed during early spring before the holiday camp was {{opened to the}} public for the summer. This is {{noticeable}} during outdoor scenes, because most of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> the camp site are bare. Since it was so cold during filming a lot of the outdoor scenes, the cast were continuously complaining about having to appear in summer clothing, and Jeffrey Holland was treated for hypothermia during the first series because his character spent most of the time in the swimming pool.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 Brooklyn tornado {{hit this}} area, {{specifically}} 68th Street and Bay Ridge Avenue between Third and Fourth Avenues. Eleven houses {{had to be}} vacated after they suffered significant damage, and many of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> the two blocks toppled, landing on cars and stoops. The 4th Avenue Presbyterian Church had its very large stained glass window blown out. As the tornado lifted, it peeled {{the roof of a}} nearby Nissan dealership and deforested 40% of Leif Ericson Park. The tornado has been rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds between 111 and 135 MPH.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} routes can be {{followed}} from Buttermere. Sour Milk Gill leads almost direct {{from the village}} into Bleaberry Comb, from where The Saddle can be gained. Alternatively the path to Scale Force can be used at the start. Climbing beside the fall itself leads to the reverse slope of Lincomb Edge, or an earlier turn up Far Ruddy Beck gives access into Ling Comb. From Ennerdale, the only break in <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> the northern side {{is followed by a}} path up Gillflinter Beck. This leads onward to the summit, the only access on the Ennerdale side of Buttermere Edge. Many walkers will combine Red Pike, High Stile and High Crag in a single outing from Buttermere or Gatesgarth.|$|E
500|$|Coolbrith's {{difficulties}} in Oakland followed by her trip to Chicago unsettled her friends {{who did not}} wish to see her move away and [...] "become an alien" [...] to California. John Muir had long been in the habit of sending Coolbrith letters, and the occasional box of fruit such as cherries picked from <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> his Martinez estate, and he made such an offering in late 1894, accompanied by a suggestion for a new career which he thought would keep her in the area—she could fill the position of San Francisco's librarian, recently vacated by John Vance Cheney. Coolbrith sent a response to Muir, thanking him for [...] "the fruit of your land, and the fruit of your brain". After signing the letter [...] "your old-time friend", she added a post-script comment: [...] "No, I cannot have Mr. Cheney's place. I am disqualified by sex." [...] San Francisco required that their librarian be a man.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} on the San Joaquin River Delta. The set, imitating a {{southern}} prison farm, was built in Stockton, California. The filmmakers sent a crew to Tavares Road Prison in Tavares, Florida to take photographs and measurements, where Pearce had served his time. The structures that were built in Stockton included [...] barracks, a mess hall, the warden's quarters, a guard shack and dog kennels. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> the set were decorated with spanish moss that the producers took to the area. The construction soon attracted the attention of a county building inspector who confused it with migrant worker housing and ordered it [...] "condemned for code violations." [...] The opening scene where Newman cuts the parking meters [...] was filmed in Lodi, California. Meanwhile, the scene in which Luke is chased by bloodhounds and other exteriors were shot in Jacksonville, Florida, at Callahan Road Prison. Luke was played by a stunt actor, using dogs from the Florida Department of Corrections.|$|E
500|$|The species {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the scientific community when explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell observed <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> his expedition through Queensland in 1848 and published an account in Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia in the same year. He came across them as he ascended Mount Abundance near present-day Roma, remarking that [...] "The trunk bulged out in the middle like a barrel, to nearly twice the diameter at the ground, or of that at the first springing of the branches above. These were small in proportion to their great girth, and the whole tree looked very odd In the same publication, English botanist John Lindley provided the first formal description. Lindley placed it in the genus Delabechea as the sole representative—Delabechea rupestris. The genus name was selected by Mitchell to honor the director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Henry De la Beche, while the Latin specific epithet rupestris (meaning living among rocks) alludes to the rocky hilltop habitat of specimens observed by Mitchell. Ferdinand von Mueller, the Government Botanist in Victoria, renamed it Brachychiton delabechei in 1862, incorporating the genus Delabechea into Brachychiton.|$|E
500|$|Forces under General Martinov {{assaulted}} {{the central}} wing of Fort 56. Here the obstacles were intact, and 200 Polish soldiers repelled three consecutive assaults by a famed Moscow Guards Regiment. The Russians lost two regimental commanders before their forces managed {{to reach the}} moat. When a force of 2,900 Russians {{reached the top of}} the rampart, they were surprised by a staunch defence of a second rampart behind it. Russian infantry retreated and hid under the first rampart. Biernacki, fighting in the northern wing, managed to expel the Russian infantry, but was killed in action during the counter-attack, and the Poles withdrew back into <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> the far side of the fort. To stabilise the situation, General Sowiński ordered a company of the 8th Line Infantry Regiment to leave the central wing and join the fight in the north. The new commanding officer of the north wing, Maj. Lipski, organised yet another counter-attack. Shouting [...] "Mates, remember Grochów, remember Iganie!" [...] he led his men in a charge and pushed the Russians back once again, but the impetus was lost and the Russians retained control of the rampart to the north-west. A short stalemate ensued, in which the Polish infantrymen and their single twelve-pounder carronade prevented much larger enemy forces from entering the fort.|$|E
