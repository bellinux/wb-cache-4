5|$|A nocturnal {{lifestyle}} {{has been}} suggested for the primitive ceratopsian Protoceratops. However, comparisons between the scleral rings of Protoceratops and Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles indicate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{never truly}} domesticated, {{a small number}} of jungle cats have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been used to help control rodent populations.|$|E
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other flapping theropods, implying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the company}} implies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{initially}} <b>have</b> supplied ship models to the Admiralty, like Clyde Model Dockyard and Stevens Model Dockyard.|$|R
50|$|Many {{drivers were}} {{operating}} motor vehicles <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been trained or qualified to drive. This {{lack of training}} resulted in {{a large number of}} preventable traffic deaths and accidents.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{a wealth}} of {{skeletal}} remains, Diplodocus {{is one of the}} best-studied dinosaurs. Many aspects of its lifestyle have been subjects of various theories over the years. Comparisons between the scleral rings of diplodocines and modern birds and reptiles suggest <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E
5|$|Some flower-feeding thrips {{pollinate}} {{the flowers}} they are feeding on, and some authors suspect <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{been among the}} first insects to evolve a pollinating relationship with their host plants. Scirtothrips dorsalis carries pollen of commercially important chili peppers. Darwin found that thrips could not be kept out by any netting when he conducted experiments by keeping away larger pollinators.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of Stegosaurus plates {{has been much}} debated. Initially thought of as some form of armor, {{they appear to have}} been too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected. The plates' large size suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> served to increase the apparent height of the animal, either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species, in some form of sexual display, although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates. More recently, researchers have proposed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> helped to control the body temperature of the animal, in a similar way to the sails of the pelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus (and modern elephant and rabbit ears). The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood.|$|E
50|$|The {{entire body}} of confuciusornithids {{was covered in}} contour feathers, except for the foot, base of beak, and the tarsometatarsus, the bone {{directly}} attached to the foot. It appears <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> had down feathers.|$|R
50|$|Children {{whose parents}} have leprosy, {{or who have}} had leprosy themselves, can benefit from school {{scholarship}} programmes. TLM pays for the child's schooling, allowing them to gain an education <b>that</b> <b>they</b> otherwise <b>may</b> <b>have</b> missed out on.|$|R

5|$|After Jon {{discusses}} the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa criticizes him for attacking without gathering more men and predicts that Ramsay will defeat them. Jon {{insists that the}} army is the largest one possible. When Jon asks Melisandre not to resurrect him if he dies in battle, she {{says that it is}} up to the Lord of Light. Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving Stannis and Mance and acknowledge <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> served the wrong king all along. Davos discovers the pyre where Shireen and the wooden stag he carved for her were burned.|$|E
5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences in structure {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E
5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E
40|$|Sigma-delta {{modulated}} {{systems have}} a number of very appealing properties and are, therefore, heavily used in analog to digital converters, amplifiers, and modulators. This paper presents new results which indicate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> significant potential for general purpose arithmetic processing...|$|R
5000|$|In 2017 after Republican {{controlled}} Congress {{failed to}} repeal the Affordable Care Act, Brooks stated on SiriusXM Patriot, “We have Republicans {{who do not want}} to repeal ObamaCare. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> campaigned <b>that</b> way, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> voted <b>that</b> way {{a couple of years ago}} when it didn’t make any difference.” ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{one point}} is {{specially}} noticeable about these plants of the coal; namely, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> at least <b>have</b> grown in swamps.|$|R
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they {{may have played a}} role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E
5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales {{have been told}} of the corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration {{has stated}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> to close Innherred Sykehus Station. The station {{is located in}} a curve and within the {{signaling}} area of Levanger Station, and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate has required the station to be corrected by 2012. Because of the adjacent Levanger Hospital, the station is one of the busiest on the system, with 90,000 annual riders. One possible solution is to move the platforms of Levanger Station closer towards the hospital and thus serve both the town and the hospital from the same station.|$|E
5000|$|In rhetorical terms, {{the phrase}} {{can be thought}} of as {{indicating}} an unintentional apophasis—where the speaker who [...] "protests too much" [...] in favor of some assertion puts into others' minds the idea that the assertion is false, something <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> considered before.|$|R
25|$|In 1866, Watts-Russell sold {{many of his}} {{properties}} and leased their homestead. This implies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> intended to return to New Zealand. They {{spend much of their}} time away in France. They did return in 1871, though, and lived adjacent to Cathedral Square until his death.|$|R
50|$|The Benghazi station transmits on 675 AM (medium wave), Bayda on 1125 AM and Misrata on 1449 AM. The output {{powers of}} the three {{transmitters}} are substantial - 100 kilowatts (kW), 500 kW and 500 kW respectively - but variable reception indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> sometimes <b>have</b> operated on reduced power.|$|R
5|$|The {{families}} {{of individuals who}} have inherited or {{are at risk of}} inheriting HD have generations of experience of HD, but may be unaware of recent breakthroughs in understanding the disease, and of the availability of genetic testing. Genetic counseling benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded beliefs <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have,</b> and helping them consider their future options and plans. Also covered is information concerning family planning choices, care management, and other considerations.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the fort was artificially raised by the Romans, using earth dug from the foundation ditch, {{to bring it up}} {{to the level of the}} projecting step on the back of the wall. No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by excavators. A number of Roman hearths are situated at regular intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been the site of wooden barrack blocks. The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have left little trace.|$|E
5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some debate whether hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, the {{men have}} all left the {{hospital}} {{by the time the}} doctors get back to confirm their hypothesis. It is left uncertain how they got poisoned, but <b>they</b> also mention <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> all <b>have</b> used a lot of salt because heavy drinkers have a low blood salt concentration.|$|R
25|$|Given the inchoate {{nature of}} {{the various types of}} {{football}} at <b>that</b> time, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been playing simple mob football. Alternatively, they could have been playing in accordance with the recently published Rugby school rules (1845) or the Cambridge rules (1848), the latter being the forerunner of the laws of association football.|$|R
2500|$|The prayer recited for {{the bread}} and the water {{is found in the}} Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants.

5|$|The {{relationships}} between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong at first. His {{mother and grandmother}} became the first women to be allowed into the Senate, and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of Clarissima, and Maesa the more unorthodox Mater Castrorum et Senatus ("Mother of the army camp and of the Senate"). They held the title of Augusta as well, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been the power behind the throne. Indeed, they exercised great influence over the young emperor throughout his reign, {{and can be found}} on many coins and inscriptions—a rare honor for Roman women.|$|E
5|$|When the Seanchan {{attack the}} White Tower, its {{fractured}} state prevents an effective defense. Many Aes Sedai are captured or killed until Egwene, leading {{a group of}} novices, succeeds in driving them off. Siuan Sanche, Gawyn Trakand, and Gareth Bryne mount a rescue of Egwene. They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when they extract her against her orders. After awakening in the camp, she argues <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> ruined her chances to gain credit in the Tower for {{the defeat of the}} Seanchan.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
50|$|The Israeli {{decision}} {{was to be}} conveyed to the Arab nations by the United States. The U.S. was informed of the decision, but {{not that it was}} to transmit it. There is no evidence of receipt from Egypt or Syria, and some historians claim <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> never <b>have</b> received the offer.|$|R
5000|$|Omnicia: On certain occasions, when Kevin {{runs out}} of clues, he would ask the Chief to contact an omniscient {{informant}} known as Omnicia. Contacting Omnicia {{takes a lot of}} power, according to the Chief. She warns Kevin <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> enough power, but Kevin will tell her <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have to risk it.|$|R
50|$|A lease-option {{allows the}} seller {{to sell a}} {{property}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> otherwise been able to sell. In many cases a seller can net more money when offering terms to a buyer. Sellers can often avoid paying a Realtor fee by using a lease-option agreement (as they have already found the buyer themselves).|$|R
