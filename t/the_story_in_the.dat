5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear.

5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the feel of a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later games.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, with Love was {{released}} in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published {{a few weeks later}} by Macmillan. In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of From Russia, with Love was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Daily Express in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in Life on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed From Russia, with Love as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw the sales of the Pan paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E
5|$|In Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder, {{the player}} assumes {{the roles of}} the main protagonist Chihaya Kisakinomiya and the {{secondary}} character Kaoruko Nanahara. There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> adult versions of Futari no Elder, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Chihaya and a given heroine having sex. The gameplay is somewhat altered in the PSP version. The PSP version has the sexual content removed, the scenarios of Utano Sasou and Kaori Kamichika that appeared in the Windows version are removed, and it contains newly added scenarios of You Kashiwagi and Hatsune Minase. There are three additional sub episodes in the Windows version of Futari no Elder.|$|E
5|$|The Etoiles {{are elected}} {{after going through}} {{what is known as}} , which {{consists}} of three competitions in the light novels and the manga versions. The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition, and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile Couple. In the anime, the competition aspect of the story is toned down. Still, it facilitates the culmination of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finale, and thus serves an important purpose. Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election, at which the president of the student council from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for the colors of the pendants: one is red, the other is blue. The older student receives the blue pendant and the younger of the two is given the red pendant.|$|E

5|$|Unlike both horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005)which {{were also}} {{produced}} by Bay, Form, and Fullerit {{was decided that}} Friday the 13th {{would not be a}} period piece. Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000s. In October 2007, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were hired to write a script for Friday the 13th. Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel. Nispel was apprehensive about taking the job, mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise, but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project. Principal photography began on April 21, 2008, in Austin, Texas, and finished on June 13, 2008.|$|E
