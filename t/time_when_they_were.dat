5|$|For his {{selection}} of sailing master, Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George Tyson, who both initially declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson assistant navigator. Budington and Tyson had decades of experience between them captaining whaling vessels. In effect, the Polaris now had three captains, a fact which would weigh {{heavily on the}} fate of the expedition. Further complicating matters, in 1863 Budington and Hall had quarrelled because Budington had denied permission for Hall to bring his Inuit guides, Joseph Ebierbing and Tookoolito, with him on an expedition at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ill and in Budington's care.|$|E
5|$|With {{nineteen}} {{other ethnic}} Chinese, including his former schoolmate Phoa Keng Hek, Lie was an establishing {{member of the}} Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan (THHK) school system and social organisation in 1900. Meant to promote ethnic Chinese rights at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> treated as second-class citizens and provide standardised formal education to ethnic Chinese students where the Dutch had not, the organisation {{was based on the}} teachings of Confucius and opened schools for both boys and girls. The THHK grew quickly and expanded into different fields, and Lie helped organise a debating club, sports club, and charity fairs and concerts. From 1903 to 1904 Lie was a managing member of the board, serving mainly as its treasurer.|$|E
5|$|Less {{concrete}} changes {{include the}} growing assertiveness of the Dominions within the British Empire. Battles such as Gallipoli for Australia and New Zealand, and Vimy Ridge for Canada led to increased national pride {{and a greater}} reluctance to remain subordinate to London. These battles were often portrayed favourably in these nations' propaganda as symbolic of their power during the war. The war released pent-up indigenous nationalism, as populations tried {{to take advantage of}} the precedent set by the introduction of self-determination in eastern Europe. Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919–21), India (1919), Egypt (1919–23), Palestine (1920–21) and Iraq (1920) at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> supposed to be demilitarising. Nevertheless, Britain's only territorial loss came in Ireland, where the delay in finding a resolution to the home rule issue, along with the 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals, and led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Having left Thompson's tradition, Buczynski {{decided to}} form his own form of Wicca, which he claimed had {{actually}} dated {{back to the}} Palaeolithic and transmitted to him by a figure whose anonymity he had to protect. Referring to this new tradition as Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft or the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, it was heavily influenced by the Welsh mythology contained in texts like The Mabinogion and the Arthurian legends which fascinated him, despite his lack of Welsh heritage. It took as its basis {{the structure of the}} Gardnerian tradition, with its Book of Shadows being largely based upon that which he had obtained through his work with Thompson, accompanied by sections taken from the recently published Lady Sheba's The Book of Shadows. Officially founded in October 1972, later that year an outer court was founded through which to teach interested persons who were not yet initiated. Notably, he welcomed LGBT people and non-caucasians into his tradition at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> denied entry to most other Wiccan covens. Although taking an open attitude to spiritual seekers, Buczynski prevented the occult investigator, Hans Holzer, from entering the outer coven when the latter requested admission to undertake research for his book The Witchcraft Report; like many in the Pagan and occult community, Buczynski was wary of Holzer's intentions and the sensationalist claims he purported in his publications.|$|E

25|$|The Church did not {{invent the}} idea of {{witchcraft}} as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity.

25|$|In early 2007, {{the airline}} {{announced}} plans to introduce Sky-Torah scrolls on each of its aircraft. These were effectively Torah scrolls which would be carried on board its flight for Jewish passengers to use for prayer.

Later on in 2007, an Israir passenger announced he was filing a lawsuit against the airline for misadvertising the legroom they offered on their aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Hoods {{comprise}} {{two basic}} patterns: full shape or simple shape. The traditional full-shape hood {{consists of a}} cape, cowl, and liripipe, as is used at Cambridge. At Oxford, the bachelors' and masters' hoods use simple hoods that have lost their cape and retain only the cowl and liripipe. Some universities only have a cape and cowl and no liripipe or just consist a cape only; these are classed separately under the Aberdeen shape style. Various other universities have different shapes and patterns of hoods, in some cases corresponding to the pattern current at the ancient universities at the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> founded, and in others representing a completely new design.|$|E
25|$|Johnston {{graduated}} {{high school}} {{and moved on to}} Harvard University in 1959, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree, magna cum laude, in 1963. While at Harvard, under the coaching of Cooney Weiland, Johnston captained the varsity ice hockey team, was twice selected to the All-America team, and met and befriended Erich Segal, the two becoming jogging partners. In 1970, Segal wrote the best-selling novel Love Story, basing a character in the book—Davey, a captain of the hockey team—on Johnston. Johnston suffered three concussions from playing football and hockey; he was told by his doctor to either wear a helmet (at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unpopular) or stop playing hockey.|$|E

One of the largest of these paintings is a view of St. Bartholomew's Church at Lawrie Park Avenue, commonly known as , {{in the collection of the}} London National Gallery. Twelve oil paintings date from his stay in Upper Norwood and are listed and illustrated in the catalogue raisonné prepared jointly by his fifth child Ludovic-Rodolphe Pissarro and Lionello Venturi and published in 1939. These paintings include Norwood Under the Snow, and Lordship Lane Station, views of The Crystal Palace relocated from Hyde Park, Dulwich College, Sydenham Hill, All Saints Church Upper Norwood, and a lost painting of St. Stephen's Church.|$|E
25|$|Tanner {{achieved}} national notoriety {{with his}} position on labor disputes at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> characteristically numerous and violent, particularly in the Illinois coalfields. His position was non-partisanship, the first governor {{to make it a}} state policy. When violence broke out, he was quick to send state troops to quell the violence, and he was adamantly opposed to the importation of armed men by either side, using troops to enforce state laws against it. The most notable incidents of the day were at Virden (where imported armed men had fired on Illinois strikers), at Pana (racial strife between white and black coal miners, with the governor siding against the position of the white miners), and Carterville (where unarmed African Americans were shot by white miners, an incident vehemently condemned by the governor).|$|E

On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke.

25|$|During {{the period}} when Ohman {{discovered}} the stone, the journey of Leif Ericson to Vinland (North America) was being widely discussed and there was renewed interest in the Vikings throughout Scandinavia, stirred by the National Romanticism movement. Five years earlier Norway {{had participated in the}} World's Columbian Exposition by sending the Viking, a replica of the Gokstad ship to Chicago. There was also friction between Sweden and Norway (which ultimately led to Norway's independence from Sweden in 1905). Some Norwegians claimed the stone was a Swedish hoax and there were similar Swedish accusations because the stone references a joint expedition of Norwegians and Swedes at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ruled by the same king, after the Union of Kalmar. It is thought to be more than coincidental that the stone was found among Scandinavian newcomers in Minnesota, still struggling for acceptance and quite proud of their Nordic heritage.|$|E

He played three further List A matches for Devon, the last of which came against Sussex in the 1984 NatWest Trophy. In total, he played 10 List A matches, scoring just 92 runs at a batting average of 13.14, with a high score of 42.|$|E
25|$|Scott's planning, {{equipment}} and rations had {{been based on}} three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply. It also meant the Evans party of three {{had to try to}} split the ration pack (at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.|$|E
