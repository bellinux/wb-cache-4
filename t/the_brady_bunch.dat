5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch.</b> The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E

Later in 1977, Turner headlined her first solo concert tour, throughout Australia. In 1978, United Artists released Turner's third solo album, Rough, with distribution both in North America and Europe with EMI.

According to Lloyd Schwartz, his father and he {{initially}} balked at the idea because they felt a new series would harm <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> franchise.

5000|$|Thus, Room for One More and its contemporary, My Three Sons, [...] "were {{significant}} {{departures from}} the mom-and-pop {{model of the}} family" [...] that typified American television comedy of its era.

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{recorded}} by over 100 different artists. [...] In 1977, it {{was used as the}} closing theme song of <b>the</b> short-lived <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Hour. Thirty years after the original 1970 hit it was popularised again by becoming a patriotic and spiritual anthem for many during the post 9/11 recovery. It has also been used as a football chant and by gay rights groups. Taken literally, the song's lyrics convey two lovers who tell each other that no matter what hardships come their way, they will always be together. In general terms, it relates a message of strength in unity.|$|R
25|$|Mochrie {{remained}} active elsewhere {{during his}} tenure as a Whose Line member. In early 1994, he {{played the role of}} Mike Brady in a musical version of <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> directed by fellow Second City member Bruce Pirrie. In the production, Mochrie plays the character as caffeine-fuelled, jittery, and neurotic, an exaggeration of the Mike Brady television character, who often had a coffee in his hand on the show. Shortly before his move to the US version of Whose Line in 1998, Mochrie starred in Supertown Challenge as the host of game shows, which the show spoofed. He also appeared in several episodes of the Canadian improvisational comedy series Improv Heaven and Hell.|$|E

500|$|The {{elaborate}} <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> house set {{featured in}} the episode was built completely by the production crew, according to series co-star Gillian Anderson. She recounts the fact that, due to the original set having been long ago disassembled, people came [...] "from all over Los Angeles" [...] to get their pictures taken on the set. Anderson, who was a fan of popular sitcoms made by Sherwood Schwartz, like Gilligan's Island and <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> called the experience [...] "wild". The scene wherein Fogelman's house turns into an outside field was created via the technique of Chroma Keying. A shot of both <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> house and an outside field were filmed. Then, the actors were filmed against a blue screen. A matte of the scenes was then cut and the scenes were composited against each other. Due {{to the fact that}} the shot was an extended scene, Paul Rabwin later noted that the effects were [...] "a little tricky" [...] to get right; Rabwin noted that the shots' mattes had to cover the [...] "little strands of hair" [...] on Anderson's head, because missing the strands is what [...] "gives [...] away".|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Sarah married Andy Richter.
