5|$|A later {{development}} was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead tubing to operate pneumatic valves throughout the instrument. This allowed a lighter touch, and {{more flexibility in}} {{the location of the}} console, within a 50-foot (15-m) limit.

5|$|Contractors in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> faced many obstacles, {{both natural}} and man-made. They {{had to deal with}} rock {{formations}} and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E

25|$|The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> grammar {{associated}} with linguists like Goldberg and Lakoff looks mainly at the external relations of constructions {{and the structure}} of constructional networks. In terms of form and function, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> grammar puts psychological plausibility as its highest desideratum. It emphasizes experimental results and parallels with general cognitive psychology. It also draws on certain principles of cognitive linguistics. In the Goldbergian strand, constructions interact with each other in a network via four inheritance relations: polysemy link, subpart link, metaphorical extension, and finally instance link.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, Ronald Langacker's {{cognitive}} grammar {{framework is}} described as a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> grammar. Cognitive grammar deals mainly with the semantic content of constructions, and its central argument is that conceptual semantics is primary to the degree that form mirrors, or is motivated by, content. Langacker argues that even abstract grammatical units like part-of-speech classes are semantically motivated and involve certain conceptualizations.|$|E
25|$|In the La Tene II, or La Tene C era (2nd century BC), {{the foot}} of the fibula {{actually}} bent back to touch the bow and was wrapped around it.

25|$|The Carlton route, as sanctioned to the Company, was {{for single}} line with passing loops, a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{construction}}</b> not favoured by the Corporation, {{and during the}} construction of the various routes within the city, endeavours had always been made to have property demolished in order to widen the roadways, making them suitable for double track. A new Bill was therefore introduced by the Corporation to authorise a double line to Carlton, but owing to the dissolution of Parliament it was not passed until 1910.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used woods are Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, which offer excellent strength-to-weight ratios. Wooden structural members are joined with adhesive, usually epoxy. Unlike the wood construction techniques used in other applications, virtually all wooden joints in aircraft are simple butt joints, with plywood gussets. Joints {{are designed to be}} stronger than the members. After the structure has been completed, the aircraft is covered in aircraft fabric (usually aircraft-grade polyester). The advantage of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{is that it does not}} require complex tools and equipment, but commonplace items such as saw, planer, file, sandpaper, and clamps.|$|E
25|$|Most {{suspension}} bridges have open truss {{structures to}} support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) bridge collapse. Recent developments in bridge aerodynamics have allowed the re-introduction of plate structures first seen on the Severn bridge built in the 1960s. In {{the picture of the}} Yichang Bridge, note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} was erected around a rectangular central patio with arched galleries {{on all sides}} that serve as transitional elements {{to the office and}} room areas located throughout its periphery, all of which are typical of the period and style. A small fountain {{in the center of the}} patio served the dual purposes of ornamentation and water supply. This element no longer exists. The building was constructed of brick and a mixture of rubblework and stone. A series of symmetrically-placed thick walls carrying wooden beams, probably of ausubo or other Puerto Rican hard wood, support the brick roof. This structure has a basement, an uncommon element in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> on its south side.|$|E
25|$|One belief {{was that}} American Indians were too unsophisticated to have {{constructed}} such complex earthworks and artifacts. The associated stone, metal, and clay artifacts {{were thought to}} be too complex for the Indians to have made. In the American Southeast, and Midwest, numerous Indian cultures were sedentary and used agriculture. Numerous Indian towns had built surrounding stockades for defense. Capable of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> they and ancestors could have built mounds, but people who believed that the Indians did not build the earthworks did not analyze it in this manner. They thought the Native American nomadic cultures would not organize to build such monuments, for failure to devote the time and effort to construct such time-consuming projects.|$|E
25|$|In 1080 William {{sent his}} eldest son, Robert Curthose, north {{to defend the}} kingdom against the Scots. After his campaign, he moved to Monkchester and began the {{building}} of a 'New Castle'. This was of the “motte-and-bailey” <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> a wooden tower on top of an earthen mound (motte), surrounded by a moat and wooden stockade (bailey). It was this castle that gave Newcastle its name. In 1095 the Earl of Northumbria, Robert de Mowbray, rose up against the king, William Rufus and Rufus sent an army north to recapture the castle. From then on the castle became crown property and was an important base from which the king could control the northern barons. The Northumbrian earldom was abolished and a Sheriff of Northumberland was appointed to administer the region. In 1091 the parish church of St Nicholas was consecrated {{on the site of the}} present Anglican cathedral, close by the bailey of the new castle. The church is believed to have been a wooden building on stone footings.|$|E

25|$|For {{the third}} {{lighthouse}} {{built by the}} Queensland colonial government (Lady Elliot Island Light erected on Lady Elliott's Island in 1872/73), Colonial Architect FDG Stanley designed a structure which utilised readily available local timber, specifying a hardwood frame clad with plated iron sheeting. This reduced the cost of construction, and despite problems of termite infestation and rusting, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> or its derivative, a wooden frame with corrugated galvanised iron sheeting, became the standard for subsequent nineteenth century Queensland lighthouses. Between 1873 and 1901, 14 lighthouses were constructed in Queensland using hardwood framing and plated iron sheeting, and another 7 were constructed with hardwood frames and corrugated iron cladding. The latter were associated mostly with harbour entrances and included: Little Sea Hill Light (1876 – relocated); Grassy Hill Light (1886 – active); Goods Island Light (1886 – active); Bay Rock Light (1886 – inactive – relocated); Caloundra Head Light (1896 – inactive); North Point Hummock Light (1899 – demolished); Gatcombe Head Light (1900 – demolished). An eighth lighthouse of this type, Bulwer Island Light, was constructed at Bulwer Island in the Brisbane River in 1912, but is now inactive has been relocated.|$|E

Framing is cased in the parlor and exposed in the hall, where the summers are adzed and roughly chamfered." [...] The attic construction is conventional with equally spaced rafters that have mortise and tenon joints at the ridge. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> indicates that the conventional principal rafter or purlin framing may not have been used in Ledyard during that time.|$|E
