French Jesuit priest Charlevoix could only conclude [...] "Whether there was some miscalculation in the measures they took or whether it was brought about by design the canoe capsized."

40|$|The {{current study}} {{set out to}} {{replicate}} and expand {{the results of a}} study by Pruss (2007) which found that information is lost when interviews are conducted <b>through</b> <b>interpreters.</b> In <b>the</b> present study, Viewers (i. e., mock eyewitnesses) fluent in Spanish watched a video of a burglary and then were interviewed in Spanish about what they had seen. Half of Viewers were randomly assigned to be interviewed by an English-speaking Interviewer <b>through</b> a bilingual <b>Interpreter</b> (<b>Interpreter</b> condition), and <b>the</b> other half were randomly assigned to be interviewed directly by a Spanish speaking Interviewer with no Interpreter (No Interpreter condition). Within each of these two conditions, half of interviews were conducted following a script of open-ended questions (Scripted condition), and the other half were conducted without a script (Unscripted Condition). The total number of groups was 120 and the total number of participants was 300. Interviews were coded for the amount of information transmitted during the interview. Consistent with the findings of Pruss (2007), the present study found that Interviewers extracted more information when they questioned Viewers directly than when they questioned Viewers <b>through</b> an <b>Interpreter.</b> <b>The</b> open-ended script significantly increased the yield of information when Interviewers questioned Viewers directly, but not when Interpreters were used. More generally, {{the results of this study}} support the use of open-ended questions in investigative interviews and the practice of tape recording such interviews. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine how counselors within youth and sexual health clinics in Stockholm {{experience}} conversations about sensitive issues <b>through</b> <b>interpreters.</b> <b>The</b> study is based on eight qualitative interviews, five with counselors and three with <b>interpreters.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical framework is based on selected concepts from the theory of symbolic interactionism which are the following: definition of the situation, social interaction, symbols, activity and the present. In addition to these concepts we have used to selected models from a communication theory: the barrier model and filter- and noise model. The results of the study show that counselors, in order to have conversations about sensitive issues, needs to be responsive, open. This is a balance between showing the youth that sensitive issues can be spoken of and respecting the youths’ limits. The results also show that the interaction between counselors and interpreters is complex, due to many factors and that most of the counselors experience it as a troublesome but necessary part of their work. The study also reveals a problematic situation caused by lack of knowledge about interpreters’ education, division of responsibilities and the lack of interpreters’, especially with the right education for this context...|$|R

Some of these deviations were helpful, but others were confusing or incorrect. In particular, interpreters were inclined to conduct much of the consultations themselves.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the process of}} formalizing an existing, industrial domain specific language (dsl) {{that is based on}} the taskresource paradigm. Initially, the semantics of this dsl is defined informally and implicitly <b>through</b> an <b>interpreter.</b> <b>The</b> formalization starts by projecting the existing concrete syntax onto a formal abstract syntax that defines the language operators and process terms. Next, we define the dynamic operational semantics at the level of individual syntactical notions, using structural operational semantics (sos) as a formal metalanguage. Here, the impact of the formalization process on the dsl is considered in terms of disambiguation of underlying (semantic) language design decisions. ...|$|R

50|$|D.45.1.16 {{says that}} if the {{question}} is in Latin and the reply is in Greek, the obligation is settled providing the two correspond.

An obligation is only produced where both parties understand each other, but this may be <b>through</b> an <b>interpreter.</b> <b>The</b> last clause suggests that the text may have been interpolated, as the use of an interpreter seems unlikely as it would be highly problematic because the interpretator might lie as to what was being said.|$|R

Anson then explained that the right season for returning to Europe had now arrived, that provisions were ready but he just needed the Viceroy's assent. This was immediately given. No mention was made of the unpaid port fees and Anson believed that a precedent had been set but when the next British warship entered Canton in 1764, it paid normal duties.|$|R
40|$|Medical {{briefings}} between {{physicians and}} their patients {{are intended to}} inform the patient about his disease and ongoing medical treatment {{as well as to}} get the patient's consent (agreement). But what happens in these consultations if the patient does not have an adequate grasp of the language to understand the medical explanation and if the dialogue is translated ad hoc—whether by his relatives or by bilingual hospital employees? How is knowledge transfer and the structure of interaction affected by hearing the physicians' discourse <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpreter?</b> <b>The</b> reviewed linguistic publication follows a discourse analytical approach and examines briefings for informed consent in the hospital, which are translated ad hoc from German into Portuguese. It can be shown that the knowledge transfer for the patient changes, and further, how the communicative order of medical institutional discourse is broken up and thus the quality of consultation for non-German-speaking patients worsens. Following up on the findings of this analysis, the problem of multilingual communication and interaction in the medical field and in other institutional contexts could provide an ongoing research focus on the basis of an interdisciplinary extended discourse analytical perspective.

Friar Valverde presented himself to Atahualpa and explained <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpreter</b> <b>the</b> mysteries of Catholic religion, and that, on account of their heathenism, the pope had granted Atahualpa's kingdom to the Spaniards. Atahualpa professed not to understand the tenor of this discourse, and would not resign his kingdom, saying he would [...] "be no man's tributary." [...] Upon hearing this, the friar gave a Bible to Atahualpa, who, after merely observing it and turning a few pages, threw {{the book on the}} floor. Atahualpa then demanded a full account of the presence of the Spaniards in his land. At this point Pizarro and his forces decided to come out on horseback with firearms, causing many of Atahualpa's army to flee upon hearing the sounds of artillery and arquebus.Many natives died as they tried to fight against the better-armed Spaniards. Thereafter, Pizarro went on to look for Atahualpa himself, who was shielded by his faithful nobles who, in the end, were also captured by the Spaniards.|$|R
