5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of {{religious}} convictions. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Emir,</b> he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), dressed in traditional Afghan robes, and interacted more closely with the border tribes. While <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of the}} Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from <b>the</b> <b>emir.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, {{the three}} are framed and {{arrested by the}} {{authorities}} under various charges. Thomson and Thompson are cleared and released, but Tintin is kidnapped by the Arab insurgent Bab El Ehr, who mistakenly believes that Tintin has informations for him concerning an arms delivery. Tintin escapes and encounters an old enemy, Dr. Müller, sabotaging an oil pipeline. He reunites with Thomson and Thompson during a sandstorm and eventually arrives in Khemed's capital city of Wadesdah. When Tintin narrates the sabotage orchestrated by Müller to <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, one of the Emir's attendants, Ali Ben Mahmud, informs <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> that his son Prince Abdullah is kidnapped. Tintin suspects that Müller is responsible and assures <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> that he would rescue Abdullah.|$|E
5|$|He {{expressed}} {{surprise that}} a task {{as important as}} the expedition's was entrusted to such young men. Von Hentig had to convince <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> that the mission did not consider themselves merchants, but instead brought word from the Kaiser, the Ottoman Sultan, and from India, wishing to recognise Afghanistan's complete independence and sovereignty. The Kaiser's typewritten letter, which he compared to the handsome greeting received from the Ottomans, failed to settle the Emir's suspicions; he doubted its authenticity. Von Hentig's explanation that the Kaiser had written the letter using the only instrument available at his field headquarters before the group's hurried departure may not have entirely convinced him. Passing along the Kaiser's invitation to join the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers, von Hentig described the war situation as favourable and invited <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> to declare independence. This was followed by a presentation from Kasim Bey explaining the Ottoman Sultan's declaration of jihad and Turkey's desire to avoid a fratricidal war between Islamic peoples. He passed along a message to Afghanistan similar to the Kaiser's. Barkatullah invited Habibullah to declare war against the British Empire and to come to the aid of India's Muslims. He proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> should allow Turco-German forces to cross Afghanistan for a campaign towards the Indian frontier, a campaign which he hoped <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> would join. Barkatullah and Mahendra Pratap, both eloquent speakers, pointed out the rich territorial gains <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> stood to acquire by joining the Central Powers.|$|E

5000|$|While Kitbugha was in Damascus <b>the</b> <b>emirs</b> {{decided to}} get rid of him. <b>The</b> <b>emirs</b> went to Kitbugha and met him while {{he was on his way}} to Egypt. Kitbugha was angry with Bisari, who was a {{prominent}} emir, and accused him of corresponding with the Mongols. Fearing that Kitbugha would arrest Bisari, <b>the</b> <b>emirs,</b> [...] including Lajin, carried arms and went to the Dihliz [...] of Kitbugha and clashed with his Mamluks. A few of Kitbugha's Mamluks were killed or injured. Kitbugha left the Dihliz through a back passage and fled to Damascus, accompanied by five of his Mamluks. <b>The</b> <b>emirs</b> were unable to catch him. Lajin was placed on the throne as the new Sultan of Egypt.|$|R
5|$|In Brussels, after a {{night out}} at the cinema, Tintin and Captain Haddock bump into an old acquaintance, General Alcazar. Returning to Marlinspike Hall, they find that another acquaintance, <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> of Khemed, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, has been overthrown by his nemesis Sheikh Bab El Ehr; <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> has {{accordingly}} sent his son, the disobedient and mischievous Abdullah, to stay at Marlinspike for his own protection. The police detectives Thomson and Thompson visit, informing Tintin that Alcazar is seeking to purchase military aircraft from J. M. Dawson.|$|E
5|$|The titular {{head of the}} {{expedition}} was Mahendra Pratap, while von Hentig was the Kaiser's representative. He was to accompany and introduce Mahendra Pratap and {{was responsible for the}} German diplomatic representations to <b>the</b> <b>Emir.</b> To fund the mission, 100,000 pounds sterling in gold was deposited in an account at the Deutsche Bank in Constantinople. The expedition was also provided with gold and other gifts for <b>the</b> <b>Emir,</b> including jewelled watches, gold fountain pens, ornamental rifles, binoculars, cameras, cinema projectors, and an alarm clock.|$|E
5|$|December 1915 {{also saw}} {{concrete}} {{progress on the}} mission's Turco-German objective. <b>The</b> <b>Emir</b> informed von Hentig {{he was ready to}} discuss a treaty of Afghan-German friendship, but said it would take time and require extensive historical research. Work on the treaty began with drafts proposed by von Hentig. The final draft of ten articles presented on 24 January 1916 included clauses recognising Afghan independence, a declaration of friendship with Germany, and establishment of diplomatic relations. Von Hentig was to be accredited the Embassy Secretary of the German Empire. In addition, the treaty would guarantee German assistance against Russian and British threats if Afghanistan joined the war on the Central side. The Emir's army was to be modernised, with Germany providing 100,000 modern rifles, 300 artillery pieces, and other modern warfare equipment. The Germans were to be responsible for maintaining advisors and engineers, and to maintain an overland supply route through Persia for arms and ammunition. Further, <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> was to be paid £1,000,000. Both von Hentig and Niedermayer signed this document which created—as von Hentig argued in a telegram to the Foreign Office—an initial basis to prepare for an Afghan invasion of India. Niedermayer explained that <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> intended to begin his campaign as soon as Germany could make available 20,000 troops to protect the Afghan-Russian front, and asked for urgently for wireless sets, a substantial shipment of arms, and at least a million pounds initial funding. He judged conditions to be ideal for an offensive into India, and informed the general staff to expect the campaign to begin in April.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the course}} of the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>emirs</b> had slowly gained {{effective}} control of the Khanate of Bukhara, from their position as ataliq; and by the 1740s, when the khanate was conquered by Nadir Shah of Persia, it was clear that <b>the</b> <b>emirs</b> held <b>the</b> real power. In 1747, after Nadir Shah's death, the ataliq Muhammad Rahim Bi murdered Abulfayz Khan and his son, ending the Janid dynasty. From then on <b>the</b> <b>emirs</b> allowed puppet khans to rule until, following the death of Abu l-Ghazi Khan, Shah Murad assumed the throne openly.|$|R

5|$|The Emir's {{reply was}} shrewd but frank. He noted Afghanistan's {{vulnerable}} strategic position {{between the two}} allied nations of Russia and Britain, and the difficulties of any possible Turco-German assistance to Afghanistan, especially given {{the presence of the}} Anglo-Russian East Persian Cordon. Further, he was financially vulnerable, dependent on British subsidies and institutions for his fortune and the financial welfare of his army and kingdom. The members of the mission had no immediate answers to his questions regarding strategic assistance, arms, and funds. Merely tasked to entreat <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> to join a holy war, they did not have the authority to promise anything. Nonetheless, they expressed hopes of an alliance with Persia in the near future (a task Prince Henry of Reuss and Wilhelm Wassmuss worked on), which would help meet the Emir's needs. Although it reached no firm outcome, this first meeting has been noted by historians as being cordial, helping open communications with <b>the</b> <b>Emir</b> and allowing the mission to hope for success.|$|E

5|$|Congregational {{prayers were}} {{reestablished}} at al-Azhar during the Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266. While Shāfi‘ī teachings, which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed, stipulated {{that only one}} mosque should {{be used as a}} congregational mosque in a community, the Hanafi madh'hab, to which the Mamluks adhered, placed no such restriction. Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers, as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque, which had been neglected for nearly 100 years. According to al-Mufaddal, <b>the</b> <b>emir</b> 'Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Hilli built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque. Al-Maqrizi reports that <b>the</b> <b>emir</b> repaired the walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats. The first khutbah since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim took place on January 16, 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier.|$|E

In retrospect, these successes proved decisive, as the battle permanently destroyed the power of Melitene.
