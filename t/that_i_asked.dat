25|$|It {{has been}} said by some <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of {{leadership}} would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration {{would have been in}} not struggling for something better. Today, I am not ashamed..... The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain things are no longer acceptable to us as a people.|$|E
25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{the parents}} of Seattle University president Stephen Sundborg (and former 26-year residents of Alaska) George and Mary Sundborg donated $1million to the Seattle University School of Law Alaska Fund, a scholarship for Alaskan law students. Addressing the donation, to a school [...] southeast of Alaska, the president noted that Alaska was the only state without a law school: [...] "As an Alaskan myself, I seek as president of Seattle University to develop this educational service to Alaska in many ways. It was because of this commitment {{and in order to}} begin this broader initiative <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> my own parents for the initial gift to the Alaska Fund." [...] The elder Sundborg (one of the 55 signers of the Alaska State Constitution, a copy of which was displayed at Seattle University {{at the time of the}} donation) was an editor of newspapers in Juneau and Fairbanks, general manager of the Alaska Development Board and assistant to Governor and United States Senator Ernest Gruening. That year, Seattle University devoted a school-library room to Alaskan law [...] "to better serve the legal community in Alaska" [...] and bid (unsuccessfully) to publish the Alaska Law Review.|$|E

2500|$|After the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, {{performances}} by the Boston Symphony Orchestra of excerpts from Klinghoffer were canceled. BSO Managing Director Mark Volpe remarked of the decision: [...] "We originally programmed the choruses from John Adams’ The Death of Klinghoffer {{because we believe}} in it {{as a work of}} art, and we still hold that conviction. ... explained that it was a purely human reason, and that it wasn’t in the least bit a criticism of the work." [...] Adams and Klinghoffer librettist Alice Goodman criticized the decision, and Adams rejected a request to substitute a performance of Harmonium, saying: [...] "The reason <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> them not to do 'Harmonium' was that I felt that 'Klinghoffer' is a serious and humane work, and it's also a work about which many people have made prejudicial judgments without even hearing it. I felt that if I said, 'OK, [...] "Klinghoffer" [...] is too hot to handle, do [...] "Harmonium,"' that in a sense I would be agreeing with the judgment about 'Klinghoffer.'" [...] In response to an article by San Francisco Chronicle David Wiegand denouncing the BSO decision, musicologist and critic Richard Taruskin accused the work of catering to [...] "anti-American, anti-Semitic and anti-bourgeois" [...] prejudices.|$|E
60|$|Ada {{looked so}} very anxious now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Mrs. Badger {{on what she}} founded her supposition.|$|E

60|$|At {{night we}} two sisters {{shared the same}} room, {{and then it was}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Nan to tell me what was in her heart.|$|E

6000|$|And the Water-midden gazed sorrowfully {{into his}} face. [...] "That is all <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> Mulla-mulgar," [...] she {{repeated}} softly--"that {{you will not}} forget me.

6000|$|... "But it is {{not merely}} for the {{pleasure}} of your society <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you. <b>I</b> have a word to say to you which may be important. Yours faithfully, ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It was {{not with}} {{anything}} of the kind in my mind <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the question. Perhaps I wondered if you'd had the experience that'll be needed before your work is done." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{there were}} no further {{witnesses}} for the prosecution I cross-examined these two at full length, but absolutely without results, since every vital question <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> was met with a direct negative.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in no}} {{disposition}} for Uriah's company, but in {{remembrance of}} the entreaty Agnes had made to me, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him if he would}} come home to my rooms, and have some coffee.|$|E

60|$|It touches me to {{read what}} you write of your poor mother. But, of course, at her age, each winter counts heavily. Do give her my love, and tell her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you about her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to meet}} me, and didn't call," [...] began Jude with the bashfulness of a lover. [...] "But I thought it would save time {{if we were going}} to walk." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Gareth said: [...] "Lord, this is {{the first}} boon <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would <b>ask</b> of thee. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> not for knighthood nor for courtly favor.

60|$|This talk {{took place}} {{while we were}} still {{awaiting}} Jamie's coming. He had only been with us one day when Jess made a terrible discovery. She was looking so mournful when I saw her, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Leeby what was wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the long}} and the short of it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him round here to Maroni's to dinner; and before we broke up for the night we had settled the {{financial}} side of the plan that's brought you to New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{you to let}} me {{help you}} carry out your plan of life, and to save all you have done, and all you have hoped, from waste--as your husband. Think"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It takes two," [...] he said, [...] "to quarrel. I {{shall not}} quarrel with you. All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> from {{you is a}} {{realization}} {{of the fact that}} we are engaged to be married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{is but one}} thing, Captain,' I {{broke in}} eagerly. 'It is as much, or more, for your own sake than mine <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> it. Do not allow this unhappy man to be murdered.' ...|$|R
