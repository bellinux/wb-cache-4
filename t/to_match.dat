5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score <b>to</b> <b>match</b> {{the key of}} the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat <b>to</b> <b>match</b> his intended key.|$|E

5|$|As a {{free agent}} {{during the summer of}} 1997, Joe Sakic signed a three-year, $21million offer sheet with the New York Rangers. Under the {{collective}} bargaining agreement at the time, the Avalanche had one week <b>to</b> <b>match</b> the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for NHL players.|$|E
5|$|At the time, many Japanese politicians, {{including}} Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (who was {{an outspoken}} critic of an alliance with Nazi Germany), were shocked by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Nevertheless, the leaders of the military clique then in control in Tokyo concluded that it was a ruse designed to buy the Nazis time <b>to</b> <b>match</b> the British navy.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s it {{was clear}} that France was unable <b>to</b> <b>match</b> British {{building}} of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. The result was the first ocean-going ironclad, , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.|$|E

5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>match</b> {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed <b>to</b> <b>match</b> the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made <b>to</b> <b>match</b> a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest {{to the type of}} wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts <b>to</b> <b>match</b> a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
