40|$|Persons {{suffering}} {{central nervous}} system damage, such as a stroke, coma patients, or individuals that have suffered damage to the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and motor cortex, sometimes develop an asymmetric walking pattern where one leg does not fully swing backward. This uneven gait hinders these individuals in properly and efficiently moving through everyday life. Previous research in humans and various animals has introduced a split <b>belt</b> <b>treadmill</b> to analyze possible rehabilitation, which can recreate a correct gait pattern by altering the speed of each track. Gait adaptation was achieved by having the split <b>belt</b> <b>treadmill</b> move each leg at a different velocity relative {{to the ground and}} thus forcing a symmetric gait. Test subjects‟ gait would adapt to the speeds and a normal gait pattern could be conditioned while on the split <b>belt</b> <b>treadmill.</b> However, after short trials, individuals were unable to neurologically store these feed-forward walking patterns once walking over ground. Also, test subjects would have difficulty adapting their learned walking gait over different walking environments. The gait enhancing mobile shoe (GEMS) makes it possible to adjust an asymmetric walking gait so that both legs move at a relatively symmetric speed over ground. It alters the wearers walking gait by forcing each foot backwards during the stance phase, operating solely by mechanical motion, transferring the wearer‟s downward force into a horizontal backwards motion. Recreating the split <b>belt</b> <b>treadmill</b> effect over ground by using the GEMS will potentially enable me to test the long term effects of a corrected gait, which is impossible using a split <b>belt</b> <b>treadmill.</b> A previous prototype of the GEMS [1] successfully generated a split <b>belt</b> <b>treadmill</b> walking pattern, but had various drawbacks, such as variable motion from step to step. My new design of this rehabilitation shoe promises to alter the user‟s gait as a split <b>belt</b> <b>treadmill</b> does, and to be mechanically stable operating without any external power sources. I designed and constructed a new motion controlled gait enhancing mobile shoe that improves the previous version‟s drawbacks. While mimicking the asymmetric gait motion experienced on a split-belt treadmill, this version of the GEMS has motion that is continuous, smooth, and regulated with on-board electronics. An interesting aspect of this new design is the Archimedean spiral wheel shape that redirects the wearer‟s downward force into a horizontal backward motion. The design is passive and does not utilize any motors and actuators. Its motion is only regulated by a small magnetic pthesis brake. Initial tests show the shoe operates as desired, but further experimentation is needed to evaluate the long-term after-effects...|$|R

40|$|Background: Body weight-supported {{treadmill}} training (BWSTT) {{is being}} investigated {{as an adjunct to}} conventional gait training for the treatment of hemiparetic stroke patients. The potential efficacy of the technique may, in part, be related to optimiz-ing locomotor-related sensory inputs to the nervous system, which in turn may improve the timing and coordination of motor activity. Objectives and Methods: This pilot study evaluated the effects of varying two types of sensory inputs, limb load and <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt</b> speed, during BWSTT. We assessed the effects of three levels of body weight sup-port (BWS) and three treadmill speeds on the single limb stance time ratio (SLSR) and the single limb loading ratio (SLLR) in four subacute hemiparetic stroke patients. In three additional subjects, we studied the effects on SLSR of changing only the level of BWS at the one treadmill speed equal to best overground speed. Results: In comparison to overground walking, treadmill walking increased the SLSR toward 1. 0. Higher belt speeds generally did not alter this increase in symmetry. A significant rela-tionship was also found between SLLR and BWS. Fifteen percent BWS was most often associated with a SLLR close to 1. 0, independent of the treadmill speed. Conclusion: During BWSTT, the moving <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt</b> entrains greater symmetry of single limb stance time in hemiparetic subjects who otherwise step asymmetrically. Optimal limb loading and treadmill speeds can increase the symmetry of stepping-associated sen-sory inputs, which may enhance the locomotor output derived from activity-depen-dent plasticity.

We used split-belt walking to probe motor adaptation (a form of motor learning) in children. Data from 27 children (ages 8 – 36 mo) were compared with those from 10 adults. Children walked with the <b>treadmill</b> <b>belts</b> {{at the same speed}} (tied belt), followed by walking with the belts moving at different speeds (split belt) for 8 – 10 min, followed again by tied-belt walking (postsplit). Initial asymmetries in temporal coordination (i. e., double support time) induced by split-belt walking were slowly reduced, with most children showing an aftereffect (i. e., asymmetry in the opposite direction to the initial) in the early postsplit period, indicative of learning. In contrast, asymmetries in spatial coordination (i. e., center of oscillation) persisted during split-belt walking and no aftereffect was seen. Step length, a measure of both spatial and temporal coordination, showed intermediate effects. The time course of learning in double support and step length was slower in children than in adults. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between the size of the initial asymmetry during early split-belt walking (called error) and the aftereffect for step length. Hence, children may have more difficulty learning when the errors are large. The findings further suggest that the mechanisms controlling temporal and spatial adaptation are different and mature at different times...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{circuitry}} of the lumbar {{spinal cord}} can generate alternating extension and flexion of the hindlimbs. The hindlimbs of adult cats with complete transection of {{the spinal cord}} at a low thoracic level (T 12 -T 13) can perform full weight-supporting locomotion on a <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt</b> moving at a range of speeds. Some limitations in the locomotor capacity {{can be associated with}} a deficit in the recruitment level of the fast extensors during the stance phase and the flexors during the swing phase of a step cycle. The level of locomotor performance, however, can be enhanced by daily training on a treadmill while emphasizing full weight-support stepping and by providing appropriately timed sensory stimulation, loading, and/or pharmacologic stimulation of the hindlimb neuromuscular apparatus. Furthermore, there appears to be an interactive effect of these interventions. For example, the maximum treadmill speed that a spinal adult cat can attain and maintain is significantly improved with daily full weight-supporting treadmill training, but progressive recruitment of fast extensors becomes apparent only when the hindlimbs are loaded by gently pulling down on the tail during the stepping. Stimulation of the sural nerve at the initiation of the flexion phase of the step cycle can likewise markedly improve the locomotor capability. Administration of clonidine, in particular in combination with an elevated load, resulted in the most distinct and consistent alternating bursts of electromyographic activity during spinal stepping. These data indicate that the spinal cord has the ability to execute alternating activation of the extensor and flexor musculature of the hindlimbs (stepping) and that this ability can be improved by several interventions such as training, sensory stimulation, and use of some pharmacologic agents. Thus, it appears that the spinal cord, without supraspinal input, is highly plastic and has the potential to "learn," that is, to acquire and improve its ability to execute full weight-supporting locomotion on a <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt...</b>|$|E
40|$|Stepping {{responses}} were studied in infants {{between the ages}} of 10 days and 10 months while they were supported to step on a slowly moving <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt.</b> Surface electromyography (EMG) from muscles in the lower limb, force exerted by the feet on the <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt,</b> and the motion of the lower limbs were recorded. Two groups of infants were studied, those who had a small amount of daily practice in stepping and those who did not. Practice resulted in a dramatic increase in the incidence of stepping recorded in the laboratory, particularly for the periods between 1 and 6 months of age. The majority of infants showed clear alternation between the flexor and extensor muscles during walking, regardless of age. Co-contraction between flexors and extensors, estimated by the overlap in area between rectified and smoothed EMG from a muscle pair, was greater for some muscle groups in the infant compared with the adult. Practice resulted in a significantly lower co-contraction index for the tibialis anterior- quadriceps muscle pair. Practice did not affect the mean step cycle duration. Infants of all ages could step at a range of treadmill speeds by adjusting their step cycle duration. The relationship between the treadmill speed and cycle duration was well fitted by a power function, similar to those reported for intact cats and adult humans. The change in step cycle duration resulted almost entirely from a change in the extensor burst duration, whereas the flexor burst duration remained constant. Airstepping could be elicited in some infants. The cycle durations for airstepping were close to the shortest cycles recorded on the treadmill. In conclusion, the system for generating rhythmic, alternating activity of the lower limbs for stepping is clearly developed by birth. The stepping is sustained and regular, particularly if stepping practice is incorporated briefly each day. The infant population provides a good subject pool for studying the afferent control of walking in the human, before cerebral influences are fully developed. The characteristics and maturity of the system remain to be determined...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} based {{study of}} a completely new form of body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) technique which is fully passive in nature is presented in this paper.

The hip extension pertaining to the stance phase of the gait cycle is achieved through the stance foot being literally dragged by the <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt</b> while the required manoeuvring of the trunk is expected to be accomplished by the voluntary arm-support from the subject. The swing phase, on the other hand, is initiated through appropriately coupling the swing knee with the contralateral extending hip and eventually achieve full knee extension through switching the treadmill speed to a lower value.

40|$|Background: Gait {{analysis}} {{is used to}} measure objectively the ability to walk before and after hip and knee joint replacement. Most gait literature to date has measured patients walking at slow speeds, which may have unintentionally characterized successful lower limb operations as the same regardless of its operation type. The aim of this thesis was to use an instrumented treadmill to (1) test the upper limits of gait performance of patients awaiting and after lower limb arthroplasty and (2) describe and compare different joint procedures to healthy controls. Method: Gait analysis was carried out using an instrumented treadmill. Study participants walked at their preferred walking and top walking speed on the treadmill. Their vertical ground reaction force and spatiotemporal data was captured for both limbs by tandem force plates beneath the <b>treadmill’s</b> <b>belt.</b> Results: The results suggest that at preferred walking speed on the flat, all subjects’ gait characteristics were similar irrespective of joint state. The differences between patient groups became more apparent at top walking speed. Weight acceptance, step length and stride length were the most useful variables assessing these differences. Unicompartmental knee replacement and hip resurfacing had closer to normal gait patterns when compared to total knee replacement and conventional total hip replacement respectively. Predictably patients with knee osteoarthritis had asymmetrical gait patterns, impulse {{was found to be}} the best variable distinguishing patients with knee osteoarthritis from healthy controls. The downhill walking assessment established that patients with unicompartmental knee replacements had a more normal gait pattern than total knee replacement patients. Conclusion: The gait results suggest that an instrumented treadmill is a useful metric to describe patient gait patterns. Testing performance at higher walking speeds allowed differences to be detected, which were undetectable at slower speeds. Anatomically conserving procedures such as unicompartmental knee replacement and hip resurfacing appear to have convincing functional advantages compared to less conserving joint replacement procedures.

50|$|Treadmill training, with {{or without}} a body-weight support, is an {{emerging}} therapy and is being used with stroke patients to improve kinematic gait parameters. These patients often present with significant gait deviations and body weight-supported treadmill training can provide an intense repetitive practice of a more natural gait pattern. Literature continues to emerge examining the influence treadmill speed may have on the improvement of gait patterns and functional independence. Research has shown that a greater gain in independent walking ability is seen in hemiparetic stroke patients who participate in structured speed-dependent treadmill training compared to conventional training. Improvements in gait parameters included walking speed, cadence, stride length and Functional Ambulation Category scores. In speed-dependent <b>treadmill</b> training, <b>belt</b> speed is increased to the maximum-achievable speed the patient can maintain for 10 seconds without stumbling, followed by a period of recovery.

40|$|International audienceInfluence {{of walking}} on {{swimmeret}} beating in intact lobsters, Homarus gammarus, has been analyzed using a <b>treadmill</b> experimental device. <b>Belt</b> movement activates both leg stepping and swimmeret beating.

The main characteristics of the swimmeret beating as defined by Davis (1969) has been observed here in sequences without walking. However during long walking sequences a very different swimmeret beating pattern occurs.

In more rapid swimmeret beating a relative coordination with leg stepping is very common. The functional meaning of this linkage between legs and swimmerets is discussed...|$|R

The robot produced stable walking on the splitbelt <b>treadmill</b> at various <b>belt</b> speeds without changing the control strategy and parameters, despite a large discrepancy between the belt speeds. This is due to modulation of the locomotor rhythm and its phase through the phase resetting mechanism, which induces the relative phase between leg movements to shift from antiphase, and causes the duty factors to be autonomously modulated depending on the speed discrepancy between the belts. Such shifts of the relative phase and modulations of the duty factors are observed during human splitbelt treadmill walking.

40|$|Treadmill walking aims to {{simulate}} overground walking, but intra-stride belt speed variations of treadmills result in some interaction between treadmill and subject, possibly obstructing this aim. Especially in self-paced treadmill walking, {{in which the}} belt speed constantly adjusts to the subject, these interactions might affect the gait pattern significantly. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the energy exchange between subject and treadmill, during the fixed speed (FS) and self-paced (SP) modes of treadmill walking. Eighteen subjects walked on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill at both modes. The energy exchange was calculated as the integration of the product of the belt speed deviation and the fore-aft ground reaction force over the stride cycle. The total positive energy exchange was 0. 44. J/stride and the negative exchange was 0. 11. J/stride, which was both less than 1. 6 % of the performed work on the center of mass. Energy was mainly exchanged from subject to treadmill during both the braking and propulsive phase of gait. The two treadmill modes showed a similar pattern of energy exchange, with a slightly increased energy exchange during the braking phase of SP walking.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) {{patients}} {{have an increased}} gait asymmetry and variability, which is most pronounced in patients with freezing of gait (FOG). We examined if stride time variability and deficits in interlimb coordination between {{the upper and lower}} limbs would increase during split-belt locomotion in PD, and particularly so in patients with FOG. METHODS: Fourteen PD patients (seven with FOG, matched for disease severity with the seven non-freezers) and 10 healthy controls walked on a <b>treadmill</b> with split <b>belts</b> at different speeds (2 versus 3 km/h). Gait was recorded by means of a video motion analysis system. Outcome measures were stride length asymmetry and variability, stride time asymmetry and variability, ipsilateral and contralateral interlimb coordination, and phase coordination index. RESULTS: Both PD subjects and controls were able to adapt to split-belt walking by modulating their stride length. However, freezers showed a larger increase in stride time asymmetry and stride time variability due to split-belt walking compared to non-freezers. Furthermore, contralateral interlimb coordination improved in control subjects during split-belt walking, but not in PD patients (freezers and non-freezers). Phase coordination index did not change differently across the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to walk under split-belt conditions was preserved in PD. Non-freezers and controls compensated for the experimentally increased stride length asymmetry by decreasing their stride time asymmetry. This ability was lost in freezers, who in fact increased their stride time asymmetry during split-belt walking. As a result, stride time variability also increased in freezers. These findings support the hypothesis that FOG is related to gait asymmetries and to gait timing deficits...|$|R
40|$|Human interlimb {{coordination}} and the adaptations in leg muscle activity were studied during {{walking on a}} <b>treadmill</b> with split <b>belts.</b> Four different belt speeds (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 m/s) were offered in all possible combinations for {{the left and right}} leg. Subjects adapted automatically to a difference in belt speed within 10 – 20 stride cycles. This adaptation was achieved by a reorganization of the stride cycle with a relative shortening of the duration of the support and lengthening of the swing phase of the “fast” leg and, vice versa, in support and swing duration on the “slow” leg. The electromyogram EMG patterns were characterized by two basic observations: (1) onset and timing of EMG activity were influenced by biomechanical constraints. A shortening of the support phase on the faster side was related to an earlier onset and increase in gastrocnemius activity, while a coactivation pattern in the antagonistic leg muscles was predominant during a prolonged support phase on the slower side. (2) A differential modulation of the antagonistic leg muscles took place. An increase in ipsilateral belt speed in combination with a constant contralateral belt speed was associated with an almost linear increase in ipsilateral gastrocnemius and contralateral tibialis anterior EMG activity, while the contralateral gastrocnemius and ipsilateral tibialis anterior EMG activity were little affected. It is concluded that a modifiable timing within the stride cycle takes place with a coupling between ipsilateral support and contralateral swing phase. The neuronal control of this coupling is obviously based on ipsilateral modulation of leg extensor EMG by proprioceptive feedback and an appropriate central (e. g. spinal) modulation of contralateral tibialis anterior EMG activity...|$|R

A custom-written threshold determination program was used to display Landolt C optotypes on a laptop computer screen during a "far" (4 m) target condition and on a micro-display for a "near" (50 cm) target condition. The walking acuity scores for each target distance were normalized by subtracting a corresponding acuity measure obtained while standing still on the <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt.</b> RESULTS: As predicted by subjective reports of relative target motion, the decrease in visual acuity was significantly greater (p < 0. 00001) for the near compared to the far condition...|$|E
40|$|Vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, must {{maximize}} their feeding cycle of one blood meal per day by being efficient in the stalking and acquisition of their food. Riskin and Hermanson documented the running gait {{of the common}} vampire bat and observed they were efficient at running speeds, using longer stride lengths and thus decreased stride frequency. We obtained preliminary data on gait maintained for up to 10 minutes on a moving <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt</b> at speeds ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 74 m/s, which spanned a range from walking to running gaits. Bats tended to transition between gaits at about 0. 40 m/s. Fourteen bats were studied and included four that were able to walk or run for 10 minutes. There was no significant change in either stride duration or frequency associated {{with an increase in}} speed. We estimated O 2 consumption and CO 2 production both before and 5 minutes after exercise, and found that O 2 consumption increased 1 minute and 5 minutes after exercise. CO 2 levels increased significantly 1 minute after exercise, but tended back towards pre-exercise level 5 minutes after exercise. Two bats were tested for blood O 2, CO 2 and pH levels. Interestingly, pH levels fell from 7. 3 to about 7. 0, indicating lactate accumulation...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method of}} optimal {{spectral}} tracking is presented which permits the characterisation of trial-varying parameters. Many experimental studies {{suffer from the}} limitations of available analysis methodologies, which often impose a condition of stationarity. This severely limits our ability to track slow varying or dynamic responses with any statistical certainty. Presented is a complete framework for the non-stationary analysis of trial-varying data. Theory is introduced and developed in the characterisation of speed dependent neural modulation of the locomotor drive to tibialis anterior (TA) during healthy treadmill locomotion. The approach adopts adaptive filter theory while retaining a spectral focus, thus remaining compatible {{with much of the}} current literature. Spectral tracking procedures are evaluated using both surrogate and neurophysiological time-series. Confidence intervals are derived in both empiric and numerical form. Analysis of the pre-synaptic drive to TA under the modulation of <b>treadmill</b> <b>belt</b> speed follows, with results demonstrating clear speed dependent influences on the spectral content of TA, suggesting dynamic neural modulation of the locomotor drive. Findings include speed-modulated components at 7 - 12 Hz (early swing) and 15 - 20 Hz (pre-stance). Speed invariant components were identified at 8 - 15 and 15 - 20 Hz during early and late swing, in agreement with previous studies. Modification to the method permits a sub-optimal alternative, encouraging the exploration of short epoched data...|$|E
40|$|During walking, the {{vestibular}} {{influence on}} locomotor activity is phase-dependent and modulated in both limbs {{with changes in}} velocity. It is unclear, however, whether this bilateral modulation {{is due to a}} coordinated mechanism between both limbs or instead through limb-specific processes that remain masked by the symmetric nature of locomotion. Here, human subjects walked on a split-belt <b>treadmill</b> with one <b>belt</b> moving at 0. 4 m s− 1 and the other moving at 0. 8 m s− 1 while exposed to an electrical vestibular stimulus. Muscle activity was recorded bilaterally around the ankles of each limb and used to compare vestibulo-muscular coupling between velocity-matched and unmatched tied-belt walking. In general, response magnitudes decreased by ∼ 20 – 50 % and occurred ∼ 13 – 20 % earlier in the stride cycle at the higher belt velocity. This velocity-dependent modulation of vestibular-evoked muscle activity was retained during split-belt walking and was similar within each limb to velocity-matched tied-belt walking. These results demonstrate that the vestibular influence on ankle muscles during locomotion can be adapted independently to each limb. Furthermore, modulation of vestibular-evoked muscle responses occurred rapidly (∼ 13 – 34 strides) after onset of split-belt walking. This rapid adaptation contrasted the prolonged adaptation in step length symmetry (∼ 128 strides) as well as EMG magnitude and timing (∼ 40 – 100 and ∼ 20 – 80 strides, respectively). These results suggest that vestibular influence on ankle muscle control is adjusted rapidly in sensorimotor control loops as opposed to longer-term error correction mechanisms commonly associated split-belt adaptation. Rapid limb-specific sensorimotor feedback adaptation may be advantageous for asymmetric overground locomotion, such as navigating irregular terrain or turning.

40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar em equino a influência do exercício progressivo e intenso realizado em esteira de alta velocidade sobre a temperatura de regiões da pele, incluindo face, pescoço e quartela, e do casco, incluindo coroa, parede e sola. Utilizaram-se cinco equinos Puro Sangue Árabes, desferrados, com idade média de 8 ± 0, 7 anos, sendo duas fêmeas e três machos, com peso corpóreo médio de 420 ± 10 kg. A intensidade de esforço foi determinada por meio da quantificação do lactato sanguíneo. As temperaturas foram determinadas com o auxílio de termógrafo, antes, durante e após o exercício. Realizou-se análise de variância seguida pelo teste de Tukey, sendo P&# 8804; 0, 05. A lactacidemia aumentou, principalmente nas velocidades intensas. Houve redução das temperaturas das regiões da face, pescoço e quartela após o exercício e diminuição das temperaturas da parede, coroa e sola do casco durante o exercício, enquanto a temperatura da manta de rolamento da esteira não se alterou em nenhum momento. Constatou-se indiretamente que a perfusão sanguínea do casco diminuiu durante o teste de esforço tanto em sua fase aeróbia como na anaeróbia. Nenhuma das intensidades de esforço foi capaz de alterar a temperatura da manta de rolamento da esteira. A temperatura do casco diminuída como decorrência fisiológica do esforço físico imposto, retornou aos valores normais após o término do exercício. The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the influence of intense and progressive exercise performed on a high speed treadmill on the temperature of the skin of the face, neck, pastern, and hoof, including the crown, sole and wall. Five unshod Arabian horses were used, with a mean age of 8 ± 0. 7 years, two females and three males, average body weight of 420 ± 10 kg. The exercise intensity was determined by quantification of blood lactate concentrations. Temperatures were determined with thermography before, during and after exercise. The effect of exercise on the temperature of the anatomic structures studied was evaluated by ANOVA for repeated measures followed by Tukey test, with P&# 8804; 0. 05. Blood lactate increased, especially at more intense speeds. There were decreases in temperature of the regions of the face, neck and pastern after the exercise, of the wall, crown and sole of the hoof during the effort. The temperature of the moving belt blanket bearing did not change at any time throughout the test exercise. It was found, indirectly, that the blood perfusion in the hoof decreased both during the aerobic and anaerobic phase of the exercise test. None of the effort intensities was able to change the temperature of <b>treadmill</b> moving <b>belt.</b> The temperature of the hoof reduced as a physiologic consequence of the exercise and returned to normal values after the end of the test...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Normal walking {{requires}} constant {{adaptation to}} varying circumstances to ascertain stable gait. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FoG) {{are known to}} experience impairments in gait rhythmicity, symmetry, and bilateral coordination within and between both legs. In particular, freezers (FRs) {{were found to have}} increased difficulties with gait adaptation during prolonged split-belt walking and re-adaptation to tied-belt walking, resulting in gait asymmetry. In the current study, it was investigated whether these gait problems are related to perceptual deficits of gait asymmetry in FRs. METHODS: Thirteen FRs, 12 non-freezers (NFs) and 12 healthy controls (HC), matched for age and disease severity, were investigated during walking on a split-belt <b>treadmill.</b> Both <b>belts</b> started at an equal speed of 3. 0 km/h and after a random time interval, the speed of one of the belts was gradually increased with 0. 01 km/h per second. Participants had to indicate by pressing a response button at which moment they perceived belt speeds to be different. We calculated the perception accuracy (the percentage of correct responses) and the perception threshold of locomotor asymmetry (the difference between split-belt speeds at the moment of detection). In addition, spatio-temporal gait characteristics during both split- and tied-belt walking were determined. Each patient performed 8 trials, including 3 practice trials, 5 test trials in which the left or the right belt accelerated, and a sham trial in which none of the belts accelerated. Trials were presented in random order. A one-minute walk with belts at equal speed was provided between all trials to wash out potential adaptation effects. RESULTS: Perception accuracy significantly differed between groups (p= 0. 029). Post-hoc tests revealed that FRs had poorer perception accuracy than NF (p= 0. 024) and HC (p= 0. 020). Impaired perception was mostly present for trials in which belt speed on the disease non-dominant side increased (p= 0. 007). Remarkably, FRs tended to have more incorrect responses in the sham trial (÷²= 0. 059), although no actual change in belt speeds occurred. Average perception threshold did not differ between groups (p= 0. 328). During tied-belt walking, post-hoc tests revealed that FR exhibited more asymmetrical step lengths than HC (p= 0. 034). Step length asymmetry was significantly correlated with the total number of incorrect trials (p= 0. 008, r= 0. 407). CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of the present study}} support the hypothesis that FRs have more impaired perception of locomotor asymmetry than NFs. In addition, FRs seemed to have an exaggerated response in anticipation of salient stimuli, which may signify a compensatory mechanism. The perceptional deficit may lead to altered gait adaptation abilities. Our findings give rise to developing novel rehabilitation methods, addressing perceptual abilities in patients with FoG. status: publishe...|$|R
