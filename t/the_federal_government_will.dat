25|$|Miller stated at a {{town hall}} meeting that he {{believed}} East Germany was an example of a nation taking effective measures to control the flow of people across a border. Miller believes illegal immigration is a “critically important” issue to deal with because of its economic effects on health care, education and employment. Miller wants to secure the border to stop more immigrants from entering America illegally and protect the country from possible terrorist threats. Miller does not believe the millions of immigrants already here illegally should be granted amnesty.

25|$|Oil sands {{operations}} {{differ from}} conventional oil {{in that the}} initial profitability is somewhat lower, but the geological and political risks are low, the reserves are vast, and the expected lifetime of production extends for generations rather than just a few years. Governments {{have an incentive to}} subsidize the start-up costs since they will recover their initial subsidies from tax revenues {{over a long period of}} time. From the standpoint of federal-provincial revenues, they also differ in that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> receive larger higher share and higher return on its incentives than it would from conventional oil, while the provincial share, although substantial, will be proportionally smaller. Consequently, there has tended to be much less intergovernmental conflict and more agreement on how these projects should be handled.|$|E
25|$|On November 25, 2008, a {{new federal}} rule was passed that allows states to charge {{premiums}} and higher co-payments to Medicaid participants. This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, limiting financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> save nearly $1.4 billion. However, {{this means that the}} burden of financial responsibility will be placed on 13 million Medicaid recipients who will face a $1.3 billion increase in co-payments over 5 years. The major concern is that this rule will create a disincentive for low-income people to seek healthcare. It is possible that this will force only the sickest participants to pay the increased premiums and it is unclear what long-term effect this will have on the program.|$|E
25|$|Mandatory {{spending}} {{is expected to}} continue increasing as a share of GDP. This {{is due in part to}} demographic trends, as the number of workers continues declining relative to those receiving benefits. For example, the number of workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960; this declined to 3.0 in 2010 and is projected to decline to 2.2 by 2030. These programs are also affected by per-person costs, which are also expected to increase at a rate significantly higher than economic growth. This unfavorable combination of demographics and per-capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century. Unless these long-term fiscal imbalances are addressed by reforms to these programs, raising taxes or drastic cuts in discretionary programs, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> at some point be unable to pay its obligations without significant risk to the value of the dollar (inflation). By one estimate, 70% of the growth in these entitlement expenses over the 2016-2046 period is due to healthcare.|$|E

500|$|Brunner {{has spoken}} out against {{election}} officials taking voting machines {{home with them}} in the days before an election. [...] Such actions could allow hacking even though it makes transport and delivery to the eventual polling place simpler. [...] Some elections officials say they feel the system is better if elections officials keep an eye on machines the days before the elections. [...] Brunner says poll workers have sometimes cast ballots on machines in their homes. [...] She issued the following directive on the matter: [...] "We want Ohio’s voters {{and the rest of the}} nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment, ballots and supplies. That begins with security practices at boards of elections and polling places, documented chain of custody, and now procedures to make secure voting machine delivery."

[...] On being told that the dies, per the legislation, would be at the Association's expense, Harding replied, [...] "I did not notice that. Then, it essentially costs the Government nothing whatever to render this mark of tribute and assistance." [...] The committee reported the bill favorably on January 18, amending the bill to allow for the 100,000 gold dollars, to be purchased by the Association at par and sold at a profit to help build the memorial. The report indicated that the committee members [...] "believe it is a deserved testimonial to the worth and service of a great man who lost his life while serving our Nation as its Chief Executive". The bill passed the House on February 7, 1916, and the Senate on February 15. It was enacted when President Woodrow Wilson signed it on February 23, 1916.|$|E
500|$|Section 5 {{requires}} that covered jurisdictions receive federal approval, known as [...] "preclearance", before implementing changes to their election laws. A covered jurisdiction has {{the burden of}} proving that the change {{does not have the}} purpose or effect of discriminating {{on the basis of race}} or language minority status; if the jurisdiction fails to meet this burden, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> deny preclearance and the jurisdiction's change will not go into effect. The Supreme Court broadly interpreted Section 5's scope in Allen v. State Board of Election (1969), holding that any change in a jurisdiction's voting practices, even if minor, must be submitted for preclearance. The Court also held that if a jurisdiction fails to have its voting change precleared, private plaintiffs may sue the jurisdiction in the plaintiff's local district court before a three-judge panel. In these Section 5 [...] "enforcement actions", a court considers whether the jurisdiction made a covered voting change, and if so, whether the change has been precleared. If the jurisdiction improperly failed to obtain preclearance, then the court will order the jurisdiction to obtain preclearance before implementing the change. However, the court may not consider the merits of whether the change should be approved.|$|E

6000|$|It is a mean {{thing and}} an unhandsome to [...] "do" [...] a {{continent}} in five-hundred-mile jumps. But after those swine and bullocks at Chicago I felt that complete change of air would be good. The United States at present hinge in or about Chicago, as a double-leaved screen hinges. To be sure, the tiny New England States call {{a trip to}} Pennsylvania [...] "going west," [...] but the larger-minded citizen seems to reckon his longitude from Chicago. Twenty years hence the centre of population--that shaded square on the census map--will have shifted, men say, far west of Chicago. Twenty years later {{it will be on}} the Pacific slope. Twenty years after that America will begin to crowd up, and there will be some trouble. People will demand manufactured goods for their reduced-establishment households at the cheapest possible rates, and the cry that the land is rich enough to afford protection will cease with a great abruptness. At present it is the farmer who pays most dearly for the luxury of high prices. In the old days, when the land was fresh and there was plenty of it and it cropped like the garden of Eden, he did not mind paying. Now there is not so much free land, and the old acres are needing stimulants, which cost money, and the farmer, who pays for everything, is beginning to ask questions. Also the great American nation, which individually never shuts a door behind its noble self, very seldom attempts to put back anything that it has taken from Nature's shelves. It grabs all it can and moves on. But the moving-on is nearly finished and the grabbing must stop, and then <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>will</b> have to establish a Woods and Forests Department the like of which was never seen in the world before.
