500|$|After its release, Born This Way: The Remix {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Jason Lipshultz from Billboard {{commented that the}} album did not re-invent anything new in terms of remix composition, but instead [...] "gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes." [...] He added that the album is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, [...] "but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will find plenty of pristinely produced club tracks <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> to. The album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of the year, as well as discover artists {{that are trying to}} command audiences the way Gaga so masterfully does." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy. So, it’s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather the hardcore Little Monsters, the kind who love every gesture grand or small from Gaga, but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only looking for some darkly elastic dance." [...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website was impressed with the diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix. And, unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again, this Remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match the diverse list of remixers." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Matusavage of musicOMH praised Beyoncé's {{abilities}} to perform live, calling her [...] "insanely talented" [...] {{and considered the}} performance at the B-stage a show highlight; however he commented that the production values of the show, consisting solely of a video screen were [...] "relatively low-key" [...] compared to other pop arena concerts. Matusavage further criticized the repetition of the songs and dance routines which had been previously performed during the singer's other concerts as the tour's [...] "most notable problem". Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the singer [...] "tore through her... set with the ferocity of a grown woman who has something to prove" [...] and felt that she tried [...] "her damnedest to win the crowd over with an equal dose of sex appeal and good old-fashioned hyping" [...] further showcasing [...] "unequaled showmanship and those killer vocals" [...] which placed her {{at the top of}} R music. However Halperin criticized the show's set list mainly due to the majority of the songs from the album 4, writing, [...] "Bey sounded terrific on all, of course, but with a... ready-to-party audience angling <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> in the aisles, rather than sway with their hands to the heavens, overall it missed the mark." [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey praised the high-energy nature of the show with vigorous dancing and [...] "blistering" [...] pace but felt that {{there was a lack of}} hits performed in the show's first half. NME editor Emily Mackay echoed his statements giving a mixed review for the tour, further criticizing the lack of hits in the set list and adding that only a [...] "paucity of material" [...] was incorporated in the set. She further dismissed the placement of interlude films in the show. A negative review came from San Jose Mercury News Jim Harrington who called the tour [...] "flawed", criticized its set list consisting of [...] "plenty of filler" [...] and the many dissipating costume changes she went through for the show. He further noted that the singer looked and sounded well but blamed the way the show and the production were choreographed.|$|E

40|$|The thrombogenecity of {{synthetic}} vascular grafts {{can be improved}} by applying a quiescent monolayer of endothelial cells on the graft surface. Whereas most investigations have focused on chemically modifying polymeric materials to promote endothelial cell adhesion, the approach in this thesis is to use micro-scale patterns of grooves, consisting of parallel ridges and channels, on a model silicone template to emulate the naturally aligned endothelium of the vascular vessels. Groove patterns are first prepared on silicon masters by photolithography, electron-beam lithography and reactive ion etching, and then replicated {{on the surface of}} silicone by film casting. Using fibronectin adsorption to promote initial cell attachment on silicone, the morphology, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells are then investigated. For groove widths ≤ 5 μm, a groove depth of 1 μm successfully induces the uniform alignment of endothelial cells, as well as actin microfilaments and focal adhesions, parallel <b>to</b> <b>grooves</b> within 1 h after seeding. Cell alignment and cell proliferation on grooved silicone remain unaltered until the culture reaches confluence. At a fixed groove depth of 1 μm, a variation in groove width, having ridge and channel dimensions (μm) of 5 × 5, 3 × 3, 2 × 2, and 4 × 2, is shown to modulate cell migration. The majority of cells, about 60 %, migrate parallel <b>to</b> <b>grooves,</b> although cells migrating transverse <b>to</b> <b>grooves</b> increase as the channel width decreases to 2 μm, the length scale at which most focal adhesions form on the ridge edge. Under flow that applied parallel <b>to</b> <b>grooves,</b> a high shear stress, 58 dyne/cm 2, induces almost all the cells to migrate in the direction of both grooves and flow. When applied perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>grooves,</b> however, the same shear stress induces about 70 % of cells to turn their migration direction transverse <b>to</b> <b>grooves.</b> While microgrooves on the substrate surface are found to strongly influence cell orientation and migration, the modulus of silicone from 0. 063 to 2 MPa has a minor effect on cell spreading and proliferation. In summary, this thesis shows that the interactive polymeric graft displaying micro-scale patterns of grooves can mediate the alignment and directional migration of endothelial cells. ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the final}} shape of liquid drops {{deposited}} on groove-textured surfaces {{is a significant}} aspect of many applications (for example, liquid drainage). This is lacking in literature, especially for drop impact on micro-textured surfaces. The effect of drop impact velocity and groove-texture geometry on the final shape adopted by water drops impacted on groove-textured surfaces is reported here. Water drops gently placed on groove-textured surfaces comprising trapezoidal (rectangular) pillars adopted the Wenzel (Cassie) state. Top view images of final equilibrium shape of water drops impacted on the groove-textured surfaces revealed a contrasting behavior between Wenzel and Cassie surfaces. At low impact velocity, the final drop shape on Wenzel surface is elongated more in the direction parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grooves</b> than perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>grooves</b> thereby exhibiting anisotropy whereas on Cassie surface the final drop shape is almost isotropic. As impact velocity increases, the anisotropy in final drop shape on Wenzel surface decreases whereas on Cassie surface it increases. The final drop spread factors and contact angles measured perpendicular and parallel <b>to</b> <b>grooves</b> show contrasting trends with impact velocity between Wenzel and Cassie surfaces. This is modelled through the difference between drop receding perpendicular and parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grooves,</b> resulting from a difference in liquid drop impregnation state, between the surfaces.

50|$|Rifled barrels {{introduce}} ambiguity to {{measurement of}} caliber. A rifled bore consists of alternating grooves and lands. The distance across the bore from groove <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> {{is greater than}} the distance from land to land. Projectiles fired from rifled barrels must be of the full groove <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> diameter to be effectively rotated by the rifling, but the caliber has sometimes been specified as the land to land diameter before rifling grooves were cut. The depth of rifling grooves (and the consequent ambiguity) increases in larger calibers. Steel artillery projectiles may have a forward bourrelet section machined to a diameter slightly smaller than the original land to land dimension of the barrel and a copper driving band somewhat larger than the groove <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> diameter to effectively seal the bore as it becomes enlarged by erosion during prolonged firing. United States Navy guns typically used rifling depth between one-half and one percent of caliber. Projectile bourrelet diameter specification was 0.015 in less than land to land diameter with a minus manufacturing tolerance so average clearance was about 0.012 in. Driving band diameter was groove <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> diameter plus 0.02 in.|$|E
