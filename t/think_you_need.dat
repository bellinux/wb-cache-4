In response to Piers Morgan's questions on Twitter as to why the woman was not detained, Turner stated that she ran out before it was clear precisely what had happened, and that the first priority had been to ensure everybody's safety in the gallery. When later asked whether they regretted not having a code of conduct for participants during the exhibit, Turner said, [...] "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> a notice on the wall saying 'Do not murder the artist'." ...|$|E

Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E
500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 115 beats per minute. Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to save me." ...|$|E
500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|The Weinstein Company also heavily recast {{the film}} with bigger-name {{actors in the}} hopes of {{attracting}} a larger audience. Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det. Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly; and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Despite these recastings, Tara Strong retained the much-smaller role of Zorra, David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers, Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy, and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen. Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as Albert Brooks, but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed {{a large part of the}} film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting however, saying, [...] "At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, everybody got recast-happy. My feeling is, you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it. After a certain point, I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> more than two, three celebrities– give it to the voice actors. It sweetens the pot." [...] Since the film's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made, the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done, giving them no opportunity to improvise. Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film, which were copied by the replacement actors.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the years}} EastEnders has {{typically}} featured {{a number of}} elderly residents, {{who are used to}} show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. Over the years they have been joined by the likes of Mo Butcher, Jules Tavernier, Marge Green, Nellie Ellis, Jim Branning, Charlie Slater, Mo Harris, Patrick Trueman, Cora Cross, Les Coker, Rose Cotton, Pam Coker, Stan Carter, Babe Smith, Claudette Hubbard, Sylvie Carter, Ted Murray and Joyce Murray. Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale in the show. She commented, [...] "I don't want to be disloyal, but I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced.

2500|$|Armenian {{heritage}} was {{the main}} but not the only target of attacks of Azerbaijani historians and politicians. Revisionist theories about Caucasian Albania {{have been used by}} Azerbaijani statesmen in the ongoing Azerbaijani-Georgian dispute over the territorial status of David Gareja monastery complex, a Georgian spiritual and historical monument partially located on the territory of Azerbaijani Republic. David Gareja is a rock-hewn Georgian Orthodox monastery complex in the Kakheti region of Eastern Georgia, on the semi-desert slopes of Mount Gareja, some 60–70km southeast of Georgia's capital Tbilisi. Giorgi Manjgaladze, Georgia's deputy foreign minister proposed that Georgia would be willing to exchange other territory for the remainder of David Gareja because of its historical and cultural significance to the Georgians. Baku disapproves of this land swap, and in April 2007, Azerbaijan's deputy foreign minister Khalaf Khalafov told a press conference in Baku that it was [...] "out of the question" [...] for Azerbaijan to [...] "give up its claims to the borderlands" [...] including David Gareja. Khalafov then stated that the monastery [...] "was home to the Caucasian Albanians, who are believed to have been the earliest inhabitants of Azerbaijan." [...] Georgian art historian Dimitri Tumanishvili dismissed this claim and stated that the complex [...] "is covered in the work of Georgian masters." [...] "There are Georgian inscriptions everywhere dating back to the sixth century," [...] he said [...] "There are no traces of another culture there.

2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem.
