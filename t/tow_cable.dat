500|$|The Admiralty {{dispatched}} nine motor torpedo boats (MTB) {{to go to}} {{the assistance}} of Express and Ivanhoe once they had been notified of the incident by Intrepid and ordered that the destroyers of the 5th DF were not to enter the minefield. Captain Louis Mountbatten of the 5th DF complied until he received the report of a Royal Air Force Lockheed Hudson bomber that had spotted the two damaged destroyers about 07:00 about [...] east of his position. The MTBs reached the ships first, around 08:00, and evacuated all of Expresss crew. Mountbatten's destroyers spotted Express around 08:40, and [...] took her in tow, stern first, twenty minutes later. The <b>tow</b> <b>cable,</b> however, fouled one of Kelvins propellers and had to be cut. [...] then took over the tow. The threat of aerial attack at 19:45 forced Jupiter to slip her tow and allow one of the attending tugboats to take over the task. Express finally arrived at Hull at 17:30 on 2 September 1940. The ship was under repair at Chatham Dockyard until 4 October 1941.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} {{characteristic of}} aerial <b>towed</b> <b>cable</b> {{has been investigated}} with many models. Because of the coupling between {{the components of the}} <b>towed</b> <b>cable</b> system, the dynamics of the <b>towed</b> <b>cable</b> is complex and nonlinear. Though the aerodynamic performances of cable is studied for a long time, the results are quiet different with researchers. The ideal method to obtain the aerodynamic forces is to simulate the flow structure around the <b>towed</b> <b>cable.</b> The purposes of this paper are to simulate the flow field of the <b>towed</b> <b>cable</b> with the different inclined angles by using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with sub-grid scale model of Smagorinsky-Lily and to study the variation of the aerodynamic forces and its influences on flow structure. The results show that the LES can predict the flow structure of the cable reasonably...|$|R

A third attempt was tried but also failed when the cable gave way. By 17:00 the Audaciouss quarterdeck was awash and it was decided to evacuate the remaining crew members to Olympic and Liverpool, and at 20:55 there was an explosion aboard Audacious and she sank.|$|E

2500|$|From 24 April 1916, the Dover Patrol {{carried out}} a {{large-scale}} operation off the Belgian coast to lay mines and nets, {{in an attempt to}} limit use of the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge to German U-boats. Murray was one of twelve destroyers of the Harwich Force that took part in escorting the operations. On the afternoon of 24 April, three German torpedo boats attempted to interfere with the drifters laying the nets off Zeebrugge, and Murray, together with Milne, [...] and , engaged the three torpedo boats, which retreated towards Zeebrugge with the four British destroyers in pursuit. The British destroyers came under heavy fire from German shore batteries. Murray was hit in the forecastle by a single 150mm shell that failed to explode, while Melpomene was hit in the engine room and lost power. Milne attempted to take Melpomene under tow, but fouled her port propeller with the <b>tow</b> <b>cable,</b> so Medea went to assist with the tow. The three German torpedo boats then returned to attack the British ships, with Medea hit three times by German shells, but were driven off by 12-inch fire from the monitor [...] The minefield probably caused the loss of one U-Boat, , although {{at the time it was}} thought that four or five German submarines had been sunk.|$|E

40|$|A {{high speed}} towed vehicle “FLYING FISH” is being {{developed}} to measure chemical and physical properties of the ocean. The depth, pitch and roll of FLYING FISH are controlled by a main wing and horizontal tail wings. The roll control {{is based on the}} PID control method and the depth and pitch control are based on the LQI (linear quadratic with integral) control method. The LQI controller was designed in consideration of the mathematical model of the <b>towing</b> <b>cable.</b> The experimental results controlled by the LQI controller were successful around the near equilibrium point but it seems that the performance is reduced at far field. The reason is that towing tension is drastically changing with the submerged depth of the vehicle and the linear mathematical model of the <b>towing</b> <b>cable</b> changes from that of equilibrium point. In this paper, the H_infty controller is designed in consideration of the change of the towing tension at the towing point versus submerged depth in order to improve the performance of the depth and pitch control.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a strategy for}} optimal estimation of parameters for <b>towed</b> <b>cable</b> systems using moving horizon estimation (MHE). The main contributions of the work include a novel formulation of MHE using a dead-band that explicitly rejects measurement noise, real-time implementation results, and the investigation of time varying stochastic disturbances as well as unknown yet constant disturbances. Further analysis is conducted on the observability and sensitivity of key parameters to determine which parameters can be estimated by the proposed approach using real-time streaming data from experiments. In addition to the real-time results, an offline multi-objective optimization is conducted to reveal the tradeoff between the computational burden and estimation variation. A Pareto frontier is used to demonstrate a series of optimal experimental configurations obtained by adjusting the model complexity (number of cable links and horizon steps). Finally, a multivariate parameter estimation is performed to explore {{the applicability of the}} proposed approach in simultaneously estimating multiple parameters.
