5|$|A {{white dwarf}} {{can also be}} cannibalized or {{evaporated}} by a companion star, causing the white dwarf to lose so much mass <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> a planetary mass object. The resultant object, orbiting the former companion, now host star, could be a helium planet or diamond planet.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. <b>That</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
5|$|This {{movement}} is {{prompted by the}} feeling that pervades {{the citizens of this}} State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E
5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split {{into a pair of}} energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized to such an extent <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> the ground state and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state {{is similar to that of}} silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance. The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138pm.|$|E

25|$|A solid bullet {{represents}} flexing {{the middle}} joint of a finger or fingers, and a hollow bullet represents straightening a flexed finger. That is, a 'D' {{hand with a}} solid bullet means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> an 'X' hand, while an 'X' hand with a hollow bullet means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> a 'D' hand. If the fingers are already flexed, then a solid bullet shows that they squeeze. For example, a square (closed fist, 'S' hand) with double solid bullets is the sign for 'milk' (iconically squeezing an udder).|$|E
25|$|Introjection: Identifying {{with some}} idea or object so deeply <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> {{a part of}} that person. For example, introjection occurs when we take on {{attributes}} of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation than we do.|$|E

He claimed the 2nd Doctor and Doctor-Donna 'stretch credulity so far <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> translucent', and that 'it's sort of silly to even bring Rose back when you've got the episode stuffed with almost every other character from the series'.|$|E

25|$|The Best Mover of the Year {{was awarded}} to the team who made the best {{progress}} up the rankings {{over the course of}} the year. In the FIFA rankings, this is not simply the team that has risen the most places, but a calculation is performed in order to account for the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> progressively harder to earn more points the higher up the rankings a team is.|$|E
25|$|New {{kinds of}} technology, {{including}} social media have {{also played a}} role. Increasingly information is conveyed in brief 'sound bites' so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> something between information and entertainment. This makes 'the news' more susceptible to simplistic and populist explanations {{at the expense of}} more in-depth analysis and the seemingly indigestible opinions of academics and experts. Pratt argues that as a result, the influence of academics, senior civil servants, penal reform groups and judges who collectively make up the 'criminal justice establishment' has steadily declined.|$|E
25|$|Rope is {{very often}} used in bondage as a {{material}} for physical restraint. In the western world, almost any kind of rope {{can be used for}} bondage, such as cotton, artificial fibers, or other materials. However, in Japanese bondage (shibari), only ropes made of hemp or jute are usually used. In Japanese bondage, the rope is usually well prepared before it can be used, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> soft and easily bendable. Between bondage sessions, the rope is cleaned by washing it.|$|E

25|$|Like {{traditional}} physical watermarks, digital watermarks {{are often}} only perceptible under certain conditions, i.e. after using some algorithm. If a digital watermark distorts the carrier signal {{in a way}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> easily perceivable, it may be considered less effective depending on its purpose. Traditional watermarks may be applied to visible media (like images or video), whereas in digital watermarking, the signal may be audio, pictures, video, texts or 3D models. A signal may carry several different watermarks at the same time. Unlike metadata that {{is added to the}} carrier signal, a digital watermark does not change the size of the carrier signal.|$|E
25|$|Reality in this Albee play is {{something}} that most of its characters try to escape. The most obvious escape route is through alcohol. Its presence is so entwined in the dialogue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> almost a character itself. Every scene revolves around the bar and decanters of brandy, cognac, anisette, and gin. Claire is alcohol’s most wounded victim, but she is also the one who, although she has the most trouble dealing with reality, sees reality the clearest. Tobias is not as ruled by alcohol but uses it to calm himself enough to maintain his patience and usual silence.|$|E
25|$|Any {{branch of}} an {{organization}} that is part {{of an organization}} banned by the central government of the PRC under state security reasons can be banned in Hong Kong at any time, and the Hong Kong government does not have to conduct any independent investigation. This provision was of particular concern because Mainland China does not have a general legal mechanism for defining a banned organization or political dissidents. One consequence of this is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> somewhat harder to prosecute regular members of an organization disliked by the PRC, as it requires the central government {{to try to find a}} crime which the individual has committed.|$|E
