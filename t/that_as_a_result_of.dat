5|$|Smyth writes <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was {{partly because of}} the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms {{if it were to}} have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Fingleton was an {{overlooked}} for the Australian side {{selected to}} tour England in 1934. With captain Woodfull and Bill Ponsford the established openers, {{there was only}} one place for a spare opener, and Brown won the position over his partner, who had performed to a similar standard during the season. The selectors asked Don Bradman, Australia's leading batsman and state teammate to Brown and Fingleton, for advice. Bradman nominated Brown, believing that his style was better suited to English pitches. On the day that the team was selected, Bradman wrote in his newspaper column, criticising Fingleton's running between the wickets. When the pair next met, Fingleton's only words were to blame Bradman for his omission; Bradman claimed <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the selection controversy, Fingleton relentless pursued a vendetta against him from there on. Fingleton also suspected that Woodfull wanted him out of the team because he held the journalist responsible for the leaked exchange with Warner.|$|E
5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced {{by most of the}} nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E

5|$|Reports from 1983 {{gave way}} to urban legend stating <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> {{overproduction}} and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April of the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo burial did include E.T. cartridges among other titles. James Heller, the former Atari manager {{who was in charge}} of the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of various titles were buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{full-time}} side at {{the west}} end of the mezzanine has three street stairs. One leads to the northeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue, the closest to the mall. The other two staircases are through a long passageway to both southern corners of Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard, acting as a pedestrian underpass outside of fare control. These staircases date back to the station's original opening. There is an entrance to the southeast corner of Woodhaven and Queens Boulevards <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the construction of the Long Island Expressway in the mid-1950s, leads only to two entrance ramps to the expressway, with no continuous sidewalk leading to the entrance.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Rutherford {{had succeeded}} in {{disintegrating}} nitrogen atoms with alpha particles emitted from decaying radium atoms. This and subsequent experiments hinted at the structure of atomic nuclei. To explore it further, he needed an artificial means of creating particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the charge of the nucleus. This opened {{a new line of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory. He assigned Cockcroft, Thomas Allibone and Ernest Walton to the problem. They built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Mark Oliphant designed a proton source for them. A crucial moment came when Cockcroft read a paper by George Gamow on quantum tunnelling. Cockcroft realised <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this phenomenon, the desired effect could be achieved with much lower voltages than first thought. In fact, he calculated that protons with energy of just 300,000 electronvolts would be able to penetrate a boron nucleus. Cockcroft and Walton worked on their accelerator for the next two years. Rutherford obtained a £1,000 grant from the University of Cambridge for them to buy a transformer and other equipment they needed.|$|E
