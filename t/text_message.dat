5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by <b>text</b> <b>message</b> and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a <b>text</b> <b>message</b> asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via <b>text</b> <b>message</b> that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by <b>text</b> <b>message).</b>|$|E

40|$|Look {{around on}} any bus, in any restaurant, or {{standing}} in any line {{and people are}} <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> Likewise, most teenagers in America are nearly inseparable from their cell phones, {{not because they are}} constantly talking, but because they are connecting with their friends through <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> Although cell phones are banned in most K- 12 schools, students are <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> constantly there as well. Few adults, including teachers and administrators, understand how and why adolescents and young adults are using <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> or how to harness <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> capabilities in the classroom. This literature review examines the limited amount of research on the practice of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> for adolescents and young adults (ages 11 - 21), focusing on the motivation, means, and methods of <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> In addition, it considers how adults have successfully engaged <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> to assess and inform youth about health-related issues. In this light, some current educational uses of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> are highlighted, along with implications for future research...|$|R

40|$|Message {{classification}} is a text classification {{task that}} has provoked {{much interest in}} machine learning. One aspect of message classification that presents a particular challenge is the classification of short <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> This paper presents an assessment of applying a case based approach that was developed for long <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> (specifically spam filtering) to short <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> The evaluation involves determining the most appropriate feature types and feature representation for short <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> and then comparing {{the performance of the}} case-based classifier with both a Naıve Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine. Our evaluation shows that short <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> require different features and even different classifiers than long <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> A machine learner which is to classify <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> will require some level of configuration in these aspects...|$|R

5|$|Palomeque {{was found}} dead on August 22, 2009. His {{body was found in}} a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was {{transporting}} Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night August 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A <b>text</b> <b>message</b> he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the <b>text</b> <b>message,</b> his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of August 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on August 23, which determined that {{the cause of death was}} drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on August 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reading and typing <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> {{while driving}} seriously impairs driving {{performance}} and are prohibited activities in many jurisdictions. Hong Kong is a bilingual society {{and many people}} write in both Chinese and English. As the input methods for <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> in Chinese and English are considerably different, this study used a driving simulator approach to compare the effects of reading and typing Chinese and English <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> on driving performance. Method: The driving performances of 26 participants were monitored under the following conditions: (1) no distraction, (2) reading and typing Chinese <b>text</b> <b>messages,</b> and (3) reading and typing English <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> The following measures of driving performance were collected under all of the conditions: reaction time (RT), driving lane undulation (DLU), driving speed fluctuation (DSF), and car-following distance (CFD) between test and leading cars. Results: RT, DLU, and DSF were significantly impaired by reading and typing both Chinese and English <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> Moreover, typing <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> distracted drivers more than reading them. Although the Chinese <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> input system {{is more complicated than}} the English system, the use of Chinese did not cause a significantly different degree of distraction. Conclusion: Both reading and typing <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> while driving should be prohibited regardless of whether Chinese or English is used. postprin...|$|R

40|$|The rapidly {{evolving}} <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> phenomenon among {{teenagers and}} young adults is noteworthy. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the relationship between <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> frequency and use of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> jargon in formal writing. The sample consisted of 152 Year 11 - 13 secondary school students (68 males and 84 females) ranging from ages 14 to 18. The participants were taken from three Secondary Schools and Colleges in the greater Wellington area. This study used a non-experimental quantitative design; specifically, a correlational research design. A ten- item questionnaire was used to assess general <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> behaviours and <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> frequency. The participants‘ formal writing pieces were also assessed and <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> jargon forms such as alternative phonetic spelling, vowel deletion and alphanumerisms were identified. The participants‘ language ability (represented by their NCEA scores for the previous year) was also assessed. The results revealed that the participants sent an average of 95 <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> per day with girls averaging about 126 messages per day while the boys averaged 64 messages per day. Overall, the research revealed that there was a weak negative correlational relationship (- 0. 01; p=. 986) between frequency of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> and instance of text jargon in formal writing. Therefore, the principal conclusion of the study was that the two variables, frequency of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> and instance of jargon in formal writing were not statistically related...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: Mobile phone <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> (short message service, SMS) {{are used}} pervasively {{as a form}} of communication. Almost 100 % of the {{population}} uses <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> worldwide and this technology is being suggested as a promising tool in psychiatry. <b>Text</b> <b>messages</b> can be sent either from a classic mobile phone or a web-based application. Reviews are needed to better understand how <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> can be used in mental health care and other fields of medicine. Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} review the literature regarding the use of mobile phone <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> in mental health care. Methods: We conducted a thorough literature review of studies involving <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> in health care management. Searches included PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases on May 25, 2015. Studies reporting the use of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> as a tool in managing patients with mental health disorders were included. Given the heterogeneity of studies, this review was summarized using a descriptive approach. Results: From 677 initial citations, 36 studies were included in the review. <b>Text</b> <b>messaging</b> was used in a wide range of mental health situations, notably substance abuse (31 %), schizophrenia (22 %), and affective disorders (17 %). We identified four ways in which <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> were used: reminders (14 %), information (17 %), supportive messages (42 %), and self-monitoring procedures (42 %). Applications were sometimes combined. Conclusions: We report growing interest in <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> since 2006. <b>Text</b> <b>messages</b> have been proposed as a health care tool in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders including substance abuse, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and suicide prevention. Most papers described pilot studies, while some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were also reported. Overall, a positive attitude toward <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> was reported. RCTs reported improved treatment adherence and symptom surveillance. Other positive points included an increase in appointment attendance and in satisfaction with management and health care services. Insight into message content, preventative strategies, and innovative approaches derived from the mental health field may be applicable in other medical specialties...|$|R
