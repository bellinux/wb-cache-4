5|$|In March 1975, Rowland {{was raised}} to air marshal and took over from Air Marshal Charles Read as CAS, {{becoming}} the first appointee to the position who had joined the RAAF after the commencement of World WarII. He {{was also the first}} engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and was selected over a more senior air vice marshal through the personal influence of the Defence Secretary, Sir Arthur Tange. The CAS was nevertheless required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the Air Force's aircrew stream so Rowland, still a qualified pilot, had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch. Soon afterwards, the stipulation for the CAS <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the General Duties Branch was removed.|$|E

5|$|The genus Pilophorus {{was until}} {{recently}} considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the Stereocaulaceae family by some authors.

5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae.

It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E

5|$|Both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus where {{discovered}} {{during the}} 1965 joint Polish-Mongolian expedition. Before the remains were prepared and described, the expedition crew believed both finds {{to belong to}} the same species of sauropod. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus was at this time considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the Dicraeosauridae, while Opisthocoelicaudia seemed to be a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae.|$|E
5|$|Buttressed by {{what was}} left of the legacy from his grandmother, Richardson {{determined}} to learn to act. He paid a local theatrical manager, Frank R Growcott, ten shillings a week <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of his company and be taught the craft of an actor. He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of Les Misérables, and was soon entrusted with larger parts including Banquo in Macbeth and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.|$|E

5|$|Later Clann Cholmáin kings were {{descended from}} Flann, as was Congalach Cnogba, whose {{official}} pedigree pronounced him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the Síl nÁedo Sláine, {{the first of}} that branch of the Uí Néill to become King of Tara in two centuries, and whose last agnatic ancestor to have ruled from Tara was the eponymous Áed Sláine, ten generations before. Congalach was closely tied to Clann Cholmáin. His mother was Flann's daughter Lígach, and his paternal grandmother Eithne had been Flann's wife.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wrens. Initially fairywrens were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> {{of the old world}} flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and Pardalotidae (peep-wrens) in a large superfamily, Meliphagoidea.|$|E

In the group stages she played doubles with Heather Watson, defeating pairs from Portugal, Netherlands and Israel in the group stages. Robson and Watson did not need to play the play-off match against Austria as Anne Keothavong and Elena Baltacha won their singles rubbers, and the 2–0 lead qualified the team for a place in the World Group II promotion play-off in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{is one of the}} New World warblers or wood-warblers in {{the family}} Parulidae. This species was {{originally}} placed under the genus Dendroica. It was recently adjusted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of genus Setophaga along with all other members of the genus Dendroica, based on the findings from a recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in 2010. The old genus Dendroica was then deleted. Within the genus, it appears to have no particularly close relatives.|$|E

5|$|The phylogenetic {{position}} of Diptera has been controversial. The monophyly of holometabolous insects {{has long been}} accepted, with the main orders being established as Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, {{and it is the}} relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties. Diptera is widely thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of Mecopterida, along with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Siphonaptera (fleas), Mecoptera (scorpionflies) and possibly Strepsiptera (twisted-wing flies). Diptera has been grouped with Siphonaptera and Mecoptera in the Antliophora, but this has not been confirmed by molecular studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common during the 17th century—11 people were made Benchers between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 {{one of the}} Benchers appointed was explicitly allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of Pension. This became more common, creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and Benchers were members of Pension. However far more Readers were appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared that Readers would remain the higher rank despite this change.|$|E
5|$|These new finds {{have been}} vital in {{illustrating}} {{the origins of}} horned dinosaurs in general, suggesting an Asian origin in the Jurassic, {{and the appearance of}} truly horned ceratopsians {{by the beginning of the}} late Cretaceous in North America. As Triceratops is increasingly shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the long-frilled Ceratopsinae subfamily, a likely ancestor may have resembled Chasmosaurus, which thrived some 5 million years earlier.|$|E
