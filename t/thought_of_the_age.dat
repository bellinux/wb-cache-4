John Peter Altgeld wrote that George [...] "made almost as great an impression on the economic <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> as Darwin did on the world of science." [...] Jose Marti wrote, [...] "Only Darwin in the natural sciences has made a mark comparable to George's on social science. In 1892, Alfred Russel Wallace stated that George's Progress and Poverty was [...] "undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century," [...] implicitly placing it above even The Origin of Species, which he had earlier helped develop and publicize.|$|E

50|$|The Scandinavian term folkeopplysning (Danish/Norwegian) {{consists}} of folk ("people") and opplysning ("enlightenment"). Together with the Swedish synonym folkbildning, {{it can be}} considered close to <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> popular education, liberal education, and community education. The learning ideal is rooted in <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Enlightenment and Rousseau's concept of popular sovereignty. It is often traced back to N. F. S. Grundtvig's folk high school movement in Denmark in the 1840s and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> study circles in Swedish labour- and temperance movements in <b>the</b> very beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century (1902). The connection to democratic ideas is considered important in folkeopplysning, with enlightenment taken {{as a foundation for}} democracy.|$|R
60|$|I have determined, therefore, {{to give a}} few {{of these}} lives, {{translated}} as literally as possible. Thus the reader will then have no reason to fear a garbled or partial account of personages so difficult to conceive or understand. He {{will be able to see}} the men as wholes; to judge (according to his light) of their merits and their defects. The very style of their biographers (which is copied as literally as is compatible with the English tongue) will teach him, if he be wise, somewhat of the temper and habits of <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> in which they lived; and one of these original documents, with its honesty, its vivid touches of contemporary manners, its intense earnestness, will give, perhaps, a more true picture of the whole hermit movement than (with all respect, be it said) the most brilliant general panorama.|$|E
60|$|To {{read all}} of Burke's {{collected}} works, and so to understand him thoroughly, {{is something of a}} task. Few are equal to it. On the other hand, to read selections here and there, as most of us do, is to get a wrong idea of the man and to join either in fulsome praise of his brilliant oratory, or in honest confession that his periods are ponderous and his ideas often buried under Johnsonian verbiage. Such are the contrasts to be found on successive pages of Burke's twelve volumes, which cover the enormous range of the political and economic <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age,</b> and which mingle fact and fancy, philosophy, statistics, and brilliant flights of the imagination, to a degree never before seen in English literature. For Burke belongs in spirit to the new romantic school, while in style he is a model for the formal classicists. We can only glance at the life of this marvelous Irishman, and then consider his place in our literature.|$|E
60|$|Too busily {{occupied}} with practical realities {{to follow the}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> through all its divagations and into all its recesses, these Massachusetts business men had had to consider methods of access more quintessential and nuclear. And they {{had decided not to}} hunt out the best thought in its merely germinating stages, but to wait until it had emerged and flowered to some trustworthy recognition, and then, rather than toil through recondite and possibly already reconsidered books and writings generally, to offer an impressive fee to the emerged new thinker, and to invite him to come to them and to lecture to them and to have a conference with them, and to tell them simply, competently and completely at first hand just all that he was about. To come, in fact, and be himself--in a highly concentrated form. In this way a number of interesting Europeans had been given very pleasant excursions to America, and the society had been able to form very definite opinions upon their teaching. And Mr. Britling was one of the representative thinkers upon which this society had decided to inform itself. It was to broach this invitation and to offer him the impressive honorarium by which the society honoured not only its guests but itself, that Mr. Direck had now come to Matching's Easy. He had already sent Mr. Britling a letter of introduction, not indeed intimating his precise purpose, but mentioning merely a desire to know him, and the letter had been so happily phrased and its writer had left such a memory of pleasant hospitality on Mr. Britling's mind during Mr. Britling's former visit to New York, that it had immediately produced for Mr. Direck an invitation not merely to come and see him but to come and stay over the week-end.|$|E

60|$|After the {{completion}} of the book on Hamilton, I applied myself to a task which a variety of reasons seemed to render specially incumbent upon me; that of giving an account, and forming an estimate, of the doctrines of Auguste Comte. I had contributed more than any one else to make his speculations known in England, and, in consequence chiefly of what I had said of him in my Logic, he had readers and admirers among thoughtful men {{on this side of the}} Channel at a time when his name had not yet in France emerged from obscurity. So unknown and unappreciated was he at the time when my Logic was written and published, that to criticize his weak points might well appear superfluous, while it was a duty to give as much publicity as one could to the important contributions he had made to philosophic thought. At the time, however, at which I have now arrived, this state of affairs had entirely changed. His name, at least, was known almost universally, and the general character of his doctrines very widely. He had taken his place in the estimation both of friends and opponents, as one of the conspicuous figures in the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age.</b> The better parts of his speculations had made great progress in working their way into those minds, which, by their previous culture and tendencies, were fitted to receive them: under cover of those better parts those of a worse character, greatly developed and added to in his later writings, had also made some way, having obtained active and enthusiastic adherents, some of them of no inconsiderable personal merit, in England, France, and other countries. These causes not only made it desirable that some one should undertake the task of sifting what is good from what is bad in M. Comte's speculations, but seemed to impose on myself in particular a special obligation to make the attempt. This I accordingly did in two essays, published in successive numbers of the Westminster Review, and reprinted in a small volume under the title Auguste Comte and Positivism.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tafsīr (Qur’anic Interpretation) by Maulānā Saiyid Abū al-Aʻlā Maudūdī (1903 – 1979). A tafsīr is an interpretation/exegesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim Holy book, the Qurʼan. In <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Islam, including South Asia, religious scholars and authors {{have tried to}} compose new tafsīrs across regions, languages, and <b>ages.</b> <b>The</b> Qurʼan, regarded as <b>the</b> word <b>of</b> God, needed tafsīr for an obvious reason: {{it had to be}} understood clearly and fully so that its commandments could be carried out with the conviction that <b>the</b> will <b>of</b> God had been done. Tafsīr literature is the main resource not just as religious books but also as social literature to analyze <b>the</b> social <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age.</b> In this paper, Maudūdī’s tafsīr, named Tafhīm al-Qur’ān, which was originally written in Urdu, will be analyzed. <b>The</b> origin <b>of</b> his tafsīr is based on his background, for he aspired to solve <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> South Asian Muslims through the Islamic way. In addition, his eagerness was matched with <b>the</b> consciousness <b>of</b> South Asian Muslims.

40|$|This project {{examines}} the early formation, and formulation, of a Danish identity. The so-called Jewfeud (Jødefejden) in Denmark, 1813, {{was comprised of}} a literary debate over the potential integration of the Jewish minority. The main hypothesis of the project is that the various disputants will articulate an impression of a Danish identity, deliberately or not. The articles chosen form two parties, one arguing against {{the possibility of a}} Jewish integration, and one arguing in favour of it. In order to obtain a better understanding of identity, as pertaining to a nation, and nation as a concept in and of itself, the analysis relies on a theoretical foundation. Applying the ideas of selected authors, the project works with terms relating to Volksgeist, rights for regeneration, and national and patriotic identity. The project concludes that the worldviews and ideals of Danish identity fall into two overarching categories, with some overlapping cases, which in turn relates to the two great schools of <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>age,</b> the ideals of Enlightenment and Romantic Nationalism...|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to study <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Caballero del Verde Gabán” from <b>the</b> {{perspectives}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stoic and Epicurean philosophic traditions given that these traditions deeply influenced <b>the</b> literatures and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden <b>Age.</b> To do so, we search and analyze several greco-roman sources that lead us to determine that although both philosophic traditions converge in <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Caballero del Verde Gabán” a clear preeminence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epicurean tradition is evident.

This was also a period <b>of</b> transmission: <b>the</b> Roman patrician Boethius (c. 480-524) translated part of Aristotle's logical corpus, thus preserving it for the Latin West, and wrote the influential literary and philosophical treatise De consolatione Philosophiae; Cassiodorus (c. 485-585) founded an important library at <b>the</b> monastery <b>of</b> Vivarium near Squillace where many texts from Antiquity were to be preserved.

40|$|Discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> Skáldskaparmál in <b>the</b> {{past has}} mainly been {{concerned}} with two related issues, first the accuracy with which Snorri reproduces pre-Christian tradition in his work, and thus his reliability as a witness to that tradition, and secondly {{the extent to which}} his work is influenced by <b>the</b> Christian, Latin <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle <b>Ages.</b> With regard to <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> these issues, there has been speculation about the possibility that Snorri or people of his circle may actually have invented myths as well as altering or modifying those they inherited from the past. One particular aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second issue is the question whether Snorri himself could read Latin. Recent work has started from the assumption that he could, and has concentrated on attempting to identify the Latin writings he may have used (Margaret Clunies Ross 1987; Ursula and Peter Dronke 1977). Many scholars have taken for granted that Latin books would have been available to Snorri; characteristic is Halldór Halldórsson in Old Icelandic heiti in Modern Icelandic (1975), who, having pointed ou...|$|R
