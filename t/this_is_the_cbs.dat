40|$|Two {{cannabinoid}} receptors, CB 1 and CB 2, have <b>been</b> identified. <b>The</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor <b>is</b> preferentially {{expressed in}} brain, and <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor in cells of leukocyte lineage. We identified the mRNA for <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor in human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells, and the mRNA and protein for <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor in human microglia and THP- 1 cells. Δ 9 -and Δ 8 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were toxic when added directly to SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. The toxicity of Δ 9 - THC <b>was</b> inhibited by <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 A {{but not by}} <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor antagonist SR 144528.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{carotid body}} (<b>CB)</b> <b>is</b> {{in charge of}} {{adjusting}} ventilatory and cardiovascular function during changes in arterial blood gases. Regardless this essential function, <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> has <b>been</b> implicated in <b>the</b> sensing of other physiological signals such as changes in blood flow and glucose levels. More important, malfunction of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> chemoreceptors has <b>been</b> associated with <b>the</b> progression and deterioration of several disease states such as hypertension, heart failure, renal failure, insulin resistance, diabetes and sleep apnea. Although the mechanisms involved in the alterations of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> function in pathophysiology are currently under intense research, the development of therapeutic approaches to restore normal CB chemoreflex function remains unsolved. Recent studies showing <b>the</b> effect of <b>CB</b> denervation in pathophysiology have unveiled a key role of these arterial chemoreceptors {{in the development of}} autonomic imbalance and respiratory disturbances, and suggest that targeting <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> could represent a novel strategy to improve disease outcome. Unfortunately, classical pharmacotherapy intended to normalize CB function may be hard to establish since several cellular pathways <b>are</b> involved in <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> dysfunction. Augmented levels of angiotensin II, endothelin- 1, cytokines and free radicals along with decreases in nitric oxide had all <b>been</b> related to <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> dysfunction. Moreover, changes in expression of angiotensin receptors, nitric oxide synthases and cytokines that take place within <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> tissue in pathological states also contribute to <b>the</b> enhanced <b>CB</b> chemoreflex drive.
