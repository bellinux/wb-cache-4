5|$|After {{maintaining}} Category5 {{status for}} about 12hours, Ivan began a steady weakening trend due to another eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140mph (225km/h) on September 10. Early next day, the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds {{just shy of}} Category5 status. However, weakening occurred again due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and at 0330UTC on September 11 Ivan passed 23miles (37km) south of Portland Point, Jamaica, its closest approach, with winds of 150mph (240km/h). The hurricane was previously forecast to make landfall on the island, though the weakening and a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the west kept the strongest winds offshore; however, sustained winds of Category4 status were reported. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, with several stations reporting over 2feet (60cm) of precipitation. Ivan's last-minute <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the west was due to a mid-level high pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A slight weakening trend continued after passing the island, due to its northern outflow being disrupted by an upper-level low over the Bahamas. As it tracked further away from Jamaica, Ivan again rapidly intensified to Category5 status, and early on September 12 it reached its peak intensity of 165mph (265km/h) with a pressure of 910mbar (26.87inHg).|$|E
