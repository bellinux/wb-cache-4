5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter of animals in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. <b>This</b> <b>particular</b> image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E
