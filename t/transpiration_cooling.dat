The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and <b>transpiration</b> <b>cooling.</b> Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, <b>transpiration</b> <b>cooling,</b> is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>cooling</b> results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, <b>transpiration</b> <b>cooling</b> uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling).

Liquid cooling seems to be more attractive because of high specific heat capacity and chances of evaporative cooling but there can be problem of leakage, corrosion, choking, etc. which works against this method. [...] On the other hand, air cooling allows the discharged air into main flow without any problem. Quantity of air required for this purpose is 1-3% of main flow and blade temperature can be reduced by 200-300 °C. There are many types of cooling used in gas turbine blades; convection, film, <b>transpiration</b> <b>cooling,</b> cooling effusion, pin fin cooling etc. which fall under the categories of internal and external cooling.
