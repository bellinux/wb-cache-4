5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy. When he was seven, {{his family moved to}} Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had torn down his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a Republican after the primary when a few Republicans who said <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> out for his stuff during his primary campaign, invited him to a party meeting.|$|E
5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing the KLA. In response to the ambush, U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E
25|$|The Melians {{argue that}} they are a neutral city and not an enemy, so Athens has no need to conquer them. The Athenians counter that if they accept Melos' {{neutrality}} and independence, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> weak: Their subjects would think that they left Melos alone because they were not strong enough to conquer it.|$|E

25|$|The {{network address}} {{was placed in}} an unused field in the Fido message database, which {{formerly}} always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> it up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period.|$|E
25|$|With the {{foundation}} of the ancient universities from the late 12th century, grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education, with Latin seen as {{the foundation}} of the trivium. Pupils were usually educated in grammar schools up to the age of 14, after which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to universities and the church for further study. The first schools independent of the church – Winchester College (1382) Oswestry School (1407) and Eton College (1440) – were closely tied to the universities; they were boarding schools, so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation.|$|E
25|$|After that {{deadline}} passed without a buyer making a firm offer, all the remaining employees were made redundant, {{but it was}} reported that the club were still negotiating with an interested buyer. On 29 May, Gretna were relegated to the Third Division due to their financial struggles, with the Scottish Football League threatening expulsion should a takeover not be completed within a week. After a takeover bid fell through on 1 June, the administrators confirmed the following day that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to sell Raydale Park to someone who will use the site for something other than football.|$|E

25|$|The goal {{of these}} {{missions}} {{is not only}} to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied spectroscopically. By examining planetary spectra, {{it would be possible to}} determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.|$|E
25|$|The {{anisotropy}} of {{the cosmic}} microwave background on different angular scales {{can also be used to}} study reionization. Photons undergo scattering when there are free electrons present, in a process known as Thomson scattering. However, as the universe expands, the density of free electrons will decrease, and scattering will occur less frequently. In the period during and after reionization, but before significant expansion had occurred to sufficiently lower the electron density, the light that composes the CMB will experience observable Thomson scattering. This scattering will leave its mark on the CMB anisotropy map, introducing secondary anisotropies (anisotropies introduced after recombination). The overall effect is to erase anisotropies that occur on smaller scales. While anisotropies on small scales are erased, polarization anisotropies are actually introduced because of reionization. By looking at the CMB anisotropies observed, and comparing with what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like had reionization not taken place, the electron column density at the time of reionization can be determined. With this, the age of the universe when reionization occurred can then be calculated.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, it was {{revealed}} that Hill could face charges of endangerment under Article 138 of the Air Navigation Order 2009 and also of manslaughter by gross negligence. Sussex Constabulary applied to the High Court for a disclosure of records order in respect of certain evidence gathered by the AAIB, which they wanted to be released to them. They wanted copies of interviews between the AAIB and Hill, the results of tests carried out by the AAIB and video evidence filmed from inside the aircraft during its display. At the High Court on 28 September 2016, an order was made that the onboard video evidence would be released, but not copies of the interview or the results of tests. Following the publication of the AAIB's final report, Sussex Police stated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> into the report in detail. They intended to present a file to the Crown Prosecution Service before the pre-inquest review on 20 June 2017, but stated then that their investigation was not quite complete. Hill was interviewed again under caution on 1 June 2017.|$|E

25|$|Rhythm {{games like}} Rock Band and Guitar Hero had been widely popular during 2005 to 2008, {{but due to}} {{oversaturation}} {{of the market and}} the onset of the 2009 recession, the rhythm genre suffered major setbacks, and the genre's popularity had quickly waned. Harmonix had released Rock Band 3 in 2010, and while well received by critics and fans, had only an estimated one million retail sales, lagging behind its dancing game, Dance Central, released during the same period. Harmonix would continue to support Rock Band 3 through 2013 with additional content patches and over 280 consecutive weeks of new songs provided as downloadable content (DLC), as well as producing Rock Band Blitz, an arcade-like rhythm game that did not require instrument controllers, but used existing music libraries. In April 2013, Harmonix released its last regular DLC, stating that they were focusing on other projects. The company noted that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to reintroduce Rock Band in the future, when they felt the time was right to bring back the game.|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{signed on}} to provide co-production funding in March 2006. The {{producers}} regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. Cameron's assistant took notes from these conversations, after which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> over the notes and start the process again. The producers invited Moffat to [...] "write anything", {{with the intention of}} cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of Jekyll begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series.|$|E
500|$|While {{most of the}} {{characters}} are normally represented in-game with pictures of birds, if the player toggles on the ICPSS (Intra-Cerebral Playback Synchro System) feature {{at the start of}} the game, or [...] in Japan, each of the possible love interests is shown with a version of what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like as a human when first introduced. Although the ICPSS feature also lists voice credits for each of the main love interests in the original version of the game, the game itself is unvoiced; however most of the voice actors who were credited later signed on to actually voice their respective characters in the drama CDs based on the series.|$|E

500|$|On June 15, 1977, the Rangers {{purchased}} Ellis {{from the}} Oakland Athletics. Ellis had a resurgent {{second half of}} the 1977 season, going 10–6 with a 2.90 ERA. Ellis complained about manager Billy Hunter's liquor policy in 1978. Hunter, responding to a raucous team flight, banned liquor on team flights; Ellis vowed that he would bring liquor on the plane to Toronto anyway. Ellis led a player insurrection against manager Billy Hunter's authoritarian style, declaring that Hunter [...] "may be Hitler, but he ain't making no lampshade out of me." [...] The Rangers organization blamed Ellis for the team's disappointing finish in 1978 and indicated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to trade Ellis. However, owner Brad Corbett sided with Ellis over Hunter, firing Hunter after the season.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{was asked}} for advice and {{guidance}} {{not just on}} the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. [...] "By force of matters purely musical I {{turned out to be the}} head of the Belyayev circle", he wrote. [...] "As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief". In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual Glinka prize, and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.|$|E
2500|$|The 1987 case R. v. Collins had {{established}} three factors {{to consider when}} determining whether to exclude evidence. First, the courts would look at whether the admission of the evidence would affect {{the fairness of the}} trial. Second, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> at the seriousness of the Charter violation, and third, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> at the effect of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice. [...] Typically, evidence obtained through violating an accused's right to have counsel (section 10(b)) or the right to security from unreasonable search and seizure (section 8) was excluded by this section.|$|E

2500|$|Part of this {{education}} involved {{learning a}} collection of sayings, called huehuetlatolli ("The sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals. It included speeches and sayings for every occasion, the words to salute the birth of children, and to say farewell at death. Fathers admonished their daughters [...] to be respectful and very clean, but not to use makeup, because <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like ahuianis. Mothers admonished their daughters to support their husbands, even if {{they turned out to}} be humble peasants. Boys were admonished to be humble, obedient and hard workers. Judging by their language, most of the huehuetlatolli seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.|$|E

During an interview on FOX Business Network’s Mornings with Maria, he stated that he believes an increase to $15 an hour would cause job loss at an extraordinary level. Rensi also believes it does not only affect the fast food industry, franchising he sees as the best business model in the United States, it is dependent on people that have low job skills that have to grow and if you cannot pay them a reasonable wage then {{they are going to be}} replaced with machines ...|$|E
