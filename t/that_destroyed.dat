From 1866 he was often caricatured in Japan Punch, which was founded and edited by Wirgman.

5|$|During {{this period}} Friedrich {{frequently}} sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums, reflecting his obsession with {{death and the}} afterlife; he even created designs {{for some of the}} funerary art in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of these works were lost in the fire <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> Munich's Glass Palace (1931) and later in the 1945 bombing of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Linda passed {{very near}} Socorro Island. In addition, early {{forecasts}} predicted that Linda would make landfall in California. The landfall never materialized and warnings or watches were {{not necessary for}} any location. However, Linda caused large surf, which crashed ashore in California, where it swept five people off a jetty. Moisture related to Linda also contributed to a landslide in southern California <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> or damaged 79houses.|$|E

In February 1991 One Meridian Plaza was badly damaged by a fire <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> eight floors and killed three firefighters.

5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, {{had taken over the}} last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E
5|$|During {{a raid on}} the {{northern}} Italian city of Verona on 12 October 1944, Raw's aircraft was hit by two anti-aircraft shells <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> its hydraulics system and an engine, wounded the radio operator and opened 166 holes in the fuselage. Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 safely to its base. He suffered frostbite to his feet, as damage to the plane's nose caused icy winds to enter the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} {{was slow to}} mechanize compared to the mills of northern England. When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass-produced products <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> the local industry. However, development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for woollen products from water-powered mills in the south west, which prospered until after World War I. At one time {{there were more than}} 300 working wool mills. The industry went into steady decline after World War I, and only a few mills continue to operate.|$|E

Following the success of Overlord, Loring continued to fly air support missions {{for the remainder of}} the conflict. By December, he had flown 55 combat missions. He had been awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions under fire on June 12, 1944 <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> ten enemy armored vehicles in the area of Coutances, France while on a dive-bombing mission.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 {{families}} and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated {{by the lack of}} political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E

In all, seven people were killed by Linfa, with damages in mainland China estimated at ¥641million (US$93.8million) and agricultural losses in Taiwan reached NT$400million (US$12.1million).|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of the series, Marceline the Vampire Queen is a thousand-year-old vampire. The Ice King is a {{recurring}} antagonist of the series, and frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo; although he is often at odds with Finn and Jake, he is generally not a serious threat. He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown that gives him magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane. In addition, throughout the series, various character and events hint at the mysterious Mushroom War, a cataclysmic war <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> modern human society.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire <b>that</b> <b>destroyed</b> the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E
