5000|$|As was {{the case}} with other popular artists such as Tretchikoff and Margaret Keane, Leeteg was never {{accepted}} by the art establishment. He had to fight to have his paintings allowed into the US as [...] "fine art" [...] rather than as a [...] "craft" [...] which had a much higher rate of import duty. Of his eight most popular subjects, seven were copied from photographs by other men. This caused many plagiarism disputes but at that time copyright had to be registered to <b>be</b> <b>protected,</b> and few photographers went to the trouble and expense of submitting their work to the copyright office. One of those subjects was a famous painting Head of Christ by Warner Sallman. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>protected</b> and he <b>was</b> forced to stop painting his copies publicly but continued to do so clandestinely on request. After his death, Leeteg's paintings rose in value to as much as $20,000 in the early 1960s but have subsequently declined in value considerably. Nevertheless, he has continued to have his ardent admirers.|$|R

Shielding for neutrons often {{requires the use of}} large, heavy treatment room doors with hydraulic or mechanical systems that {{takes a long time to}} operate, slowing down the treatment of patients. Therefore, the effect of adding baffles (as an alternative means of doors) on the spectrum of the neutron flux at the entrance of the maze, and the maze attenuation are worth studying. In the present work, Monte Carlo simulations using MCNP 4 b code were employed to investigate the resulting neutron flux reduction. The total number of neutrons decreased with the baffle of length 125 cm by about 40 %. The neutron flux decreases exponentially as the distance along the maze increases...|$|R

The paper proposes a novel approach for protecting a HDD based on Partial Disk Encryption(PDE) {{which one of the}} flavour of FDE. The proposed method is labelled as DiskTrust. FDE encrypts entire content or a single volume on your disk. Symmetric key uses same key for encryption as well for decryption. DiskTrust uses these two technologyto build cost effective solution for small scale applications. Finally, the applicability of these methodologies for HDD security will be evaluated on a set of data files with different key sizes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{orthopedic}} surgery, functional deficits of skeletal muscles is due to insufficient regeneration a remaining challenge. If the muscle trauma outbalances the intrinsic regenerative potential, it leads to scar formation. In the past decades, tissue engineering {{has been identified as}} the most promising approach to enhance the regenerative potential. In previous publications, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were evaluated in a clinically relevant trauma model and lead to a significant improvement of muscle force. Although the survival rate of transplanted MSCs at the post-traumatic site is due to the pro-inflammatory surrounding rather low, the paracrine signaling stimulates the native tissue. The hypothesis of <b>this</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> to <b>protect</b> the MSCs by transplanting the cells encapsulated in a hydrogel. The endogenous potential of MSCs could be further enhanced due to growth factor stimulation. Autologous harvested MSCs were seeded in cellular culture and prepared for further in-vitro and in-vivo analysis. To evaluate the paracrine effect, conditioned-media experiments regarding apoptosis, migration and differentiation assays were performed. In the following step, cells were seeded on the biomaterial (hydrogel, alginate) and viability as well as outward migration analyzed. The protein secretion profile was studied in order to identify the most potent stimulus through growth factors. In vivo, the hydrogel, in various combinations of growth factors and MSCs, was evaluated in a skeletal muscle trauma model of the rat. Therefore the soleus muscle was unilaterally traumatized. Muscle force measurements and histological analysis, regarding muscle fiber count, regenerating fibers, fibrotic area and vasculature were performed. The results of all groups at different follow-up time points were compared after intra-individual normalization to the contralateral side. In-vitro results showed a successful isolation of autologous MSCs. The cells were encapsulated in the hydrogel and showed a significant influence on the native tissue response regarding increased survival rate, reduction of apoptosis and increased migration. The paracrine effect of encapsulated MSCs could be further enhanced due to growth factor stimulation. In-vivo results demonstrated a significant increase of muscle force in the MSC-growth factor group. Histological analysis confirmed these results by a reduction of fibrosis, increased number of regenerating fibers and increased vascular supply. In summary, the endogenous regenerative potential of MSCs can be successfully stimulated by growth factors. Transplantation of MSCs encapsulated in a hydrogel with growth factors lead to a significant increase in muscle force due to an increased in regenerating fibers and reduction of fibrosis...|$|R

There are currently 2 types of filters available: the finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and the infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. While FIR filters have desirable traits such as stability (an absence of poles), IIR filters are able to generate outputs more efficiently. This paper combines the two types of filters by introducing a zero-counter, to make a hybrid impulse response (HIR) filter with desirable traits from both FIR and IIR. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> by a provisional patent. 1...|$|E
