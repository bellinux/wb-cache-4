5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> waxy cap, is a gilled fungus of the waxcap family.

The species, described in 1963 from collections made in <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E
