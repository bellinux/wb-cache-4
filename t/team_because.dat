5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the <b>team</b> <b>because</b> the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E

5|$|During the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, {{except in}} the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which {{resulted}} in a reshuffle in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although his average of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he batted in a variety of positions, as did all of the squad, because Bradman used a rotation system to rest his <b>team</b> <b>because</b> many matches were played consecutively.|$|E
5|$|However, Ohno would {{struggle}} at the 1997 World Championships in Nagano, Japan, finishing 19th overall. After this disappointing {{defeat at}} his first appearance at a world championships, Ohno returned home to Seattle. He did not train from April to August 1997, so he gained weight and was ill-prepared for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. As a result, he finished last in the Olympic trials and did not qualify for the Olympic <b>team.</b> <b>Because</b> of his losses at the World Championships and his failure {{to qualify for the}} Olympic team, Ohno recommitted himself to the sport and returned to junior-level skating at Lake Placid, rather than at Colorado Springs.|$|E
5|$|Kansas' {{victory over}} Virginia Tech was the Jayhawks' fifth bowl victory {{and was the}} 11thbowl game {{in the history of}} the Kansas Jayhawks {{football}} <b>team.</b> <b>Because</b> of the unexpected nature of the Jayhawks' success, some pundits proclaimed the 2008 Orange Bowl as ranking among the greatest Kansas sports victories of all time. The game paid $17million to Kansas and the Big 12 Conference and helped to boost the Kansas football team's national profile among potential recruits.

He made his debut on 5 September 1976 in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia where they drew 0–0. He continued to play in the youth <b>team</b> <b>because</b> the manager, Miodgard Stankovic, was Yugoslavian, reaching an understanding with Grčić. Iraq achieved the 1977 AFC Youth Championship where Saeed scored the winning goal in the final, from a diving header in the 90th minute, against Iran in a 4–3 victory in Tehran. Saeed was also the top goalscorer of this edition with 9 goals, scoring his first national hat-trick against Afghanistan in Iraq's 5–1 win. The same team represented Iraq in the first edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1977 where they lost 3–1 to the Soviet Union, won 5–1 over Austria with Saeed scoring a hat-trick, and lost 4–0 to Paraguay which knocked them out of the competition.|$|E
5|$|As {{world opinion}} {{hardened}} against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams and athletes. Until 1976, non-whites were legally {{barred from the}} South Africa cricket team, and, as the law required matches to be racially homogenous, this also applied to visiting squads. The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England cricket <b>team</b> <b>because</b> its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone Cricket Club (which then governed English cricket) called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government. South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} strong {{performance}} {{in college and}} during the 2002 Gator Bowl, several players from each team were selected {{to play in the}} National Football League during the 2002 NFL Draft. Florida State had three players selected, led by wide receiver Javon Walker, who was picked in the first round (20th overall) by the Green Bay Packers. Following Walker were defensive back Chris Hope (94th) and Milford Brown, who was taken in the supplemental draft by the expansion Houston Texans. In addition to the Seminoles who were drafted, Florida State running back Eric Shelton transferred from the <b>team</b> <b>because</b> of a lack of playing time. Virginia Tech had eight players selected in the 2002 draft. The first of these was wide receiver Andre Davis, who was selected in the second round (47th overall), by the Cleveland Browns. Following Davis were linebacker Ben Taylor (111th), defensive back Kevin McAdam (148th), David Pugh (182nd), Bob Slowikowski (211th), Chad Beasley (218th), Derrius Monroe (224th), and Jarrett Ferguson (251st).|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Fingleton was an {{overlooked}} for the Australian side {{selected to}} tour England in 1934. With captain Woodfull and Bill Ponsford the established openers, {{there was only}} one place for a spare opener, and Brown won the position over his partner, who had performed to a similar standard during the season. The selectors asked Don Bradman, Australia's leading batsman and state teammate to Brown and Fingleton, for advice. Bradman nominated Brown, believing that his style was better suited to English pitches. On the day that the team was selected, Bradman wrote in his newspaper column, criticising Fingleton's running between the wickets. When the pair next met, Fingleton's only words were to blame Bradman for his omission; Bradman claimed {{that as a result of}} the selection controversy, Fingleton relentless pursued a vendetta against him from there on. Fingleton also suspected that Woodfull wanted him out of the <b>team</b> <b>because</b> he held the journalist responsible for the leaked exchange with Warner.|$|E
5|$|England {{played two}} spinners; left arm {{orthodox}} spinner Jack Young replaced fellow finger spinner Jim Laker, while the leg spin of Eric Hollies replaced the pace bowling of Dick Pollard. Hollies {{was brought into}} the <b>team</b> <b>because</b> he had caused the Australian batsmen difficulty in the tour match against Warwickshire. He took 8/107 in the first innings, the best innings figures against the Australians for the summer. His performance included bowling Bradman with a topspinner that went between bat and pad. It {{was part of a}} month-long run in which he took 52 wickets in seven matches, including two ten-wicket match hauls. Young had taken 12 and 14 wickets in consecutive matches against Northamptonshire and Surrey since his omission following the Third Test, while Pollard and Laker had managed totals of only 2/159 and 3/206 respectively in the Headingley Test.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Supreme Court of India {{directed}} {{that the}} case be transferred from police investigation to a committee appointed by the court, the Special Investigation <b>Team,</b> <b>because</b> the police {{had become one of}} the riot cases. The team was led by ex-Central Bureau of Investigation director R. K. Raghavan, and the case was the sixth Gujarat riots case assigned to them for investigation. Taking into account the findings about telephone records of various activists, Kodnani and other major leaders were included in the report for the first time. The Special Investigation Team's findings added 24 more names to the 46 people arrested by the police. Before the trial began, 6 of the accused died. In 2009 the trial started, during which three of the accused died, thus the final report covered 61 people.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2014 World Championship in Turkey, {{a number}} of long-serving players {{announced}} their retirements or declared themselves unavailable. Those players included Kristi Harrower, Jenni Screen, Kristen Veal, Abby Bishop, Kathleen MacLeod, Samantha Richards, Suzy Batkovic and Jenna O'Hea. Three weeks {{before the start of}} the tournament, Lauren Jackson withdrew from the <b>team</b> <b>because</b> of a knee injury. Two weeks later Liz Cambage ruptured her achilles tendon during a pre-tournament game and was ruled-out because of the injury. This resulted in the selection of seven debutants into the squad of 12, a move seen as ushering in a new era of Opals basketball. Despite the loss of veteran players, the Opals went through the preliminary rounds and quarter-final undefeated, setting up a semi-final clash with USA. In a hard-fought game, the Opals cut the lead from 16 points to just six early in the final quarter, before losing 82–70. The Opals would however claim their third bronze medal at world championships with a comfortable 74–44 win against host nation Turkey. Penny Taylor was named to the tournament All-Star Five.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2011, at Kohsar Market of Islamabad, the {{governor}} of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security <b>team,</b> <b>because</b> of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law. (Mumtaz Qadri {{was sentenced to death}} for the assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016.) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for {{the governor}}'s funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics, while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists.|$|E

5|$|At Shores Christian Academy, Clinkscales {{became a}} top {{player on the}} {{basketball}} team, averaging 21 points and 12 assists during his senior year. On January 3, 2004, he recorded 24 points and eight assists, including a layup with four seconds left in regulation, to defeat Trinity Catholic by one point.

Clinkscales' team won the National Association of Christian Athletes championship behind a 36-win season, and he was named the Ocala Star-Banner boys' basketball player of the year. Despite his success at Ocala, the low competition level prevented him from drawing national attention. However, {{he was in the}} spotlight playing for the Atlanta Celtics, an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) program made up of players such as Dwight Howard, Josh Smith, and Randolph Morris. He joined the <b>team</b> <b>because</b> they required a reliable point guard. The Celtics won the Adidas Big Time Tournament, sparking coaches' interest in him once again. Basketball news website The Hoop Scoop named Clinkscales the 47th-best high school player in his class as he entered college.

5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England <b>team</b> <b>because</b> of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E
