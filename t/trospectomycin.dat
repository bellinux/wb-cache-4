40|$|<b>Trospectomycin</b> sulfate, a {{chemically}} synthesized analog of spectinomycin, {{exhibits a}} broad range of activity against both aerobes and anaerobes, including the etiological agents of sexually transmitted diseases. Its activity in vitro against Escherichia coli is considered only moderate. At subinhibitory levels, however, <b>trospectomycin</b> induced changes in a pathogenic strain of E. coli, UC 9451, which significantly increased its sensitivity to serum lysis. This strain of E. coli shows high-level resistance to serum in vitro, typically growing twofold within a 45 -min incubation period. Following exposure to one-fifth the MIC of <b>trospectomycin,</b> greater than 99 % of the bacteria were killed in 25 % serum within 15 min. Surviving bacteria were static in this level of serum for over 3 h. Killing was due to lysis mediated by both the classical and alternative complement pathways. The bacteria exposed to <b>trospectomycin</b> were enlarged in both diameter and length, but they still grew at rates comparable to those of untreated bacteria.

40|$|In this study, {{local and}} {{systemic}} tolerance and pharmacokinetics of <b>trospectomycin</b> sulfate {{in human beings}} were evaluated for the first time. <b>Trospectomycin</b> sulfate (U- 63, 366 F; <b>trospectomycin)</b> or sterile saline was administered to 96 healthy male volunteers in doses ranging from 0. 25 ml (75 mg) to 3. 3 ml (1, 000 mg) in a single intramuscular injection in a double-blind, randomized design. Volunteers were screened to establish baseline vital signs and laboratory test values. Pain and tenderness at the injection site, which occurred at doses of 450 mg and above, were the most common side effects; they were mild in severity and transient. Adverse drug experiences reported by subjects included nausea, dizziness, light-headedness, diaphoresis, costal pain, and perioral numbness. The perioral numbness (paresthesia) experienced at doses of 750, 900, and 1, 000 mg was probably drug related. No Clostridium difficile toxin was detected in fecal samples. Pharmacokinetic calculations based on data obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography showed that after a 1, 000 -mg intramuscular dose of <b>trospectomycin</b> (3. 3 ml), the serum mean half-life was 1. 85 h (1. 70 to 2. 02 h), mean area under the serum concentration-time curve was 140. 2 micrograms. h/ml and was linear with dose, mean peak concentration was 28. 3 micrograms/ml (20. 4 to 34. 7 micrograms/ml), mean time to maximum concentration was 71 min (30 to 120 min), and the elimination rate constant was 0. 307 h- 1.

40|$|OBJETIVOS. 1) Avaliar o padrão de sensibilidade {{in vitro}} de amostras clínicas de enterococos resistentes à vancomicina (ERV), aos antimicrobianos comumente utilizados no seu tratamento, bem como a antimicrobianos alternativos. 2) Avaliar a acurácia do E test, em comparação aos outros testes de sensibilidade a antimicrobianos (microdiluição em caldo e difusão em disco). MATERIAL E MÉTODOS. Foram analisadas 87 amostras clínicas de ERVs selecionadas de 1. 936 isolados de enterococos coletados em 97 hospitais norte-americanos, no último trimestre de 1992. A identificação em nível de espécie foi feita pelos sistemas API 20 S, Vitek e uma versão modificada do método convencional proposto por Facklam e Collins. A avaliação da sensibilidade in vitro aos antimicrobianos foi realizada pela técnica de microdiluição em caldo, E test e métodos de difusão em disco. As amostras foram testadas, tanto para antimicrobianos normalmente utilizados no tratamento de infecções enterocócicas (vancomicina, teicoplanina, ampicilina, penicilina, gentamicina e estreptomicina), como também para drogas alternativas potencialmente úteis (cloranfenicol, doxiciclina, esparfloxacina, ciprofloxacina, clinafloxacina, eritromicina, espectinomicina, trospectomicina, trimetoprim-sulfametoxazol e novobiocina). RESULTADOS. A avaliação dos testes de sensibilidade das 87 amostras de ERV revelou resistência, a ampicilina em torno de 86 %, o mesmo sendo observado para penicilina. Em relação aos aminoglicosídeos, obtivemos alto grau de resistência, em torno de 82 % e 85 %, para gentamicina e estreptomicina, respectivamente. Apesar de pertencer à mesma classe da vancomicina, a teicoplanina foi ativa contra 29 % das amostras de ERV. Entre os antimicrobianos alternativos testados, os que apresentaram maiores taxas de sensibilidade foram o cloranfenicol, a doxiciclina e a trospectomicina (82 %, 92 % e 94 % de isolados suscetíveis, respectivamente). CONCLUSÃO. O tratamento de infecções causadas por enterococos multirresistentes ainda é um desafio, e vários esquemas já vêm sendo propostos na literatura. São necessários, no entanto, mais trabalhos analisando a efetividade clínica dessas combinações de antibióticos antes que recomendações definitivas possam ser feitas. OBJECTIVES. 1) To {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of vancomycin-resistant enterococci to the antimicrobial agents that {{are commonly used}} to treat enterococci infections and to some alternative drugs. 2) To evaluate the accuracy of E test for susceptibility testing enterococci. MATERIAL AND METHOD. We evaluated 87 clinical VRE isolates that were selected from a previous study which analyzed 1936 clinical isolates collected and processed in 97 US medical centers {{in the last quarter}} of 1992. The isolates were identified to the species level by using the API 20 S System, the Vitek gram-positive identification cards and a modified version of the conventional method proposed by Facklam and Collins. The in vitro susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution, E test and disk diffusion methods, following the criteria described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The VRE isolates were tested against antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat enterococci infections (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin and streptomycin) and against ten potential alternative drugs (chloramphenicol, doxycycline, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clinafloxacin, erythromycin, spectinomycin, <b>trospectomycin,</b> trimetoprim-sulfametoxazol and novobiocin). RESULTS. Our results showed a high rate of resistance to ampicillin and penicillin (86 %). High level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin was demonstrated by 82 % and 85 % respectively. Although teicoplanin and vancomycin belong to the same antibiotic group (glycopeptide), 29 % of VRE were susceptible to teicoplanin. Among the alternative drugs, <b>trospectomycin,</b> doxycyclin and chloramphenicol showed the highest in vitro activity, with 94 %, 92 % and 82 % susceptibility respectively. In addition, erythromycin, trimetoprim-sulfametoxazol and ciprofloxacin showed the highest rates of resistance (98 %, 83 % and 69 %, respectively). CONCLUSION. The treatment options for infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci seem to be very narrow since a small percentage of those isolates were susceptible to the other antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat these infections and only a few of the alternative drugs tested showed good in vitro activity. Many regimens using various antibiotic combinations have been tested against VRE, most of them with fluoroquinolones. However further studies are necessary to evaluate the clinical role of these antibiotic combinations...|$|E
