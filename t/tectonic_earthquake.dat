25|$|A <b>tectonic</b> <b>earthquake</b> {{begins by}} an initial rupture {{at a point}} on the fault surface, {{a process known as}} {{nucleation}}. The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than 100 m while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.|$|E

S. Geological Survey’s “Did you feel it? ” (DYFI) system now provides excellent characterization of shaking intensities caused by induced and <b>tectonic</b> <b>earthquakes.</b> Seventeen CEUS events are considered between 2013 and 2015. It is shown that for 15 events, observed intensities at epicentral distances greater than ≈ 10 km are lower than expected given a published intensity-pre-diction equation for the region. Using simple published relations among intensity, magnitude, and stress drop, the results sug-gest that 15 of the 17 events have low stress drop. For those 15 events, intensities within ≈ 10 -km epicentral distance are closer to predicted values, which can be explained {{as a consequence of}} relatively shallow source depths. The results suggest that those 15 events, most of which occurred in areas where induced earth-quakes have occurred previously, were likely induced. Although moderate injection-induced earthquakes in the central and east-ern United States will be felt widely because of low regional attenuation, the damage from shallow earthquakes induced by injection will be more localized to event epicenters than shak-ing <b>tectonic</b> <b>earthquakes,</b> which tend to be somewhat deeper.

The data show that earthquake activities at the Talang Volcano were dominated by local structure movements influenced by regional tectonic movements. Between 2007 and 2009, there were three process stages related to magnitude 6 or larger tectonic earthquakes around the Talang Volcano. First stage was a period before August 16, 2009. In this stage, volcanic fluids rose to the shallower chamber beneath the Talang Volcano.

If other large earthquakes compressed the magma reservoir and unclamped the dike beneath Mt. Fuji, the volcano system might respond acutely, as discussed previously (Nostro et al. 1998).

The seismogenesis was categorized into four types; Karst collapse earthquakes, earthquakes caused by Karst gas explosion, mining tunnel collapse earthquakes, and rock (terrane) slip earthquakes, all of which are related to the lithology, structure, and tectonics of near-surface geological bodies of the area. Compared with the seismicity before impoundment, the seismic frequency increase was remarkable, with most of the magnitudes below Ms 2. 0. Therefore, the intensity of the earthquakes remained at a low level. On November 22, 2008, a magnitude 4. 1 earthquake, the largest earthquake recorded since impoundment, occurred in Quyuan Town, Zigui County.
