5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education.

40|$|Magister Educationis - MEdThis {{research}} {{focused on}} {{parental involvement in}} the rural farm area in Citrusdal to examine the nature and characteristics of farm worker parents' involvement in <b>their</b> children' <b>education.</b> This study followed a mixed method approach (qualitative and quantitive approach) to determine if parents are involved in <b>their</b> children's <b>education.</b> Questionnaires and interviews were used for data gathering. Participants that were involved were {{a sample of the}} parents, and the learners of the four schools in Citrusdal area. From the data gathered the findings of the study indicated that farm-worker parents in rural farms of Citrusdal area are involved in <b>their</b> children's <b>education</b> and that mothers are more involved than fathers in <b>their</b> children's <b>education.</b> I hope this research will make a contribution towards understanding the involvement of the farm-worker parents in <b>their</b> children's <b>education.</b> I have also proposed possible recommendations to assist the school-based personnel and the parents in developing and sustaining a stronger and more positive role in <b>their</b> children's <b>education.</b> South Afric...|$|R

Ormerod also assisted her daughters Susan Mary, Eleanor and Georgiana with their studies of natural history and art.

5|$|After the boys' {{father died}} {{while they were}} young, {{responsibility}} for <b>their</b> <b>education</b> fell to their mother. Cornelia ensured the brothers had the best available Greek tutors, teaching them oratory and political science. The brothers were also well trained in martial pursuits; in horsemanship and combat they outshone all their peers. The older brother Tiberius was elected an augur at only 16 – according to the historian J.C. Stobart, had he taken the easy path rather than the cause of radical reform, {{he would have been}} clearly destined for consulship. Tiberius was the most distinguished young officer in the Third Punic War, Rome's last campaign against Carthage. He was the first to scale Carthage's walls; before that he saved an army of 20,000 men by skilled diplomacy. As the boys grew up, they developed strong connections with the ruling elite.|$|E

From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers. The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603. Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746).

5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on Stroma, which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete <b>their</b> <b>education</b> at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E
