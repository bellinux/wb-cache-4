5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were nominally {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him. Nevertheless, from 1936 the Japanese Army and Navy held, effectively, a legal right <b>to</b> <b>nominate</b> (or refuse <b>to</b> <b>nominate)</b> their respective ministers. Thus, they could prevent the formation of undesirable governments, or by resignation bring about the collapse of an existing government.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates <b>to</b> <b>nominate</b> a {{candidate}} who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed <b>to</b> <b>nominate,</b> almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September it was {{revealed}} that the party would seek to have Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, nominated to contest the election. With 14 TDs and three Senators, Sinn Féin were three short of the required twenty Oireachtas members <b>to</b> <b>nominate</b> a candidate for the presidency. Soon after the nomination was announced, four Independent TDs agreed <b>to</b> <b>nominate</b> McGuinness, securing his nomination: Michael Healy-Rae and Tom Fleming (both representing Kerry South), Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Roscommon–South Leitrim) and Finian McGrath (Dublin North-Central). Both 'Ming' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris.|$|E

5|$|Among Breckinridge's {{supporters}} at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, {{were several}} prominent Kentuckians. They were former Kentucky Governor and current Senator Lazarus W. Powell, former Kentucky Congressmen William Preston (a distant relative) and law partner James Brown Clay, and James B. Beck. Breckinridge {{did not attend}} the convention, but instructed his supporters not <b>to</b> <b>nominate</b> him as long as James Guthrie remained a candidate. Accordingly, when a delegate from Arkansas nominated Breckinridge for president on the thirty-sixth ballot, Beck asked that it be withdrawn, and the request was honored. Over the course of 57 ballots, Douglas maintained a wide plurality, but failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority; Guthrie consistently ran second. Unable <b>to</b> <b>nominate</b> a candidate, delegates voted to reconvene in Baltimore, Maryland on June 18.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint to run Heritage Foundation, Colbert was named a possible candidate for appointment to the seat being vacated by DeMint, which would have triggered a special election in 2014 to finish out DeMint's term.

To get around the restriction imposed on his nominations, and as a favour to Theoderic, Justin himself nominated Eutharic.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right <b>to</b> <b>nominate</b> the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.|$|E
