The Macheteros anticipated that these measures would be employed against them and that the CIA would employ the recent events to recruit in universities by exploiting the fear of terrorism in the general population and decided to preemptively issue messages of their own in these institutions.

30|$|Typically, {{hydrocarbon}} production networks have several fluid routing alternatives that are applied by {{opening and closing}} on–off valves. This usually sends the wells’ fluids through a specific pipeline, pump or compressor, or to a particular separator, among other requirements. This paper presents a general methodology to compute all fluid routing configurations of a production network using a graph representation of it. The particular implementation case discussed in this paper involves interacting with a preexisting steady-state computational model of the production network. The method starts by extracting from the model the name list of elements in the network and their type. Equipment (wells, separators, junctions, pumps, compressors, valves, etc.) is tagged as nodes and pipes (flowlines, connectors) are tagged as edges. The nodes are further classified by type: sources (wells), internals (e.g., junctions) or sinks (separators). The start and end element of each edge is recorded. This process yields a network connectivity list. A depth-first search is executed from each source to each sink. The search keeps track of the edges that must be active in each path and honors (if any) pre-specified edge directions. All paths for one source node in one component are combined to form all feasible edge combinations for that source node, and these combinations are again combined for all the source nodes in each component. This is repeated for all graph components. The unique combinations are stored and reported at the end. The method has been tried in a production network with seven wells representing a typical subsea production system in the North Sea where the wells {{have the option to}} produce (through two flowlines) to two separators on the platform. The production network model was available in a commercial software; thus, there was no access to the code or the underlying equations. The model was controlled from an external computational routine using automation. The graph was extracted from the model, all operating configurations of the network were computed (2187), and then each one was applied (by enabling or disabling flowlines) and evaluated in the commercial software. This allowed to identify routing configurations that provided maximum total oil production or maximum total gas production. There were only 306 configurations that yielded a total oil production close (within 10 %) to the maximum recorded oil production. The input data of the production system model are given in the appendix for verification and benchmarking by a <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> <b>Details</b> about the implementation are provided.|$|R

Health care appears to offer the ideal combination of circumstances for its exploitation, with a need to improve productivity on the one hand and the availability of data that can be used to identify opportunities for improvement on the other.

First, that the data sets held by hospitals and other organizations, and the technological infrastructure needed for their acquisition, storage, and manipulation, are up to the task. Second, that organizations outside health care systems will be able to access detailed datasets. We argue that both assumptions can be challenged.

30|$|Root of Trust for Reporting (RTR). Reporting of {{the state}} of a {{platform}} is called attestation and is done with the TPM_Quote command. As part of that, PCR values are signed inside the TPM using a key unique to that TPM. In theory, this key could be the EK of the TPM. In practice this is not done due to privacy reasons. If the EKs were always used for signing the PCRs, all these signatures could be tracked to a single TPM and hence a group of persons that use the machine with this TPM for several different purposes. Consequently, not directly the EK but alias keys are used to sign the PCRs. They are called Attestation Identity Keys (AIKs) and are generated {{with the help of an}} external trusted <b>third</b> <b>party</b> called PrivacyCA. <b>Details</b> on AIK creation can be found, for example, in work by Pirker et al.

40|$|How is two-party electoral {{competition}} {{influenced by}} <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> even under normal political conditions? I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. House elections by inducing anticipatory strategies by the major parties. This strategic framework for understanding <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> stresses two things. First, one should focus on the major parties in order to gauge the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Second, one should not conclude that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> are irrelevant because of their minimal electoral success. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> effects are in fact present even in elections where a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> does not enter.
