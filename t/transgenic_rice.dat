This provides a means to examine which starch-synthesis enzymes besides GBSSI affect the synthesis of the different amylose components.|$|R

50|$|Pigs {{build up}} natural {{resistance}} against recurring infections rather quickly. Significant levels of protection were detected in pigs following one or multiple inoculations with infective eggs or L3s of A. suum (Eriksen, 1982; Helwigh and Nansen, 1999). This provides some hope for future vaccination strategies. Developing vaccines against parasites is highly desirable {{and the search}} for a vaccine against Ascaris has been on-going for about half a century. Still, their development so far has been very limited and the information gathered on this topic remains scarce.Initial experiments showed that oral immunisation of pigs with eggs that had been UV-irradiated induced high percentages of protection (Tromba, 1978; Urban and Romanowski, 1985; Urban and Tromba, 1982a, 1984). However these high percentages of protection could not be obtained after vaccination with native worm extracts or excretory/secretory (E/S) products (Hill et al., 1994; Rhodes et al., 1988; Urban and Romanowski, 1985) except for Lukes (1992), who was able to obtain a 89% reduction in lung and liver larvae retrieved from mice immunized twice with 100 mg of antigen in a liposome with levamisole as an immunomodulator. Only one study by Serrano et al., (2001) investigated the protective capacity of purified native antigens. All three antigens that were tested (14, 42 and 97 kDa) showed to induce significant levels of protection after 6 weekly immunizations of 1 µg of antigen in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. Since the year 2000, interest has shifted from the use of native parasite products towards recombinantly produced proteins as vaccine antigens. Different recombinants were expressed in E. coli. The As14 and As16 recombinants coupled to cholera toxin subunit B were administered three times intranasally to mice or pigs and could induce a reduction of approximately 60% in lung stage larvae recovered from the lungs of the vaccinated animals in comparison with their controls (Tsuji et al., 2004; Tsuji et al., 2003; Tsuji et al., 2001). Similarly, immunizing mice by subcutaneous injection with recombinant As24 in Freund’s complete adjuvant induced 58% of protection (Islam et al., 2005). On the other hand, no protection could be produced when the As37 antigen was tested in a similar setup (Tsuji et al., 2002).Attempts have been made to produce larval antigens in rice plants (Matsumoto et al., 2009; Nozoye et al., 2009). Immunizing mice by feeding them <b>transgenic</b> <b>rice</b> showed to elicit an antigen specific antibody response, indicating that the <b>transgenic</b> <b>rice</b> was able to prime the immune response of mice. Orally immunized mice also showed a reduced amount of larvae recovered from the lungs after challenge infection in comparison with non-immunized controls (Matsumoto et al., 2009). In the future, this could provide an easy way of producing and administering parasite antigens. However, this technique should be further optimized and evaluated.|$|E

Higher rates of incorporation of 14 C into photoassimilates (sucrose and 3 -PGA plus sugar phosphates) from l-[4 - 14 C]malate were observed in PEPC, PCK and PEPC/PCK-transgenic rice, but the incorporation rates in PEPC <b>transgenic</b> <b>rice</b> were reduced to those found in control plants by pretreatment with NaN 3. Levels of PEP, malate and aspartate in PEPC/PCK-transgenic rice were similar to those in PCK-transgenic rice but different in PEPC <b>transgenic</b> <b>rice.</b> PEPC/PCK-transgenic rice showed a low chlorophyll concentration and swollen thylakoid membranes although PCK and PEPC <b>transgenic</b> <b>rice</b> showed normal phenotypes.

40|$|Bioactive {{gibberellins}} (GAs) {{are essential}} endogenous regulators of plant growth.

Here we test this hypothesis by examining {{the effects of the}} expression of Arabidopsis GAI in <b>transgenic</b> Basmati <b>rice.</b> High-level expression of GAI caused dwarfism and reduced GA responses, and the strength of this effect was correlated with the level of transgene expression. In particular, the expression of GAI abolished the GA-mediated induction of rice aleurone alpha-amylase activity, thus implicating GAI orthologs in the well-characterized cereal aleurone GA response. The GA derepressible repressor model predicts that high-level expression of GAI should confer dwarfism, and these observations are consistent with this prediction...|$|R
