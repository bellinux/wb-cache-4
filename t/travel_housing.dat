40|$|Australia's {{population}} {{is projected to}} reach more than 35 million people by mid-century, according to ABS and Treasury forecasts. Over 70 per cent of this growth will be in our capital cities. Already, this acceleration is exerting huge pressure on Australia's major capital cities and their housing markets. Designed to achieve more compact urban development, metropolitan planning strategies for Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane require {{that more than half}} of new and future housing be constructed in established, middle-ring suburbs with the remainder in traditional outer 'greenfields'. These strategies are coupled with other sustainable city objectives related to reducing resource use (energy and water consumption, car-based <b>travel,</b> <b>housing</b> space etc) and greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|Research on projectably multi-unit tellings (e. g., stories) {{has largely}} {{focused on their}} {{contexts}} of emergence, beginnings, endings, and uptakes (or lack thereof), rather than on their ‘middles. ’ The relatively small literature on such ‘middles’ has focused on different types of responsive behaviors when they do occur (e. g., continuers). However, {{there is virtually no}} research on relevance rules that might systematically organize these ‘middles,’ including the production of responsive behaviors (or lack thereof) and the management of intersubjectivity. This thesis describes and defends one such relevance rule: Advisors are strongly accountable for responding – either vocally and/or nonvocally – at each and every complex possible-completion place. This relevance rule provides an inferential framework with which to monitor and manage advisors’ understanding of ‘middle’ units. The method used is conversation analysis – including the analysis of deviant cases – complemented by the coding of data and resultant distributional patterns.

40|$|Gender {{is both an}} archetypal and {{adaptive}} dimension of the urban condition and thus remains a key moving target for planning practitioners and scholars alike. This {{is especially true of}} women’s growing, if not revolutionary, involvement in the economy. A familiar exception is the trip linking work and home – the commute – which has been consistently and persistently shorter for women than men. That said, new reports suggest that the gender gap in commuting time and distance may have quietly vanished in some areas. To explore this possibility, I use panel data from the American Housing Survey to better measure and explain commute trends for the entire U. S. from 1985 through 2005. They overwhelmingly indicate that differences stubbornly endure, with men’s and women’s commuting distances converging only slowly and commuting times diverging. My results also show that commuting times are converging for all races, especially for women; women’s job access remains poorer than men’s, and women’s trips to work by transit are dwindling rapidly. Thus sex continues {{to play an important role}} explaining <b>travel,</b> <b>housing,</b> and labor market dynamics, with major implications for planning practice.

40|$|From an {{environmental}} perspective, the 21 st century has {{ushered in a}} number of critical challenges requiring solution within a narrowing window of opportunity if major social and economic dislocation is to be avoided. First, we live in a carbon-constrained world that is witnessing increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere capable of triggering climate change of a scale that could take centuries to reverse. How we generate and consume energy is central to this issue, and the most recent world energy outlook indicates that fossil fuels will continue to supply 80 % of a rapidly increasing demand for energy over the next 20 years. Second, we live in a resource-constrained world where peak oil, water shortages, decline in agricultural land and loss of biodiversity are indications that our harvesting of the Earth's natural resources is now occurring at a rate that is exceeding replacement rate. Our patterns of consumption of housing, travel, water and manufactured products are core to this problem. With the world's forecast population of 9 billion to be 70 % urban by 2050, the sustainability challenge will focus more closely on the resource consumption of cities and their populations. In this regard, recent State of the Environment reports on Human Settlements in Australia and internationally are not encouraging, with increasing levels of consumption being recorded across most headline environmental indicators such as energy, <b>travel,</b> <b>housing</b> and water, as well as increased levels of waste generation. The negative effects that this pattern of consumption and related urban development is having on the Australian environment [...] -one of the most fragile on Earth [...] -is also documented in the latest set of State of the Environment reports. They involve inappropriate land conversion, biodiversity loss, soil loss, challenge to safe water yields, pollution halos for urbanised coastal waters and airsheds, increased energy use and rising greenhouse gas emissions+-. Concerns about the environmental impacts of consumption have also been registered in the OECD, with consumption pressures from households expected to intensify significantly by 2030. Studies seeking to understand the determinants of urban resource consumption [...] -the factors that underpin energy and water use, consumption of housing space, urban travel and domestic appliances [...] -are therefore increasingly important in order to identify where the most prospective points for public policy intervention exist. On the supply side, increasing knowledge is being assembled on the ecological signatures of those materials and products that make up our built environment through life-cycle assessments of the manufacturing processes linked to housing, cars, consumer durables and so on and how they can be better designed into our cities by more sustainable approaches to metropolitan land use and transport planning than has been characteristic of much urban development since the Second World War. These transitions will take time, however, to make an impact. Attempts to reduce urban resource consumption more rapidly will require demand side interventions capable of affecting change in individual and household behaviour in the key domains of energy, water, travel and housing. This study is unique {{to the extent that it}} aims to assess how much of Australia's urban resource consumption is 'designed into' its cities and housing, and how much is related to the discretionary behaviour of an individual or household. The resulting knowledge will provide an evidence-based platform that is currently lacking for policy and program development by all tiers of government and industry to target areas where resource consumption can be most effectively wound back [...] -by individuals, households, housing design professionals and urban planners...|$|E
40|$|Decades of {{research}} {{have shown that}} parents {{play a critical role}} in their children's education and learning, particularly if they engage with their children's education at home, get involved in their children's schools, and involve their children in community-based activities and programs that provide additional types of learning and socialization. However, research has also identified that barriers in the urban environment often prevent parents from being more fully engaged, including barriers related to transportation, housing, and neighborhood safety. These urban environmental barriers are rarely mentioned in the current school reform debates, nor are there detailed analyses of how actual environmental issues present barriers to parents. This dissertation fills this gap by examining how the urban environment affects parents' time, energy, and resources for engagement in their children's learning. Parent engagement is influenced by the parent's personal characteristics, beliefs, and capabilities, which provide the motivation and skills for engagement. Given the decision to engage, time and resource constraints imposed by family demands, employment, or the external environment affect whether the parent can pursue opportunities for engagement. The school environment, culture, or programs for parents may determine whether a parent feels comfortable getting involved and has information on how to be involved. Community and social supports may also encourage engagement by helping parents to meet their basic needs, thereby increasing time and resources for engagement, or by providing education and training, or emotional and social ties that affect their motivation to be engaged. In order to account for each of the various influences on parent engagement, a mixed-methods case study approach was used to assess environmental contexts as well as personal influences. Parents in 70 families residing in low- and mixed-income neighborhoods of Oakland, CA completed a take-home survey and a two-day time use diary, and were interviewed in person. The data collected covered personal background, education, household expenditures, housing history and residential location choices, current and past employment, daily activities and transportation patterns, engagement activities with their children, satisfaction with the school, and future plans for themselves and their children. The semi-structured interviews allowed for in-depth explanations about how engagement fit with the rest of their responsibilities and what types of supports allowed them to engage, or prevented them from engaging more. The study approach brought together research on parent engagement with research on activity spaces, accessibility, and time budgets, and added detailed neighborhood conditions data and travel data on trips, distances, and modes. Statistical analyses of the data were complemented with in-depth qualitative information from the parent interviews. From the statistical time-use analysis, the study confirmed that parent engagement is influenced by a mix of personal, external and school factors. At the personal level, there were significant and positive associations with at-home learning and at-school involvement by income, and at-home learning by employment. Parents with longer work hours reduced their time on sleep, personal care, and leisure to allow for parental engagement. Car ownership was negatively associated with time spent on care and organizing for children, but there was no association with at-home learning or school involvement. Parents whose children attended a neighborhood school spent more time on care and organizing for their children, and if the school was less than 1. 3 miles from home, they spent more time on school involvement and care and organizing. The age of children also mattered, as expected, with parents of younger children spending more time on engagement activities at home, such as reading with their children. In contrast to other studies, there was no association by education level or race and ethnicity in terms of time spent on parent engagement, although there were differences by other daily time uses, mostly related to fewer work hours. The qualitative analysis helped to define the mechanisms behind these associations. In particular, low household incomes led to high housing mobility, and the associated time and costs cut into parents' time for engagement, job searches, and personal development. School choice was also a major factor that interacted with income. Low income parents who chose schools distant from home to improve their children's academic opportunities had trouble affording the time, costs, and logistics of traveling to school and other destinations, due to slow and unreliable transit and the high costs of gasoline. Traveling after dark was also a barrier for families who lived in high crime areas. In contrast, neighborhood community development and involvement in community organizations or with social service providers provided positive supports for parents of all income levels. Active participation in a community organization that provided a variety of training programs for low-income mothers helped to explain why parents with less than a high school education were actively engaged with their children's learning. Improving student outcomes in the U. S. requires not only providing excellent in-school resources, but also removing the barriers and providing the additional supports that parents need to manage their multiple roles including their important role as educators of their children. Using a lens of parent engagement together with one of urban planning and policy has been shown to provide new insights into the roles planners can play in helping to improve education. If parents' daily needs for <b>travel,</b> <b>housing</b> and social supports are not met, they cannot meet their children's educational needs. Planners who design and seek to improve transit service, increase the supply of affordable housing in safe and accessible neighborhoods, and provide for community development thus can help improve parental involvement...|$|E
