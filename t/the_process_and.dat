Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated by simple filtration. <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> {{the simplicity}} of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding {{is one of the}} world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly, to acclimatise them during <b>the</b> <b>process,</b> <b>and</b> to allow more {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942. Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E
5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E

5|$|Macedonia {{during the}} reign of Philip II was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding Illyrians and Thracians. Chief among Philip's Thracian enemies was the ruler Kersebleptes, who may have coordinated a {{temporary}} alliance with Athens. In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC, Philip II managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a tributary vassal, conquering much of Thrace in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> founding new cities there such as Philippi (modern Filippoi, Greece) and Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria). Philip II also fought against the Illyrian king Bardylis, who threatened Macedonia proper, and against Grabos and Pleuratus in Illyria (centred in modern-day Albania).|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments.

Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E
