Fibers have been extracted by mechanical means from banana tree pseudostems, as a strategy to valorize banana crops residues. To increase the mechanical properties of the composite, technical textiles can be used as reinforcement, instead of short fibers. To do so, fibers must be spun and woven. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the viability of using banana fibers to obtain a yarn suitable to be woven, after an enzymatic treatment, which is more environmentally friendly. Extracted long fibers are cut to 50 mm length and then immersed into an enzymatic bath for their refining.

40|$|International audienceAn {{inflatable}} beam is {{an airtight}} structure {{made of a}} soft <b>technical</b> <b>fabric</b> and subjected to an internal pressure which gives it a final cylindrical shape, a pre-stress in the membrane and a bearing capacity. Against all appearances, {{it is not a}} standard beam and it requires a specific formulation in order to take account of the internal pressure which {{plays a key role in}} its mechanical response. This work deals with inflatable beams made of orthotropic materials. The first part of the paper is concerned with the inflation of the membrane tube, an important stage which is often neglected so far in the literature. As preliminaries of the bending problem studied in the next part of the paper, the constitutive law related to the inflated state of the tube – not the natural state – is investigated. It will be shown that the consti-tutive law related to the inflated pre-stressed state is not the same as the constitutive law related to the natural state. Expressions of the material coefficients involved in the former constitutive law will be established from the material coefficients defined on the natural reference configuration which are the only ones supposed to be known. The second part of the paper deals with the bending of the inflatable beam. The Tim-oshenko beam kinematics will be chosen because of the significant shear effect in the tube wall and the problem will be formulated in finite deformations in order to accounts for all the nonlinear effects, in particular the action due to the internal pressure which is a follower load. The nonlinear system of equations obtained will then be linearized around the pre-stressed configuration and will result in a more tractable linear system. The proposed formulation allows a comprehensive study of the influence of the internal pressure on the geometry and material properties of orthotropic inflatable beams The analytical results will be compared with numerical results obtained from a nonlinear membrane finite element code...|$|E
40|$|Team {{sports such}} as soccer follow an {{intermittent}} pattern of exercise, which is known to place greater demands on thermoregulation than continuous exercise of a similar intensity. Time to exhaustion {{has been shown to}} be dependent upon environmental temperature, while clothing is known to create a microenvironment at the surface of the skin. The aim of this thesis was to determine the thermoregulatory response to soccer-specific intermittent exercise during different conditions of clothing and environment. The thermal and physiological responses of the feet to continuous and soccer-specific intermittent exercise were evaluated. Intermittent exercise was found to induce an increase in foot skin temperature of a greater magnitude than during continuous exercise of the same overall intensity- The findings indicate that the foot maintains an altered thermoregulatory response not evident elsewhere on the human body. The localised and whole-body physiological and thermal responses to soccer footwear were examined during soccer-specific intermittent exercise. Soccer footwear does not have a significantly detrimental effect on physiological responses compared to training shoes. Nevertheless, there was evidence of increased thermal strain when wearing the soccer boot, which may become significant in a hot environment. Similarly, the localised and whole-body physiological and thermal responses of the hands were evaluated when wearing goal keeping gloves during simulated goalkeeper activity- Goalkeepers' gloves restrict heat loss from the hand and in order to alleviate this problem, phase control materials (PCM's) have been developed to reduce heat load and maintain a comfortable skin temperature. All sites of skin measurement, except mean body skin temperature, showed uniformly that a PCM glove caused a greater increase in_ skin temperature than a glove with normal foam material. Therefore, the particular specification of PCM used in this study promoted heat gain rather than the intended heat loss and was therefore inappropriate to enhance thermal comfort when used in a goalkeeper's glove. The effects of three different environmental conditions (10 ?C, 20 ?C and 30 ?C) _ on soccer-specific intermittent exercise were examined, Results showed that the physiological- strain-associated with soccer-specific intermittent exercise is greatest in the heat (30 ?C) with parameters such as heart rate, mean skin temperature, rating of perceived exertion, thermal perception, change in body mass and skin blood flow all lowest during exercise in the cool- Exercise in_ the cool- condition (] 0 ?C) may be the optimal environment for performance of soccer-specific intermittent exercise, A significant_ relation p was found between core temperature and prolactin (marker of brain serotonin activity) suggesting that central serotinergic mechanisms of fatigue may play a role in exercise performance during soccer-specific intermittent activity performed in the heat. The effects of traditional soccer fabrics and technical fabrics on the physiological and thermoregulatory responses to soccer-specific intermittent exercise were evaluated. Analysis revealed that slight differences between traditional and technical clothing ensembles in physiological parameters, such- as heart rate, mean skin temperature, body mass loss and rating of perceived exertion, were not significant. Therefore, wearing <b>technical</b> <b>fabric</b> clothing gives no particular benefit over a traditional fabric ensemble.

This technology acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and it is these very few square inches that are vertically subject to body weight and pressure.

New material compounds are created; as a result, composite materials with higher physico-mechanical and service properties have been developed. One of such promising composite materials is plywood, which makes it possible, due to its constructive structure, to reach an enhanced mechanical strength. With increasing application of plywood in the national economy, it becomes necessary to enhance its physico-mechanical properties and to decrease the production costs. Plywood with different coats, varying their surface physical properties, is developed and introduced in production. In industry, plywood coating with different non-wood materials is widely used. An alternative for the so far used methods is the enhancement of the plywood strength with fibre materials of natural origin.
