500|$|The Audiencia of Charcas {{took up the}} {{investigation}} of Reyes. [...] The Audencias, the judicial system of colonial Spain, had a wide degree of latitude and independence from the viceroy. [...] Charcas (now known as Sucre) was quite distant from the viceregal capital of Lima, amplifying the court's power even further. [...] In 1721, the audiencia sent judge José de Antequera y Castro to Asunción <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> <b>justice</b> as he saw fit. [...] Antequera was a young rising star of the court, and even his fiercest critics wrote that he was likable, handsome, intelligent, and unusually well-educated for the time. [...] The Audiencia gave Antequera a sealed document to open if he found Reyes guilty. [...] The Audiencia and Antequera ordered Reyes to release the council members he had imprisoned and that he not interfere in {{the investigation}} in any way. [...] After interviewing the witnesses accusing Reyes of misdeeds, Antequera concluded that the evidence was so strong as to warrant the immediate arrest of Reyes in September 1721. [...] Antequera presented to the cabildo the sealed document he'd been given by the Audiencia. [...] The document gave Antequera the position of governor, which {{he took over the}} objections of Reyes' remaining supporters. [...] In April 1722, Antequera officially found Reyes guilty and dismissed him as governor, although Reyes immediately escaped Asunción on the same day the sentence was handed down. [...] Antequera proceeded to impound much of Reyes' property and also order the arrest of many of Reyes' friends and supporters, taking their property to be sold at public auction as well. [...] With all these actions, Antequera earned the support and adulation {{of the majority of the}} province, though he was hated by those who had done well under Reyes. [...] Antequera clinched his popularity by taking a stand against the hated Jesuits; he endorsed settlers' demands that the mission Indians be distributed to the encomienda, that secular (paid by the Spanish government) priests be put in charge of the Jesuit missions, and that a customs house be established to enforce limits on Jesuit exports of yerba mate. [...] To historian James Saeger, Antequera comes across as mostly well-meaning; he sincerely believed imposing the civil authority upon the independent Jesuit missions would benefit the Empire.|$|E

Artist Carlos Ezquerra was asked to visualise the character, but Wagner initially hated the elaborate look Ezquerra came up with, thinking it [...] "way over the top". When a proposed buy-out of 2000 AD that would have improved creators' terms and conditions fell through, Wagner {{walked away from the}} comic, leaving Mills to develop the character by commissioning stories from freelancers. The first published episode appeared in issue 2, based on a script by Peter Harris, rewritten by Mills and drawn by Mike McMahon, which alienated Ezquerra. Wagner returned to write the character from issue 9, and has written the majority of Judge Dredd stories since. Ezquerra returned in 1982 to draw the [...] "Apocalypse War" [...] storyline, and continues to draw the character semi-regularly.|$|E

At their best they manifested the loyalty of soldiers. Heedful of the Federal Government, they strove <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> <b>justice</b> over the lands which had been allotted to their care, and their flags--the Stars and Stripes--as I came upon them fluttering from the peaks of their cabins were to me the guidons of a new and valiant skirmish line.

Secondly, The legislative, or supreme authority, cannot assume to its self a {{power to}} rule by extemporary {{arbitrary}} decrees, but is bound <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> <b>justice,</b> and decide {{the rights of}} the subject by promulgated standing laws, and known authorized judges:* for the law of nature being unwritten, and so no where to be found but in the minds of men, they who through passion or interest shall miscite, or misapply it, cannot so easily be convinced of their mistake where there is no established judge: and so it serves not, as it ought, to determine the rights, and fence the properties of those that live under it, especially where every one is judge, interpreter, and executioner of it too, and that in his own case: and he that has right on his side, having ordinarily but his own single strength, hath not force enough to defend himself from injuries, or to punish delinquents. To avoid these inconveniences, which disorder men's propperties in the state of nature, men unite into societies, that they may have the united strength of the whole society to secure and defend their properties, and may have standing rules to bound it, by which every one may know what is his. To this end it is that men give up all their natural power to the society which they enter into, and the community put the legislative power into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty, {{as it was in the}} state of nature.|$|E

40|$|Making {{the justice}} process ‘child friendly’ {{is a key}} {{priority}} for the children’s rights community. An abundance of commentary has been produced by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to highlight how justice proceedings can be made more accessible for children and, in 2010, the Council of Europe issued its comprehensive ‘Guidelines on Child Friendly Justice’. Despite these efforts, children remain ill-informed, {{not just about the}} nature of justice proceedings in which they may be implicated, but about the very existence and scope of their rights and how to enforce them. Despite unequivocal acknowledgement that the availability and accessibility of information is the crucial starting point in a children’s rights-based approach <b>to</b> <b>dispensing</b> <b>justice,</b> there has been surprisingly little attempt to scrutinise the availability, quality and accessibility of information about laws and policies affecting children. This article takes a closer look at what, exactly, ‘child friendly’ information means in practice. In doing so, we argue that attempts to develop child friendly information have yet to progress beyond adult-driven, largely tokenistic and superficial re-branding exercises. As such, efforts to develop child friendly resources are often of limited value in empowering young people to develop their legal literacy and realise their rights in practice. We reflect on our attempt to develop an explicitly children’s rights-based approach to the development of child friendly resources with a view to enhancing their purchase. This took place {{in the context of a}} pilot project, commissioned by the Council of Europe in June 2014, to create a child friendly version of their Child Friendly Justice Guidelines...|$|R

Yet as governor, he was sworn to uphold the rule of law. He attempted to finesse the matter by seeking to appeal to both sides, demanding that the law be followed, but that he would, as he stated in 1892, [...] "willingly lead a mob in lynching a Negro who had committed an assault on a white woman". Under criticism, he amended this to a willingness to lead the lynching of [...] "a man of any color who assaults a virtuous woman of any color"—the adjective [...] "virtuous" [...] limiting the commitment, in Tillman's view, to assaults on white women.|$|R
