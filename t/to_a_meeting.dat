5|$|In an editorial, the Lyttelton Times welcomed Sewell's {{intention}} of representing the electorate again, but criticised {{him for the}} briefness of his statement.

5|$|Although the 1st Marine Division {{landed at}} Wonsan {{as part of}} Almond's US X Corps, Almond and Major General Oliver P. Smith of the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> before the landing at Inchon, when Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious {{landings}} are {{even though he had}} never been involved in one. Smith believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact that higher headquarters in Tokyo said otherwise, but Almond felt Smith was overly cautious. The mutual distrust between the commanders caused Smith to slow the 1st Marine Division's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond's instructions. Smith established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{suffered}} a stroke which paralyzed him. In an attempt to strengthen his son's claim to the throne, he had the child Solomon crowned in the one-year-long period beginning {{in the autumn of}} 1057. For the same purpose, Andrew also arranged the engagement of his son with Juditha daughter of the late Emperor Henry III, and sister of the new German monarch, Henry IV (r. 1056–1105)in September 1058. Thereafter, according to an episode narrated by most Hungarian chronicles, the king invited Duke Béla <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> at Tiszavárkony. At their meeting, Andrew seemingly offered his brother to freely choose between a crown and a sword, which were the symbols of the kingdom and the ducatus, respectively. Duke Béla, who had previously been informed by his partisans in Andrew's court that he would be murdered on the king's order if he opted for the crown, chose the sword.|$|E

5|$|Bohr and Wheeler {{set to work}} {{applying}} the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in Physical Review on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Bonventre {{was called}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with Rastelli in Queens. He {{was picked up}} by Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they reached their destination. The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, rumours purported that Stanley Matthews {{wanted to}} leave Stoke to further his career. This led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> at Kings Hall, {{attended}} by three thousand people with a further thousand outside. Matthews opted to stay with Stoke and helped the club to finish in seventh place in the 1938–39 season. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented further progress as the league was suspended for six years. After resumption of the FA Cup, 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a sixth round away game against Bolton Wanderers when the crush barriers gave way on the terraces.|$|E

5|$|Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat {{member from}} Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to {{advocate}} Syro-Palestinian unity {{before the arrival}} of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older Politicians, was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.|$|E
5|$|For the Battle of Gazala, Rommel divided {{his command}} in two, taking {{personal}} {{command of the}} mobile units of the Deutsches Afrika Korps and Italian XX Motorized Corps, which he led around the southern flank of Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie's British Eighth Army. Rommel left the infantry of the Italian X and XXI Corps under General der Panzertruppe Ludwig Crüwell to hold {{the rest of the}} Eighth Army in place. This command arrangement went awry on 29 May 1942 when Crüwell was taken prisoner. Lacking an available commander of sufficient seniority, Kesselring assumed personal command of Gruppe Crüwell. Flying his Fieseler Fi 156 Storch <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting,</b> Kesselring was fired upon by a British force astride Rommel's line of communications. Kesselring called in an air strike by every available Stuka and Jabo. His attack was successful; the British force suffered heavy losses and was forced to pull back.|$|E
5|$|In 1092, {{the peace}} {{began to break}} down. Based {{on the idea that}} the Scots {{controlled}} much of modern Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus's new castle at Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. It is unlikely that Malcolm controlled Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus's father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting.</b> Malcolm travelled south to Gloucester, stopping at Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute be judged by the English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept, and returned immediately to Scotland.|$|E
