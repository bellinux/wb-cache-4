Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} hand it to EastEnders. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>that!</b> I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E

In her scanty nightdress, and barefooted, she recalled a mediaeval penitent being reproved for her sins in blasphemous terms. Those lethal weapons were always present to Schomberg's mind. Personally, he had never seen them. His part, ten days after his guests' arrival, had been to lounge in manly, careless attitudes on the veranda--keeping watch--while Mrs. Schomberg, provided with a bunch of assorted keys, her discoloured teeth chattering and her globular eyes absolutely idiotic with fright, was [...] "going through" [...] the luggage of these strange clients. Her terrible Wilhelm had insisted on it.|$|E

[...] And truly he looked right fine and princely when he said that.

It may be if {{this goes on}} that the {{shutters}} will be found of the greatest use, and indeed they have probably stopped a good many balls from coming in and so saved some of our lives, but on the first occasion Wilfrid and your daughter owed their lives to their being prepared and armed, while the natives relying upon surprising them had left their guns in the wood. The shutters were not closed until after they made off, and had they not been there those four natives could never have passed across the clearing and reached the house under the fire of two cool and steady marksmen.|$|E

6000|$|Then Judith {{went on to}} beg Sophy {{to write}} to her former mistress, Mrs Barnard, with all her <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> past kindness. <b>That</b> seemed to exhaust her a good deal, and she lay back, just saying faintly, [...] "If you would read me a little bit, miss." ...|$|R

[...] "Long, {{long did}} I hope my little one was safely {{sheltered}} from all my troubles in the dear old cloisters of Soissons, {{and that it}} was caution in my good aunt the abbess that prevented my hearing of her; but through my faithful servants, my Lord Flemyng, who had been charged to speed her from Scotland, at length let me know that the ship in which she sailed, the Bride of Dunbar, had been never heard of more, and was thought to have been cast away in a tempest that raged two days after she quitted Dunbar. And I--I shed some tears, but I could well believe that the innocent babe had been safely welcomed among the saints, and I could not grieve that she was, as I thought, spared from the doom that rests upon the race of Stewart. Till one week back, I gave <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> child of sorrow as cradled in Paradise." ...|$|E
6000|$|In every Samoan {{household}} the day {{is closed}} with prayer and the singing of hymns. The omission of this sacred duty would indicate, not only a lack of religious training in the house chief, but a shameless disregard {{of all that is}} reputable in Samoan social life. [...] No doubt, to many, the evening service {{is no more than a}} duty fulfilled. The child who says his prayer at his mother's knee can have no real conception of the meaning of the words he lisps so readily, yet he goes to his little bed with a sense of heavenly protection that he would miss were the prayer forgotten. The average Samoan is but a larger child in most things, and would lay an uneasy head on his wooden pillow if he had not joined, even perfunctorily, in the evening service. With my husband, prayer, the direct appeal, was a necessity. When he was happy he felt impelled to offer <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> undeserved joy; when in sorrow, or pain, to call for strength to bear what must be borne.|$|E
