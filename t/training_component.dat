2500|$|HRDC’s {{evaluation}} {{of programs for}} in-school youth, taken from its June 1997 final report on the Effectiveness of Employment-Related Programs for Youth: Lessons Learned from Past Experience sheds more light on the long-term impact of limited short-term results. This {{study found that the}} most effective programs for young people provide sustained adult contact. [...] Results indicate that the most effective strategies for keeping young people in school are those that build bridges to the world of work while young people are still in school. The most effective strategies were found to combine a <b>training</b> <b>component</b> with strong links to the employer community, more formal training linked to on-the-job training and work experience, and job search assistance and transitional wage subsidies (HRDC June 1997). [...] There is some evidence that co-operative education programs lead to improved employment outcomes in post-secondary school although the number of work experience placements offered by employers is quite limited.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to analyze {{fidelity}} features in parent-implemented interven-tions for young children with disabilities. The authors conducted a review of 24 studies pub-lished in nine peer-reviewed journals. Each identified article was scored on the following categories: the participant characteristics, settings, study design, independent variables, meas-urement of implementation and intervention fidelity, parent <b>training</b> <b>components,</b> dependent variables, social validity, overall outcomes, and study rigor. The results indicated that, although all studies described parent <b>training</b> <b>components,</b> few reported implementation fidel-ity. Across the studies trainers {{were most likely to}} use performance-based feedback and mod-eling to support parent implementation of the intervention. Although 20 studies used single-case design methodologies, only 2 studies met contemporary single-case research design standards.
