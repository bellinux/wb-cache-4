2500|$|Lamborn is {{the subject}} of a famous anecdote in which he {{informed}} the Duke of Dorset about one near miss that: [...] "It was tedious near your Grace!" [...] Lamborn had a strong rural accent and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this apparently amused the Duke for some time to come.|$|E
2500|$|Wisconsin State Assembly member Roger Rivard {{became the}} subject of {{controversy}} in October 2012 because of his 2011 comment about a case against a high school senior for raping a 14-year-old girl. He said that when he was a teenager his father had warned him that, [...] "Some girls rape easy". Rivard later told the Journal-Sentinel that his words had been taken out of context and that [...] "it was advice to me, telling me, 'If you're going to , you may have consensual sex that night and then the next morning it may be rape.' So <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it was, 'Just remember, Roger, some girls, they rape so easy. It may be rape the next morning.'" [...] Rivard lost the election to Democrat Stephen Smith.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had never}} been so little pleased with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "belawng." [...] "He comes from nowhere. He {{has spent most of his}} life in Italy." ...|$|E
60|$|Why the Lord Chamberlain I {{could not}} {{precisely}} see, nor could he, {{but that was}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> felt, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> conclusively, and them was no more discussion.|$|R
50|$|He won the Herald Sun Tour in October 2007 winning 2 stages along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> also <b>said</b> it was {{his most}} {{important}} and favourite victory in his life.|$|R
6000|$|... "By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> Bathurst," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> on {{the evening}} of his return, [...] "I met an old {{acquaintance}} in Lucknow; you would never guess who it was--Forster." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Tod. And {{there was}} {{something}} in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it that was more than a mere declaration of pride or of affection. Then he looked at Felix.|$|E
60|$|It was funny, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> such things; yet {{she liked}} him, really, the more for it. They fell in for {{her with a}} general, or rather with a special, vision. But she spoke with a mild despair.|$|E
6000|$|Clearly now, for the girl, {{in spite}} of lucidity and logic, there was {{something}} in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> things--! She faced him in all her desire to please him, and then her word quite simply and definitely showed it. [...] "I do like you, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{ought to}} get a fathom most of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> across," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and turned to Whitney. [...] "You might stand by below to pull up the board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> Pitt," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "you've got {{a man of}} sorts, of course? One {{of those}} frightful fellows who forgot to pack your collars? Bring him along, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|Midwinter {{looked at}} the man with a blank, dreadful {{helplessness}} in his face. [...] "Show me <b>the</b> <b>way</b> out," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The place is dark, and the room turns round with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY. He only {{smiled and}} said: [...] "We'll {{see if you}} gain weight to-morrow." [...] As if that mattered now! Why, I'm way above normal as it is! But you know Stanton--always putting you off. But I could tell by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it he'd be willing to consider---- ...|$|E
6000|$|On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to himself, [...] "If she {{is going}} to skip Christmas, and I am going to skip Christmas, why should we not skip it together? That would truly be most fit and gladsome, and it would serve Barnbury aright. I'll go in and lay it before her." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{that was}} why they were there {{because it was a}} place where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it was queer what Athy said and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it. It was not a cod because they had run away. He looked with the others across the {{playground}} and began to feel afraid.|$|E
5000|$|When Nash asked Nashville's mayor, Ben West, on {{the steps}} of City Hall, [...] "Do you feel it is wrong to {{discriminate}} against a person {{solely on the basis of}} their race or color?", the mayor admitted that he did. Three weeks later, the lunch counters of Nashville were serving blacks. Reflecting on this event, Nash said, [...] "I have a lot of respect for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> responded. He didn't have to respond <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> felt it was wrong for citizens of Nashville to be discriminated against at the lunch counters solely on the basis of the color of their skin. That was the turning point. That day was very important." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was after}} this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet in the grounds, began {{to chat with}} him in ignorance of the news, which Sir James for some reason did not care to tell him immediately. But when the entail was touched on in <b>the</b> usual <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "My dear sir, {{it is not for}} me to dictate to you, but for my part I would let that alone. I would let things remain as they are." ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{himself did}} not {{understand}} it very well. Nathan asked him why it would not split <b>the</b> other <b>way,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that that was across the grain. But when Nathan {{asked him what he}} meant by grain, he could not tell.|$|R
60|$|We just {{caught the}} train to Warwick, and by luck {{got back to the}} hotel ten minutes before the mother turned up. Young Milberry carried the child in his arms all <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> I could have the hamper for myself, and gave me half-a-sovereign extra on the {{understanding}} that I kept my mouth shut, which I did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Jakey, it's got all its things on, {{just as he}} said he would. NOW you {{see what}} we wasn't certain about--its hair. It's not long now the way it was: it's got it cropped close to its head, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he would. Huck, I never see {{anything}} look any more naturaler than what It does." ...|$|E
6000|$|Euphemia didn't like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "all right." [...] It {{seemed to}} her, she said, {{as if he}} {{intended}} to do something which {{would be all right}} for him, but not at all so for us. I saw she was nervous about it, for that evening she began to ask me questions about the traveling propensities of soap-makers, upholsterers, and dentists.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, by no means," [...] {{returned}} the Captain, {{pulling out a}} large clasp-knife, with which he proceeded carefully to pare his left thumb nail. [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> Doctor," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> carelessly, [...] "were you ever in love?" ...|$|R
5000|$|You {{can imagine}} just how happy we were after the referee blew the final whistle. After the {{catastrophe}} I drove home with Otto Rehhagel {{who was also}} living in Essen at the time. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me {{there would be a}} new manager the next day. He knew what would happen, and it wasn't even his fault, but Rehhagel would be made the scapegoat to save face for the club. Borussia Dortmund captain Manfred Burgsm√ºller ...|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from his}} mother, Al Saher's family were never {{supportive}} of his direction {{in becoming a}} musician. They had no faith in {{him that he would}} become successful, and instead wanted him to become a doctor or a lawyer. Saher's brother once took him to different places where people usually sang, and told him it's your choice to sing a respectful way or you can choose to do it <b>the</b> bad <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> only <b>way</b> to achieve success is if you respect your music and respect yourself.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} that kind of rummy {{something}} in his manner. It was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it, don't you know. He didn't like the suit. I pulled myself together to assert myself. Something seemed to tell me that, unless I was jolly careful and nipped this lad in the bud, he would be starting to boss me. He had the aspect of a distinctly resolute blighter.|$|E
6000|$|He {{finally stopped}} {{looking at the}} fishwife--he met his companion's enquiry. [...] "Oh you know!" [...] There was {{something}} in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it that made, between them, more of an equality than she had yet imagined; but it had also more the effect of raising her up than of letting him down, and what it did with her was shown {{by the sound of}} her assent.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{my teacher}} would explain--he was a {{painstaking}} gentleman; [...] "you say {{it as if}} it were spelt K-i-r-c-h-k-e. There is no k. It is--." [...] And he would illustrate to me again, for the twentieth time that morning, how it should be pronounced; the sad thing being that I could never for the life of me detect any difference between <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it and the way I said it. So he would try a new method.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor dear little fellow, I {{dare say}} that was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was lost,' <b>said</b> Mrs. Hazleby; 'when once young people take that kind of {{nonsense}} into their head, there is an end of anything else. Well, and how was it we {{never heard of it}} all this time?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The elder man {{lay back}} and looked at him with half-closed eyes. [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> Dorian," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> after a pause, [...] "'what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose'--how does the {{quotation}} run?--'his own soul'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kelley {{saw that}} it was {{necessary}} to go <b>the</b> whole <b>way,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> quietly: [...] "That was all fixed up yesterday. You see, he wanted to save your mother and you, and he came to me--and wanted me to take him in as a partner, and--I did it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam, it was dreadful!" [...] cried Grace. [...] "Mr. Waltham was so reckless. I couldn't {{understand}} him at all. When I said I would ride with him I supposed {{we were going}} {{right back to the}} hotel. But on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it was too fine a night to go in yet, and begged me to go a little farther, and so finally I consented. Then he drove the car on and on, ever so many miles, until we reached Dennville." ...|$|E
6000|$|Something {{happy and}} easy, {{something}} above all unconscious, in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this, brought home again to his companion the facility of his attitude and the enviability of his state. [...] "See her then by all means. And consider too," [...] Strether went on, [...] "that you really give your sister a lift in letting her come to you. You {{give her a}} couple of months of Paris, which she hasn't seen, if I'm not mistaken, since just after she was married, and which I'm sure she wants but the pretext to visit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we did--heard a howl or two. Does {{that prove}} anybody was killed? Course it don't. And we seen four men run, then this one come walking {{out and we}} took it for a ghost. No more ghost than you are. It was Jake Dunlap his own self, and it's Jake Dunlap now. He's been and got his hair cropped, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he would, and he's playing himself for a stranger, {{just the same as}} he said he would. Ghost? Hum!--he's as sound as a nut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lane wasn't wise when {{he tried}} to play that man <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did," [...] <b>said</b> Steel, who stood beside me, but I {{scarcely}} heeded him, for Carson Haldane, who must have reached Bonaventure very recently, nodded to me as he took his seat in a chair Thorn brought him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> talks," [...] <b>said</b> MacIan, almost indifferently; [...] "but he says rummier {{things than}} that. He {{says that a}} man's doctor ought to decide what woman he marries; {{and he says that}} {{children}} ought not to be brought up by their parents, because a physical partiality will then distort the judgement of the educator." ...|$|R
5|$|Atchison {{remarked that}} his {{theme for the}} film, deemed an {{inspirational}} film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> wanted to portray African Americans {{in a manner that}} was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizes the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|R
