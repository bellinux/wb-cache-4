25|$|Late January {{production}} picked up, attaining {{three or}} four units per day. However, it soon slowed down again because the new Commander-in-Chief, Robert Nivelle, ordered that priority {{should be given to}} the manufacture of the Schneider CD <b>towing</b> <b>tractor.</b> As a result, production fell from seventy tanks between 28 January and 27 February to sixty between the latter date and 28 March and only twenty additional vehicles were manufactured until 12 April. On 15 March the total accepted by the Army had reached 150 tanks; by 1 April this number had risen to 208, by 1 June to 322. Then production almost came to a halt, both because of a loss of interest in the type and to maintain a sufficient spare parts manufacture. The total reached 340 on 30 September, 370 on 1 December and 372 on 19 December. The full order would not be completed until August 1918. The ultimate costs of the project were about fifty million French franc. Official factory deliveries were fifty in 1916, 326 in 1917 and twenty-four in 1918. Of these 397 were transferred to the French Army.|$|E

50|$|The STZ-5 was {{designed}} at the Stalingrad tractor factory with initial {{work on the}} project beginning in 1933. The designers borrowed elements and ideas from the British Vickers Carden-Loyd light tank and the American International TA-40 agricultural tractor. Their design goal was to achieve a vehicle capable of acting as a military (<b>towing)</b> <b>tractor</b> and a civilian agricultural tractor. They developed two vehicles on the same chassis and engine, the STZ NATI 1TA (STZ-3) agricultural tractor and the STZ NATI 2TB (STZ-5) military transport. The vehicles were submitted for trial in 1935 and were approved however design refinements for mass production were continued until 1937 when mass production began.|$|E

By 1942 so many aircraft were stopping at North Bay that No. 124 Squadron, RCAF, set up a seven-man detachment at the airport. Under the command of a Flying Officer (today's rank, Lieutenant), two aeroengine mechanics, an electrician and an airframe mechanic re-fuelled, serviced and repaired the aircraft.

40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{analysis}} of the structure and the power transmission system of aircraft <b>towing</b> <b>tractor,</b> a new project applying hydraulic drive hybrid power is put forward considering the requirements of towing aircraft and working process without towbar. As the testing and controlling signals of the system are multi channel and distributed, the testing program is designed via LXI bus. The experimental data indicate both the pressure change of accumulators and the capacity change of the hydraulic pump/motor are ideal. All the data are in good agreement with expectation. The research may highlight the design for a new generation aircraft <b>towing</b> <b>tractor.</b> Index Terms—LXI, Aircraft <b>towing</b> <b>tractor,</b> Hydraulic drive, Hybrid power, pump/motor I...|$|E

40|$|Study to {{determine}} the appropriate of harvesting time and main crop stubble height for stubble-lodging rice ratooning method was conducted at farmers’ fields in Dontro subdistrict, Chalermprakiat district, Nakorn Si Thammarat province, from January to September 2011. Rice cultivar named Phitsanulok 2 {{was used in this}} experiment at the seed rate of 20 kg/rai by wet broadcast seeding for the main crop. The experiment was designed in split plot with 4 replication. The main plot was 2 groups of harvesting times: 28 and 34 days after 80 % flowering. The subplots was 3 groups of stubble height: 5 - 10, 20 - 25, and 40 - 45 cm. Plot size was 10 x 10 m 2. Stubble lodged was done by driving a <b>towing</b> <b>tractor</b> with tires wheels. Wet broadcast seeding rice was conducted in the second crop to compare growth and yield. The result showed that there was no significantly different yield of the main crop between the 28 days and the 34 days. And there was also no significantly different yield of the stubble-lodging rice ratooning which was harvested different times: 28 and 34 days with 379 and 423 kg/rai, respectively. The yield of stubble height of 20 - 25 cm. was the highest, 445 kg/rai, but there was no significantly different from the 5 - 10 cm., 420 kg/rai. The 40 - 45 cm. high stubble had the lowest yields, 356 kg/rai but there was no significantly different from the 5 - 10 cm. There was interaction between main crop harvesting time and stubble height on the yield. Main crop harvesting time at 34 days after 80 % flowering at 20 - 25 cm. stubble height was the highest yield, 529 kg/rai which the yield was 81 % and 98 % of the main crop and the wet broadcast seeding in the second crop, respectively...|$|E
