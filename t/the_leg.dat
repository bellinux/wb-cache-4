5|$|In {{addition}} to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman known for his fitness. He developed his skills through persistent training with professional sprinters {{in order to improve}} his anticipation and speed off the mark. Brown often fielded at slip or in the covers. With Australia boasting <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> spin pairing of O'Reilly and Grimmett in the 1930s, close-catchers were frequently used. Along with Fingleton, Brown often fielded in <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> trap position.|$|E
5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E
30|$|The {{structure}} of the robot is divided into six separate beams, see Fig.  2. Specifically, each of <b>the</b> three <b>legs,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> center of mass, {{the connection between the}} center of mass and <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> front <b>leg</b> are all considered to be separate beams. The case when <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> is located between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> center of mass is also formed using six beams: specifically, <b>the</b> three <b>legs,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> middle <b>leg,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> center of mass and the connection between the center of mass and <b>the</b> front <b>leg.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the thrust, <b>the</b> {{acceleration}} of <b>leg</b> mass {{away from the}} floor develops upward linear momentum in <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the {{acceleration of}} the angular expansion between legs and trunk develops angular momentum in <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> When <b>the</b> thrust is completed, movement of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> {{with respect to the}} trunk ceases suddenly and, as a result, the linear and angular momentum of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are transferred to the entire body.|$|R

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E
5|$|After the Test, Bradman managed {{only six}} as Australia scored 317 and 0/22 to defeat Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests. He was again caught in <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> trap by Denis Compton.|$|E

In June 1931, James Gorney, a resident of Pine Island, allegedly attempted to rob the station and station agent. Harriman police shot Gorney in <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> which was crippling enough that it required amputation of <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> His lawyer, who got him off third-degree burglary charges and several acquittals, also negotiated a payment of $20,000 to Gorney from Harriman for {{the pain and suffering}} of the amputated leg, despite the attempted crime he was shot for. The jury deliberated for five hours before reaching a verdict of awarding Gorney the money.|$|E

5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E

5|$|Edrich then {{relieved}} Coxon, who had bowled {{his first}} seven overs in Test cricket {{for the loss}} of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a bouncer, which Bradman tried to swing to <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> side, but the leading edge instead went in the air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman leg glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a lofted leg glance in the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.|$|E

50|$|The {{key to the}} Grip Pod is {{the button}} {{near the top of}} the grip. This button connects to a {{spring-loaded}} sliding piston in the grip, that sits atop <b>the</b> bi-pod <b>legs.</b> When <b>the</b> button is pressed, the spring is released and decompressed, which pushes the piston down. This action expands <b>the</b> two housed <b>legs</b> out of <b>the</b> grip and into their locked and spread position. <b>The</b> <b>legs</b> are connected to each other by a joint that is fastened by a pin with threading on one end, called a pivot pin. A torsion spring, similar to those used in mousetraps, allows <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>the</b> tension to expand outward, assuming their locked position. A rubber O-ring is in place at the bottom of the grip to catch a ledge at the top of <b>the</b> bi-pod <b>leg</b> mechanism. This prevents <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> from over-extending or leaving the grip completely. The grips are mainly made from reinforced polymer, while <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are stainless steel covered by polymer. Each Grip Pod is 5.75 inches long with <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> concealed, and 7.25 inches long with <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> deployed. <b>The</b> Grip Pod mounts to a weapon using the Picatinny Rail system.|$|R
5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl {{the ball at}} <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> stump or for batsmen to hit on <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used leg theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed on that side of the field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in county cricket.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E
