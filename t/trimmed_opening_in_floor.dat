50|$|In 1988 the {{building}} was sold and converted into a nightclub. Changes to {{the building}} fabric included {{the addition of a}} lift to the tower; additions to the northern side of the building housing basement store and car park, escape stairs, toilets and a stage; and additions to the western side against Knapp Street including an entry court, beer garden and perimeter wall. Most of these additions were constructed of rendered concrete block. Shutters shown in early drawings have been replaced with fixed glass. Many changes have been made to the interior of the building including installation of air conditioning, fixtures associated with the nightclub, new stairs and <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> <b>floors</b> and masonry walls. In 2010 the building operates as a live music and entertainment venue.|$|R
50|$|Pivot hinges: which pivot <b>in</b> <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> {{and the top}} of {{the door}} frame. Also {{referred}} to as a double-acting floor hinge. This type is found in ancient dry stone buildings and rarely in old wooden buildings. These are also called haar-hung doors. They are a low cost alternative for use light weight doors.|$|R
5000|$|A {{second round}} of renovations began in 1983, the most {{important}} additions of which were {{the building of a}} large cruciform <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> of the second storey and the installation of a lighting grid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{provision}} of transverse <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> <b>floor</b> beams {{to facilitate the}} passage of utility pipes and service ducts results not only in a more systematic layout of pipes and ducts, it also translates into substantial economic savings {{in the construction of}} a multi-storey building. To investigate the problem of <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> beams, the author initiated a research program in the early 1980 s. Since then extensive research has been carried out giving a comprehensive coverage on both circular and large rectangular openings under various combinations of bending, shear and torsion. In this paper, major findings relevant to the analysis and design of such beams under the most commonly encountered loading case of bending and shear are extracted and summarized. An attempt has been made to answer the frequently asked questions related to creating an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> an already constructed beam and how to deal with multiple openings. It has been shown that the design method for beams with large openings can be further simplified without sacrificing rationality and having unreasonable additional cost...|$|R
40|$|Ruptured {{pulmonary}} hydatid cyst {{may sometimes}} cause complications like empyema, bronchopleural fistula, and collapsed lung. These complications may mislead {{the diagnosis and}} treatment if prior evidence of cyst has not been documented before rupture. We present {{a case of a}} young male who presented with complete collapse of left lung with pyopneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula which was misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis. He was referred to us from peripheral hospital for pneumonectomy when his condition did not improve after six months of antitubercular chemotherapy and intercostals drainage. On investigation, CT scan revealed significant pleural thickening and massive pneumothorax restricting lung expansion. Decortication of thickened parietal and visceral pleura revealed a ruptured hydatid endocyst, and repair of leaking bronchial <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> <b>floor</b> of probable site of rupture in left upper lobe helped in the complete expansion of the collapsed lung followed by uneventful recovery...|$|R
2500|$|In {{many cases}} {{the mouth of the}} sendō was sealed by a wooden door (...) , the remains of which can {{sometimes}} still be seen. In some cases, cremated bones were interred <b>in</b> an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor,</b> but <b>in</b> other tombs there is instead urn. In either case, yagura floors are part of the bedrock, so are not suitable for burials. [...] Fragments of cremated bone can occasionally be found.|$|R
50|$|Males have subgular vocal sacs with a slit-like <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> of the mouth. Female Ansonia echinata are unknown. Hertwig {{and colleagues}} discuss the {{possibility}} that Ansonia vidua, known only from two female specimens, could be conspecific with Ansonia echinata. Based on morphological and ecological differences, they conclude that the two are separate species, although lack of tissue samples from A. echinata means that this question could not be settled with molecular methods.|$|R
60|$|Martin looked round reflectively. In {{the centre}} of the {{courtyard}} stood a building not unlike a pigeon-house, or the shelter that is sometimes set {{up in the middle of}} a market beneath which merchants gather. In fact it was a shot tower, where leaden bullets of different sizes were cast and dropped through an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> into a shallow tank below to cool, for this was part of the trade of the foundry.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{saw another}} {{place in a}} room beyond, which was in some respects still more dreadful than this. It {{was a place where}} there was an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor,</b> near the wall of the room, that looked like a trap door. There was the {{beginning}} of a stone stair leading down. A small railing was built round the opening, as if to keep people from falling in. The boys all crowded round the railing, and looked down.|$|R

50|$|Walpole Town Hall is a {{historic}} town hall building at 972 Main Street in Walpole, Massachusetts, USA. The two-story brick building was designed by J. Williams Beal and completed in 1881.

During cold weather the carriage air could be routed via the resistance to heat it, and warm and cold air could be mixed at various levels. As there was no resistance in the trailers, these were equipped with electric heaters. The trams had a 24-volt lighting system with cabin lighting from fluorescent lamps.|$|R
50|$|A large barn {{is often}} {{central to the}} barnyard, storing farm equipment, and {{providing}} stalls for the farm animals. In traditional designs, a hayloft often occupies the second floor, and a barn cupola caps off the hayloft. In some barns, the loft has a series of <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> just above the stalls to send hay into the mangers below. In some places, the barn houses a corn crib and a corn sheller. Feed storage, however, is also a boon to mice and rats, so farmers often keep barn cats to control vermin.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} {{is divided into}} three rooms with exposed stud timber partition walls lined to door head height. The two smaller interconnecting rooms {{at the front of the}} building are separated by a chamferboard-lined wall. A weatherboard-lined wall separates these from the larger room at the rear. There is a timber floor throughout supported on joists housed into log bearers. Access to the cement-rendered cellar is gained through an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> a front room via a metal ladder. The cellar is ventilated with <b>openings</b> formed <b>in</b> brickwork in each of the corners, although the exterior openings were not located.
