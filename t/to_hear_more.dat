25|$|A {{hearing aid}} or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is {{designed}} to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.|$|E

Their girlfriends ask <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more,</b> so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed.

[...] The taste for titillating accounts was also cultivated by Junimea members, who discreetly signaled their wish <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> explicit content by asking Creangă to recount stories from [...] "the wide street".

The Phantom Tollbooth's Andy Argyrakis stated that Hudson having been reared in church had [...] "paid off", and noted that [...] "Although a mere pop lightweight, it's hard to ignore Hudson's sincerity and lyrical maturity." [...] DEP from Billboard, also calling Hudson a talent, classified the record as [...] "textured modern-rock collection that is equal parts grit and vulnerability" [...] and [...] "impressive". The album was a commercial failure for bankrupted Red Hill Records, only selling between 100 and 200 copies.|$|E

500|$|In April 1907, Rimsky-Korsakov {{conducted}} {{a pair of}} concerts in Paris, hosted by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, which featured music of the Russian nationalist school. The concerts were hugely successful in popularizing Russian classical music of this kind in Europe, Rimsky-Korsakov's in particular. The following year, his opera Sadko was produced at the Paris Opéra and The Snow Maiden at the Opéra-Comique. He also had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> recent music by European composers. He hissed unabashedly when he heard Richard Strauss's opera Salome, and told Diaghilev after hearing Claude Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande, [...] "Don't make me listen to all these horrors or I shall end up liking them!" [...] Hearing these works led him to appreciate {{his place in the}} world of classical music.

500|$|Elephants {{are known}} to {{communicate}} with seismics, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; {{this is known as}} the [...] "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in marine mammals like toothed whales and sirenians. A unique sphincter-like muscle around the ear canal constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> seismic signals. Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances. When detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators, elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. Seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to [...] while those from vocalisations travel [...]|$|E

Orlando called Joan [...] "a real piece of work" [...] saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body. She added that Joan was [...] "cold" [...] saying this adding, [...] "I suddenly understood why Megan avoids Mom like the plague". Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> than two or three words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E

500|$|Heather Phares of Allmusic {{rated the}} album 3 out of 5 stars and commented, [...] "her voice is {{pleasant}} enough, but it's not especially distinctive, and she's not {{helped by a}} batch of songs that aren't nearly as charming as High School Musicals tunes." [...] Phares also said that although the album wasn't winning considering the high-profile songwriters and producers involved, [...] "it's fine for anyone who just wants <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of Ashley Tisdale's -- and not Sharpay Evans' -- singing." [...] Jon Dolan of Blender said Tisdale did not import her [...] "spunky" [...] High School Musical character in the album, and that even {{with the quality of}} producers, [...] "no stylistic slipper fits right." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said Tisdale went, [...] "the contemporary CHR school of fellow Mouse products Britney Spears and first-album Christina Aguilera—lots of synthesizer-laden, beat-heavy, layered-vocal dance tracks" [...] that varied between [...] "come-hithers" [...] and [...] "self-affirming anthems." [...] Graff commented, [...] "she'll have to develop a more defined identity before she can truly win our affections." [...] James Ross of The Arizona Daily Wildcat commended the album's uptempo songs but critiqued the ballads, commenting she hits the right notes on uptempo numbers, while on ballads, [...] "Any 'Musical' fan knows that Tisdale can belt one out, but this is not apparent on the album." [...] Overall, Ross said, [...] "Although the album fails in places, it is ll [...] a worthy attempt by an up-and-coming pop artist to please her audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{disliked the}} UK cover of Are You Experienced, so {{arrangements}} {{were made for}} a photo shoot with graphic designer Karl Ferris. Hendrix wanted [...] "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release Evolution. During {{a meeting with the}} band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, Axis: Bold as Love. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with Are You Experienced he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was [...] "so far out that it seemed to come from outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a [...] "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." [...] With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a fisheye lens which was then popular in Mod sub-culture. Ferris used what Egan described as [...] "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King's Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of Are You Experienced was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.|$|E
