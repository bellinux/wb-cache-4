5000|$|While Jimmy and Kim {{celebrate}} the verdict at Wexler-McGill, Rebecca drops by the office, {{hoping to get}} Jimmy <b>to</b> have <b>Chuck</b> <b>open</b> his door. He refuses to get involved, and when Rebecca says that Jimmy lied to her about wanting <b>to</b> help <b>Chuck,</b> he coldly says that he told the truth about Chuck having problems and needing her help and that's {{all he wanted to}} say. Rebecca says Chuck is Jimmy's brother and Jimmy says [...] "Not anymore, he's not." [...] Rebecca angrily says Chuck was right about Jimmy and leaves after bitterly telling him and Kim to [...] "enjoy your champagne". Jimmy isn't moved by this but Kim looks upset.|$|R
50|$|While Sarah {{is on the}} road, {{her search}} of Stephen Bartowski concludes, and she decides to return {{immediately}} to Burbank <b>to</b> tell <b>Chuck</b> what she has found. She arrives after Chuck has been abducted {{and is about to}} leave him a note when she sees his phone lying on his bed. Sarah immediately returns to Castle but her access has been revoked. She signals Casey and warns him that Chuck is missing. Forrest attempts to overrule her because his watch's GPS transponder places him in his apartment's courtyard. Sarah activates their surveillance cameras: his watch is {{at the bottom of the}} fountain. The three track them to a bank vault, which Zamir is using to shield the bug while forcing Chuck (whom he believes is Devon) to operate and remove it. <b>Chuck</b> tries <b>to</b> stall, but his identity is revealed and Zamir tries to kill him, knocking over a tank of nitrous which Casey sees as they arrive at the vault shortly before Zamir seals the door. Forrest wants to blow the vault open, but the blast could ignite the nitrous, killing Chuck. Sarah works on cracking the lock while the others try <b>to</b> get <b>Chuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the door. <b>Chuck</b> and Zamir get high on the gas, and in their inebriated state <b>Chuck</b> gets Zamir <b>to</b> confess where the terrorists are located. Sarah succeeds in opening the vault and rescues Chuck.|$|R
5000|$|At the rendezvous, Vincent threatens <b>to</b> kill <b>Chuck's</b> family, forcing <b>Chuck</b> <b>to</b> tell Orion {{that he is}} safe.

50|$|<b>Chuck</b> <b>opens</b> {{the trunk}} of the Rolls-Royce, takes Morgan's snoring body back to the Buy More and {{explains}} that he fainted. Morgan apologizes <b>to</b> <b>Chuck</b> for his attitude, and they make peace. Sarah, Casey and Chuck learn from Beckman that the whole Triad group was taken into custody, including Jason. The ambassador is left with a renewed vigor to crack down on Triad activities in the United States and overseas.

5000|$|On his {{birthday}} in 2007, <b>Chuck</b> <b>opens</b> {{an email from}} Bryce Larkin that causes <b>Chuck</b> <b>to</b> download into his brain the full contents of a CIA/NSA supercomputer known as the Intersect, which {{has served as a}} database for their combined collected intelligence. Unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>Chuck,</b> the Intersect computer has been destroyed, making his brain the only location of this top-secret information. The government learns that Chuck Bartowski was the last known person that Bryce Larkin contacted, so both the CIA and NSA (independent of each other) send agents to find him. The CIA dispatches field officer Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) to retrieve a copy of the Intersect, while the NSA sends then-Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin) <b>to</b> capture <b>Chuck.</b> The two agents eventually cross paths, and Sarah fends off Casey. They then discover that Chuck is a human version of the Intersect who sees a rapid-fire series of images (or [...] "flashes") of intelligence from the Intersect database whenever his brain recognizes a bit of related information with his own eyes or ears. The two agencies conclude that Chuck must be protected and assign Sarah and Casey jointly to the task.|$|R

After Leader falls over one of Big Mike's trip wires, Casey starts fighting him while Sarah looks for Jill. Leader defeats Casey but is knocked out by Big Mike, who came back from his fishing trip after Jeff tripped over a wire earlier.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of allusions to The Matrix in this episode. Orion's {{communication}} with Chuck via computer screens is similar to when Morpheus first contacts Neo in his bedroom, such as when Chuck's search of the Internet is interrupted by Orion. There are some musical clues, such as when Vincent is about <b>to</b> shoot <b>Chuck,</b> and audio clues, as when <b>Chuck</b> <b>opens</b> the laptop sent to him by Orion, that are very similar to the music and sounds used in The Matrix. Chuck's phone conversation with Orion and his plan to escape the agents guarding the area is reminiscent of Neo's conversation with Morpheus at his work. The comic book <b>Chuck</b> appears <b>to</b> read {{at the end of this}} episode to hide his Intersect research is titled [...] "Ex Machina" [...] - which is Latin for [...] "out of the machine".|$|R
