5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> {{had in the}} previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, and Europeans from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the Allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division <b>than</b> <b>they</b> did, and that the attack would be in the south.

5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material <b>than</b> <b>they</b> actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often <b>than</b> <b>they</b> did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together.

Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan.
