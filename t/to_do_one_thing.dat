Also that year, she had major roles in the films Certain Women and Manchester by the Sea, both of which premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Manchester in particular earned her wide praise, with film critic Tom Shone saying, [...] "If this actress were put on earth <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> only, it would be this." [...] Williams received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress for both performances.

Author Barrie Dolnick adds that [...] "people don't want to learn how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> They'll {{take a little bit of}} Buddhism, a little bit of veganism, a little bit of astrology...

2500|$|Then Hazlitt {{comments}} {{on the nature of}} Wordsworth's taste in art and his interest in and judgements of artists and earlier poets. His tastes show the elevation of his style, but also the narrowness of his focus. Wordsworth's artistic sympathies are with Poussin and Rembrandt, showing an affinity for the same subjects. Like Rembrandt, he invests [...] "the minute details of nature with an atmosphere of sentiment". Wordsworth has little sympathy with Shakespeare. Related to this, asserts Hazlitt, is the undramatic nature of Wordsworth's own poetry. This {{is the result of a}} character flaw, egotism. He regrets his own harsh criticism [...] of a few years earlier, but still maintains that Wordsworth's egotism, narrowing the range of his interests, restricts his literary achievement. And yet, Hazlitt reflects, as is frequently the case with men of genius, an egotistic narrowness is often found together with an ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> supremely well.|$|E

One of the principal differences between Harmonic Serialism and standard Optimality Theory is that Harmonic Serialism 2 ̆ 7 s Gen is limited <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at a time.
