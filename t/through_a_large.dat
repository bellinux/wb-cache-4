5|$|In particular, {{intelligence}} gathering {{played a major}} role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were involved in gathering intelligence on German military installations and troop movements and communicating {{it back to the}} Allied armies. The organization was run <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of independent groups and included, notably, the large Dame Blanche (White Lady) network. Alongside {{intelligence gathering}} were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the Belgian Army on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E

5|$|After almost 22 {{months of}} construction, {{the road was}} opened {{for a day of}} free travel on October 20, 1956 between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. An {{estimated}} 12,000 to 15,000 cars traveled on the turnpike. Many of those motorists traveled to Lawrence for a football game between the University of Kansas and University of Oklahoma. Official opening ceremonies were held at interchanges {{in each of the three}} major cities on October 25. The Kansas City celebration included Gene Autry jumping his horse <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> paper map of the turnpike. John Masefield, the British Poet Laureate, wrote a tribute to commemorate the occasion. On the first day after the official opening, 7,197 vehicles traveled the turnpike, with 81 toll collectors and 50 maintenance workers on duty. The turnpike originally had 14 interchanges; by 2012, there were 22.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} from East Lenox, PA106 continues southeastward through {{fields and}} soon into {{a region of}} residences. The southeastern stretch continues for several miles into the community of West Clifford. There, PA106 passes some homes and intersects with PA374. The two designations become concurrent, paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford. PA106 and PA374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry, until clearing into the community of Royal. In the small community, PA106 and PA374 fork, with PA374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA106 heading southeastward through Royal. PA106 continues further, entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal. At the intersection with Cemetery Road, the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford. There, the route crosses <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> residential and commercial community, intersecting with State Route2008 (SR2008). The route continues southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County.|$|E

5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E
5|$|During their {{approach}} to Guadalcanal, the Japanese force passed <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> and intense rain squall which, along with a complex formation plus some confusing orders from Abe, split the formation into several groups. The U.S. force steamed in a single column in Ironbottom Sound, with destroyers in the lead and rear of the column, and the cruisers in the center. Five ships had the new, far-superior SG radar, but Callaghan's deployment put none {{of them in the}} forward part of the column, nor did he choose one for his flagship. Callaghan did not issue a battle plan to his ship commanders.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Washington left on {{his third}} trip, to the South, largely to promote {{national}} unity amid uproar over Hamilton's economic plan, as well as slavery. The trip began on March 20, 1791, when Washington and {{a small group of}} aides began sailing down the Severn River. After sailing <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> storm, they arrived in Annapolis. From Annapolis he traveled to Mount Vernon, and from there to Colchester, Virginia, to Richmond, Virginia. After leaving Richmond, he went to Petersburg, than Emporia, Virginia. He left Virginia and went to Craven County, North Carolina, then New Bern. Washington's last stop in North Carolina was Wilmington, which upon leaving he promptly arrived in Georgetown, South Carolina, subsequently travelling to Charleston. After South Carolina, Washington arrived in Georgia, going to (among others) Augusta. In late May, Washington turned around, stopping at many Revolutionary War battle sites. On July 11, 1791, they arrived back at Mount Vernon.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Native Americans living along the Columbia River as early as 10,000years ago visited the Bull Run {{watershed}} in search of food. Within the past few thousand years they created trails over the Cascade Range and around Mount Hood, near {{the upper part of}} the Bull Run watershed. By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains from east to west to reach the fertile Willamette Valley. In the 1890s, the City of Portland, searching for sources of clean drinking water, chose the Bull Run River. Dam-building, road construction, and legal action to protect the watershed began shortly thereafter, and Bull Run water began to flow <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> pipe to the city in 1895.|$|E

Modern skyscrapers are difficult and expensive to construct in Los Angeles due to the city's high rate of earthquakes and position near the San Andreas fault line, {{as well as the}} resulting difficulty of adhering to the city's rigorous engineering standards. Nevertheless, a number of successful and iconic skyscrapers dot the Los Angeles skyline from Downtown Los Angeles through Koreatown.

From there, NY454 continues eastward through a residential district for several miles and passes {{to the south}} of Whitman Hollow Park. The arterial continues southeastward through local residential areas with four lanes before meeting NY347 and the Northern State Parkway at an interchange in Hauppauge. The junction serves as the western terminus of NY347 and the eastern terminus of the Northern Parkway. NY347 and NY454 become concurrent, crossing through Hauppauge and residential properties for the next two miles (3.2km), intersecting with local roads. After bending around Forestwood Park, Routes454 and 347 follow the town line and pass the Stoubrough Golf Course, where NY347 forks to the northeast.|$|E
