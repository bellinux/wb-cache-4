5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E

500|$|In {{the light}} of how {{surprising}} the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the European Association of Experimental Social Psychology in 1984, followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected. Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect [...] "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artifact". Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was spurious, but they doubted its psychological relevance. In {{the first five years}} after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university (Ohio State University, where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).|$|E
500|$|Lane has {{breakfast with}} a member of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, who praises his fiscal track record and asks him to serve as head of the association's fiscal control committee. He accepts. Examining the company {{financial}} records, Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) finds Lane's forged check and accuses Don of giving an unauthorized Christmas bonus. Don calls Lane into his office, shows him the check and serves him a drink. Lane pretends to be ignorant at first, but then apologizes while arguing that he was only taking his own money that he had previously invested and for which he had not been compensated. Don demands his resignation and gives him the weekend to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> [...] "elegant exit", assuring him that this is the worst part of starting over. Lane wanders over to Joan's (Christina Hendricks) office with the drink still in his hand, but she [...] sends him away after he makes a lewd comment.|$|E
500|$|Since the Mass Effect {{series was}} envisioned as a trilogy from its inception, work on Mass Effect 2 started {{shortly before the}} {{original}} Mass Effect was released. The game was initially developed exclusively for the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 platforms with {{the same level of}} dedication. As a result, each version of the game features different user interfaces and controls. Like its predecessor, Mass Effect 2 was built using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 in conjunction with a framework that BioWare specifically developed for the Mass Effect games. As most of these Mass Effect technologies were already developed in the first game, the development team focused on adding a lot of new content and perfecting new features rather than creating them from scratch. Technical improvements included better memory management, greater textures, a higher frame rate, and better lighting scenarios. According to Hudson, [...] "I actually can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aspect of the game that we haven't overhauled and made 100% better." ...|$|E

500|$|Yankovic {{noted that}} his usual method of {{generating}} parody ideas is to scan Billboard charts, radio play and online buzz {{in order to}} create a master list of candidates. From that point, he works out possible puns on the song titles, the potential for humor and general direction for his versions. Fans speculated ahead of the album's release that Yankovic would parody [...] "Let It Go" [...] from the Disney film Frozen, due to the song's popularity. He later explained that he considered making a Frozen parody titled [...] "Make It So" [...] about , but decided not to after discovering such a parody already existed. Yankovic observed that the existing spoof [...] "had gotten enough attention online to make the Disney legal department ask them to take it down! I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea that I liked as much as 'Make It So', so... I gave up!". There were several other songs he intended to parody, but felt he was unable to develop a clever enough idea for, and instead used them in the medley [...] "Now That's What I Call Polka". More specifically, Yankovic expressed that while Daft Punk's [...] "Get Lucky" [...] is an [...] "iconic song", it was too repetitive for him to incorporate new lyrics into effectively.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Toriyama {{said that}} by {{the second half of}} the series, he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than drawing it, and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines. He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become [...] "too square", so he intentionally made it more so. Years later he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborately, suggesting that he was not interested in the art. As the manga progressed, he struggled with the Android and Cell arc, feeling that the manga could not outdo the Freeza arc. He added time travel, but said he had a hard time with the plot, only being able to think of what to do that week. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind. Even after the Cell arc, Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Majin Boo arc. Having resolved it would be the finale, he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan's Great Saiyaman persona and the character Gotenks. However, he did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ending until the final chapter. At the time, Toriyama said he gave Dragon Ball a low-key ending to make it seem as if the story might continue. But would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end. Wanting to make it clear that Goku's battles were over, and a new generation was taking over, Toriyama added a message to the ending for the kanzenban re-release of Dragon Ball which finished in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|One {{can also}} define abelian {{varieties}} scheme-theoretically and [...] {{relative to a}} base.

An abelian scheme over a base scheme S of relative dimension g is a proper, smooth group scheme over S whose geometric fibers are connected and of dimension g. The fibers of an abelian scheme are abelian varieties, so one could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> abelian scheme over S as being a family of abelian varieties parametrised byS.|$|E

In this example, X is the random variable whose outcome is k, the number of green marbles actually drawn in the experiment. This situation is illustrated by the following contingency table: ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Wright sought a new weekend sport to replace baseball.

With no formal training, he wrestled (and lost) his first match on December 4, 1993, under a mask as [...] "El Chico". While wrestling on the independent circuit, Wright was approached by Pat and Rocky Anderson, who complimented him on his skills and appearance and offered him membership in the apocryphal Anderson family. Anderson spent two weeks trying to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> appropriate forename, eventually settling on his initials, C.W., at the suggestion of an interviewer; he thus became C.W. Anderson. Anderson later met Ole Anderson but claimed that he was disillusioned by the experience. Anderson formed a tag team with Pat Anderson, winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship with him in 1996.|$|E
