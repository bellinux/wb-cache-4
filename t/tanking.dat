25|$|A second launch {{attempt was}} made on 17 June 2009 for which NASA moved the planned launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to a new date. On 17 June 2009 loading of the shuttle's {{external}} tank with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen was delayed three hours due to poor weather around the launch site, but <b>tanking</b> began once the weather cleared. Approximately two hours after <b>tanking</b> began, engineers saw leak indications in the GUCP similar to those seen during the first launch attempt. The launch was officially scrubbed at 01:55 EDT.|$|E
25|$|Unexplained, {{erroneous}} {{readings from}} fuel depletion sensors have delayed several shuttle launch attempts, most notably STS-122. On 2007-12-18 a <b>tanking</b> test determined {{the cause of}} the errors to be a fault in a wiring connector, rather than a failure of the sensors themselves.|$|E
25|$|While {{each class}} in The Old Republic favors a certain play style (ranged/melee damage, healing or support skills, or <b>tanking),</b> {{customization}} combined with companion characters {{allow for a}} class {{to be able to}} tackle many different situations, with or without the support of other player characters, and without requiring specific other classes in order to move forward.|$|E
50|$|Mud <b>tanks</b> are an {{important}} part in the solids control system. Based on functions, mud <b>tanks</b> include metering <b>tanks,</b> circulating <b>tanks,</b> chemical <b>tanks,</b> aggravating <b>tanks,</b> precipitating <b>tanks,</b> storing <b>tanks,</b> etc.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tanks</b> {{were also}} {{classified}} by roles that were independent of size, such as cavalry <b>tank,</b> cruiser <b>tank,</b> fast <b>tank,</b> infantry <b>tank,</b> <b>tank</b> destroyer, [...] "assault" [...] <b>tank,</b> or [...] "breakthrough" [...] <b>tank.</b> Military theorists initially tended to assign <b>tanks</b> to traditional military infantry, cavalry, and artillery roles, but later developed more specialized roles unique to <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As <b>tank</b> {{doctrine}} developed, {{the role}} of <b>tanks</b> started to be defined. Initially based on naval ideas, in late 1916 Captain Giffard Le Quesne Martel (later Major General Sir) proposed a <b>tank</b> army formed of Destroyer <b>tanks,</b> Battle <b>tanks</b> (of Heavy, Medium and Light types), Torpedo <b>tanks</b> (utilising large trench mortars), Engineer <b>tanks,</b> Supply <b>tanks</b> and Ambulance <b>tanks</b> ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the last}} round robin match of the week on Friday night, Victoria Azarenka took on {{alternate}} Marion Bartoli. The result, a 5–7, 6–4, 6–4 win for Bartoli, {{had no effect on}} either group's standings. However, Azarenka was accused of <b>tanking</b> the final set of the match, going for winners at the get go and not willing to track down balls.|$|E
25|$|Atlantiss {{external}} {{tank for}} the STS-135 mission was put through a <b>tanking</b> test on 15 June 2011 {{to check the}} health of the tank's stringers. It was slightly delayed due to a lightning storm which passed over the Kennedy Space Center. During the test, technicians detected a hydrogen fuel valve leak in Atlantiss main engine No. 3, as it recorded temperatures below normal levels. The leaking hydrogen valve was replaced on 21 June.|$|E
25|$|The second launch {{attempt on}} 17 June 2009 was also {{scrubbed}} due to hydrogen leak issues {{seen from the}} Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate. Due to conflicts with {{the launch of the}} LRO, and due to a beta angle constraint, the next available launch opportunity was scheduled for 11 July 2009. A successful <b>tanking</b> test for leak checks was performed on 1 July 2009, with modified GUCP seals allowing launch preparations to proceed as scheduled. Because of lightning strikes near the launch pad during the evening of 10 July 2009, NASA scrubbed the launch for the third time and rescheduled for 12 July 2009. Due to a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) weather violation, NASA scrubbed the launch for the fourth time on the evening of 12 July 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the Soviet <b>tank</b> strength still lay in separate <b>tank</b> brigades that directly supported the infantry. 30th Army started the offensive with nine <b>tank</b> brigades with 390 <b>tanks,</b> 31st Army had six <b>tank</b> brigades with 274 <b>tanks,</b> and 20th Army had five <b>tank</b> brigades and 255 <b>tanks.</b> Behind these army-level forces were newly created <b>tank</b> corps, the 6th and 8th {{to the rear of}} 20th Army, and 5th <b>Tank</b> Corps behind 33rd Army.|$|R
5000|$|The cruiser <b>tank</b> (also called cavalry <b>tank</b> or fast <b>tank)</b> was a British <b>tank</b> {{concept of}} the interwar period for <b>tanks</b> {{designed}} to function as modernised armoured and mechanised cavalry. Cruiser <b>tanks</b> were developed after the Royal Armoured Corps were not satisfied {{with many of the}} medium <b>tank</b> designs of the 1930s. The cruiser <b>tank</b> concept was conceived by Giffard Le Quesne Martel, who preferred many small light <b>tanks</b> to swarm to enemy, instead of a few expensive medium <b>tanks.</b> There were two main types of cruiser <b>tanks,</b> [...] "light" [...] cruiser <b>tanks</b> and [...] "heavy" [...] cruiser <b>tanks.</b> [...] "Light" [...] cruiser <b>tanks</b> were lightly armoured and relatively fast (for example, the Cruiser Mk I), while [...] "heavy" [...] cruiser <b>tanks</b> were more heavily armoured and slightly slower than [...] "light" [...] cruiser <b>tanks</b> (for example, the Cruiser Mk II).|$|R
50|$|T {{indicates}} a <b>tank</b> locomotive: in European practice, this is sometimes extended {{to indicate the}} type of <b>tank</b> locomotive: T means side <b>tank,</b> PT pannier <b>tank,</b> ST saddle <b>tank,</b> WT well <b>tank.</b> T+T means a <b>tank</b> locomotive that also has a tender.|$|R
25|$|The launch {{countdown}} began 10 June 2009, but on 13 June 2009, as <b>tanking</b> was underway, a {{gaseous hydrogen}} leak on a vent line near the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate was observed, and the 13 June 2009 launch was scrubbed at 00:26 EDT. As liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped in, {{some of it}} boils off as the extremely cold liquid enters the warm external tank. The vent line valve controls the resulting buildup of gas pressure by allowing excess gas to escape into a ground-side vent line, {{which leads to a}} flare stack at a safe distance away from the pad. A similar leak situation was seen during the first launch attempt of STS-119. NASA managers met on 14 June 2009 and 15 June 2009 and evaluated the leak, discussed steps that had to be taken, and set a new launch date of 17 June 2009, at 05:40 EDT.|$|E
500|$|From 2 to 5 August 2013, two MV-22s {{completed}} the longest distance Osprey <b>tanking</b> mission to date. Flying from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa alongside two KC-130J tanker aircraft, the Ospreys flew to Clark Air Base in the Philippines on 2 August, then to Darwin, Australia on 3 August, Townsville, Australia on 4 August, and finally rendezvoused with [...] on 5 August.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, most MMOGs {{require some}} degree of {{teamwork}} {{in parts of the}} game. These tasks usually require players to take on roles in the group, such as protecting other players from damage (called <b>tanking),</b> [...] "healing" [...] damage done to other players or damaging enemies.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, many <b>tank</b> {{concepts}} {{were found}} unsatisfactory and discarded, mostly leaving the more multi-role tanks; these became easier to classify. <b>Tank</b> classes based on weight (and the corresponding transport and logistical needs) led to new definitions of heavy and light <b>tank</b> classes, with medium <b>tanks</b> covering {{the balance of}} those between. The British maintained cruiser <b>tanks,</b> focused on speed, and infantry <b>tanks</b> that traded speed for more armour and firepower. <b>Tank</b> destroyers are <b>tanks</b> or other armoured fighting vehicles specifically designed to defeat enemy <b>tanks.</b> Assault guns are armored fighting vehicles that could combine the roles of infantry <b>tanks</b> and <b>tank</b> destroyers. As the war went on, <b>tanks</b> tended to become larger and more powerful, shifting some <b>tank</b> classifications and leading to super-heavy <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Aerial refueling, [...] also {{referred}} to as air refueling, in-flight refueling (IFR), air-to-air refueling (AAR), and <b>tanking,</b> is the process of transferring aviation fuel from one military aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver) during flight. The two main refueling systems are probe-and-drogue, which is simpler to adapt to existing aircraft, and the flying boom, which offers faster fuel transfer, but requires a dedicated boom operator station.|$|E
2500|$|The MMT again met at 04:30 EST on November 16, 2009 {{and gave}} a [...] "go" [...] to begin loading shuttle Atlantis’ {{external}} tank. The <b>tanking</b> began at 05:03 EST and was completed at 08:00 EST. The final unanimous [...] "go" [...] for launch directive from the mission management team, mission control and the launch team came during the countdown clock holding at T-9 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Endeavour {{lifted off}} from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39 at 08:56 EDT on 16 May 2011. The launch of Endeavour came after an on-time <b>tanking</b> process which filled the shuttle's {{external}} tank {{with more than}} [...] of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen; the <b>tanking</b> started at 23:36 EDT on 15 May 2011. Once the shuttle and crew were on-orbit, they set about preparing the shuttle for the mission ahead. The first tasks they completed were opening the payload bay doors, activating the Ku-band antenna, and activating the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), {{also known as the}} Canadarm. Prior to this, commander Mark Kelly and pilot Greg Johnson completed an engine firing, known as the OMS-2 burn, to circularize the orbit of the shuttle. They also completed another engine firing, the NC-1 burn, to help the shuttle catch up to the International Space Station (ISS). After completing these initial tasks, the crew activated the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, allowing it to be monitored by teams on the ground. Later in the crew's work day, they downlinked video recordings that had been shot of the external tank by mission specialist Mike Fincke.|$|E

2500|$|Mastic asphalt {{is a type}} {{of asphalt}} that differs from dense graded asphalt (asphalt concrete) in that it has a higher asphalt (binder) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole {{aggregate}} mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% asphalt. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and <b>tanking</b> underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of [...] and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about [...] thick.|$|E
2500|$|After STS-4, {{several hundred}} pounds were {{eliminated}} by deleting the anti-geyser line. This line paralleled the oxygen feed line, providing a circulation path for liquid oxygen. This reduces accumulation of gaseous {{oxygen in the}} feed line during prelaunch <b>tanking</b> (loading of the LOX). After propellant loading data from ground tests and the first few space shuttle missions were assessed, the anti-geyser line was removed for subsequent missions. The total length and diameter of the ET remain unchanged. The last SWT, flown on STS-7, weighed approximately [...] inert.|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{possible}} for a Guardian (traditional <b>tanking</b> class) to ride the heavy Destrier steed, traited for Riddermark, and position him-/herself in Red Dawn stance. The Destrier steed would help the Guardian's survivability, the Red Dawn stance would allow the Guardian to inflict substantial (but not spectacular) damage, and the Riddermark traits would grant the mounted Guardian abilities that may not necessarily amplify either survivability or damage potential, but would bring yet a third component to bear against his/her enemies. [...] The steed/stance/traits {{do not have to}} match (although, in some cases, it is advantageous to do so).|$|E

2500|$|On 31 July 2012, the AFL's Integrity Officer, Brett Clothier, {{announced}} a full investigation into Melbourne's 2009 season regarding {{allegations that the}} Demons had [...] "tanked" [...] (set out to lose) games during the season to secure a priority draft-pick that year, available to clubs winning fewer than five games. Although the press had published such allegations previously, the investigation was prompted by specific statements from former player Brock McLean during a TV interview on On The Couch earlier in July 2012. Melbourne club officials, led by board chairman Don McLardy, vigorously denied the <b>tanking</b> allegations. The investigation lasted 203 days and Clothier interviewed over 50 people associated with the club. The AFL released its findings on 19 February 2013. Clothier effectively cleared Melbourne of <b>tanking,</b> stating [...] "there was no directive from the board and executive of the Melbourne Football Club to deliberately lose matches and that the club, coach and players did not deliberately set out to lose matches." [...] However, the investigation did establish a 'secret' meeting, known as [...] "The Vault", had taken place during 2009 at which club football manager Chris Connolly impressed upon then-coach Dean Bailey the desirability of procuring a priority draft pick. The AFL fined Melbourne $500,000 and suspended Connolly for one year from involvement in Melbourne's training and match-day duties and Bailey (subsequently an assistant coach of Adelaide) for 16 weeks from coaching duties, on the basis they had contravened rule 1.6 by [...] "acting in a manner prejudicial {{to the interests of}} the AFL." [...] Neither Melbourne, Connolly or Bailey contested these penalties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{level of}} {{blending}} above 10% (V/V) is chosen both from a technical (safety) perspective and {{to distinguish the}} product in Europe from regular unleaded petrol for reasons of taxes and customer clarity. Small-scale tests have shown many vehicles with modern engine types can run smoothly on this hydrous ethanol blend. Mixed <b>tanking</b> scenarios with anhydrous ethanol blends at 5% or 10% level do not induce phase separation. As avoiding mixing with E0, in particular at extremely low temperatures, in logistic systems and engines is not recommended, a separate specification for controlled usage is presented in a Netherlands Technical Agreement NTA 8115. The NTA 8115 is written for a worldwide application in trading and fuel blending.|$|E
