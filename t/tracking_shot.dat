5|$|The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car {{breaks down}} was added {{digitally}} in post-production. The filmmakers {{had not been}} granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene. When Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, {{the use of a}} <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass. The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a cherry picker from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E

The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, the first to employ automatic signalling, and the first to install an escalator.|$|E
25|$|Outdoors {{time-lapse}} photography {{presents a}} {{unique set of}} challenges: the varying light and temperatures in particular can cause many problems. To film bluebells under a canopy of beech trees, for example, cameraman Richard Kirby covered them with a thick canvas tent that was lit from within to simulate daylight. He then used a motion-controlled camera to obtain a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot,</b> moving it slightly after each exposure.|$|E

500|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File, a recent release {{at the time of}} shooting, Elliott decided to bring Fennell's script to life with the use of [...] "quirky visuals". As such, Elliott and his camera operator, Alan Perry, experimented with original angles and techniques, electing to introduce one scene with a long <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> and filming the characters using a mixture of live-action close-up shots and forced perspective. The music, on the other hand, is recycled from earlier Thunderbirds episodes.|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{decided to}} open the Glen Carrick Castle {{sequence}} with a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> covering all three walls of the puppet set, coordinating the necessary camera manoeuvres with camera operator Alan Perry. In a pioneering move for a Supermarionation production, forced perspective is used during this scene to present a live human hand and scale puppet characters within the same frame. While the hand, intended to belong to Southern, twiddles a pen in the foreground of the shot, the puppets of Kenyon and Dempsey are positioned across {{a table in the}} background. Although the puppets of Thunderbirds were sculpted in [...] human size, a visual illusion ensures that Kenyon and Dempsey appear to be accurately scaled in proportion to the hand.|$|E
500|$|Gracey {{refers to}} the film's {{cinematography}} as [...] "nothing short of astounding", and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento's [...] "passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals". Influenced by the penultimate shot in Antonioni's The Passenger (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer, one of Tenebraes main setpieces is {{the murder of the}} lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a Louma crane to film a several minutes-long <b>tracking</b> <b>shot.</b> Owing to its extreme length, the <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete. It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more. The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot. It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France. According to Gracey, the camera performs [...] "aerial gymnastics", scaling the victims' house in [...] "one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the penetrability of a seemingly secure home". Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later, {{at the time it was}} [...] "truly ground-breaking" [...] in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint. Patrick McAllister of Scifilm said the sequence should be considered [...] "one of the most memorable moments in cinema". According to McAllister, Tenebraes distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was [...] "meaningless". Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it [...] "meaninglessly brilliant".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> {{out of the bedroom}} and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} and we had a great time working out how to do it," [...] Joel said. [...] "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Islands" [...] {{was directed by}} Saam Farahmand, who had previously worked with artists like Simian Mobile Disco and Klaxons. It premiered on MTV on 21 April 2010. [...] Composed {{of a series of}} tracking shots, the video shows Croft, Sim, and Smith [...] "listlessly" [...] sitting on a couch with six dancers performing a choreographed dance routine behind them. The dancers carry out the same routine with every next <b>tracking</b> <b>shot,</b> but a slight change in their expressions, gestures, and movement takes place. Similarly, the band-members repeatedly change their positions and facial expressions [...] "with differing fervour". Near {{to the end of the}} video, the pattern begins modifying and [...] "the comfortable habits get broken up/break up" [...] as the dancers and band-members leave one by one. The backdrop, which consists of several small [...] "X" [...] letters, also catches fire.|$|E
500|$|Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon {{expected}} to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence {{was similar to}} a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers [...] "the heart of the experience" [...] and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the [...] "whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality {{of dealing with the}} crisis. Whedon used another long <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.|$|E
50|$|During filming, the director, David Elliot, did {{not always}} follow certain shots that Fennell had written into the script. Where many scenes had {{complicated}} <b>tracking</b> <b>shots,</b> Elliot simplified them with establishing shots.|$|R
2500|$|Arias’ {{angles and}} {{compositions}} are [...] inventive and striking, and most impressively, he incorporates {{a bevy of}} live action camera techniques: handheld framing, long <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> through corridors, rack focusing and shifting depths of field–that generate considerable immediacy and environmental realism (despite the obvious hand-drawn artifice). More than simple technological advances, these elements have long been untapped by feature animation due to their inability to be storyboarded – they’re traditional luxuries of live action spontaneity. For all the accolades bestowed upon Alfonso Cuarón’s digitally-composited <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> in Children of Men, Arias’ techniques here are arguably greater achievements.|$|R

500|$|Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} music [...] "very Chronicle", {{comparing}} the video to Max Landis' previous work. Rachel Paoletta of MTV News describes the music video as [...] "a decidedly darker and more badass video" [...] compared to her [...] "sexy, sultry, and sandy video for 'Love Me Harder'". She {{also stated that}} [...] "Ariana Grande's new video takes us {{to the end of}} the world, and brings us to the edge of our seats". In response to similarities between the Grande video and the music video accompanying Australian band SAFIA's single [...] "You Are the One", Grande and Landis were accused of intellectual property theft. The controversy centered on similarities in the shared apocalyptic themes and stylistic format (a single, <b>tracking</b> <b>shot)</b> as well as parallels in the beginning of both videos (where a female protagonist exits a vehicle despite the protests of the male driver) and final shot (a lover's embrace as the world comes to an end around them). Members of the band described the similarities as an instance of when [...] "big labels and/or big film firms steal ideas from small independent creatives who are trying really hard to make something different for a change". Despite acknowledging similarities between the two videos, Landis denied that his ideas are stolen from them and commented that both music videos had much in common with a third earlier music video by Perth group Injured Ninja.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{decided to}} make a short film {{documentary}} about boxer Walter Cartier, whom he had photographed and written about for Look magazine a year earlier. He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, Day of the Fight. [...] Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. [...] He had considered asking Montgomery Clift to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for Look, but settled on CBS news veteran Douglas Edwards. According to Paul Duncan the film was [...] "remarkably accomplished for a first film", and was notable for using the reverse <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> to film a scene in which the brothers walk towards the camera, a device later to become one of Kubrick's characteristic camera movements. Vincent Cartier, Walter's brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming. [...] He said, [...] "Stanley was very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts. He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way. Whatever he wanted, you complied, he just captivated you. Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted". [...] After a score was added by Singer's friend Gerald Fried, Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Pathé [...] for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time. [...] Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work, and he later declared that the [...] "best education in film is to make one".|$|E
500|$|Initially, True Detective {{first season}} {{was due to}} shoot in Arkansas, but Pizzolatto later chose to film in Louisiana to take {{advantage}} of state tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape: [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all...everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other hand you have the beauty of it all from a distance." [...] Principal photography took three months (between 100 and 110 days), from January to June 2013. Approximately five minutes of film were shot per day. Production staff constructed various set pieces, among them a scorched chapel, Joel Theriot's tent revival, and the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division offices, the last of which they built inside an abandoned light bulb warehouse near Elmwood. For the Dora Lange crime scene, the crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside Erath which, because it was partially burned, inspired what DiGerlando called a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for the corresponding interior scenes. The scene in which Cohle, taking Ginger hostage, escapes a housing complex amidst gunfire, was captured in Bridge City as a single six-minute <b>tracking</b> <b>shot,</b> a technique Fukunaga had employed in Sin Nombre (2009) and Jane Eyre (2011). Shot in seven takes, preparation for the scene was extensive and demanding: McConaughey trained with Mark Norby to master a fighting style for his character, {{and the nature of the}} shoot required a team of stunt coordinators, make-up artists, and special effects crew on hand during its entire course. Elsewhere, shooting took place at the old Kenner High School campus and nineteenth-century Fort Macomb, located outside New Orleans.|$|E
50|$|The show evolves quite rapidly, both {{visually}} and story-wise, {{given its}} half-hour format combined to a dramatic plot. The camera is at times nervous, at times fluid and often transitions through <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> of the city.|$|R
50|$|Much of the film's footage {{consists}} of long <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> filmed by cameraman Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein {{from the top}} of a Volkswagen camper van with Herzog driving. The crew smoothed out the road themselves to prepare the shots.|$|R
5000|$|Bowser and Musser also {{praise the}} film by stating, [...] "Maurice's {{innovative}} use of cinematography - location filming, unusual angles, and <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> {{as well as}} special, almost surrealist effects - distinguish the film from its surviving counterparts of race cinema." ...|$|R

2500|$|Jean-Pierre Melville {{opened his}} film [...] (1956) with a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> around the Montmartre quarter where {{the film is}} set, and voiceover then says [...] "" [...] ("It is at {{one and the same}} time heaven ... and ... hell").|$|E
2500|$|The long <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> {{through the}} Copacabana nightclub {{came about because}} of a {{practical}} problem: the filmmakers could not get permission {{to go in the}} short way, and this forced them to go round the back. Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry's entire life was ahead of him, commenting, [...] "It's his seduction of her [...] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him". This sequence was shot eight times.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "unchained camera technique" [...] ("Entfesselte Kamera" [...] in German) was an {{innovation}} by filmmaker F.W.

25|$|Because of the restrictively low budget, {{no light}} {{equipment}} was utilized during the shoot. Gregory Sandor shot the entire film in natural light.
