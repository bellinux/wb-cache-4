5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia are more susceptible to iron deficiency than <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person.</b> An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen {{experiences}} {{a very high}} turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) {{moved away from the}} town. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>person</b> lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, {{about a quarter of the}} population had lived in the town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state.|$|E
50|$|There were 9,505 {{household}}s. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>persons</b> {{living in}} a household was 2.31. The home ownership rate was 73.8%. The median value of owner-occupied units was $97,600. There were 12,484 housing units.|$|R

5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person</b> knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued {{that there is no}} shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person</b> would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person</b> wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E

5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person</b> in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person</b> in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E

50|$|Emotional mental {{illnesses}} {{should be a}} particular concern in the United States since the U.S. has the highest annual prevalence rates (26 percent) for {{mental illnesses}} among a comparison of 14 developing and developed countries. While approximately 80 percent of all people in the United States with a mental disorder eventually receive some form of treatment, on <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>persons</b> do not access care until nearly a decade following {{the development of their}} illness, and less than one-third of people who seek help receive minimally adequate care.|$|R

Despite many critical comparisons between GhostTunes and other online music stores, CEO Randy Bernard maintains the stance that GhostTunes is to serve as an alternative, not a direct competitor.|$|R

25|$|Two {{significant}} {{factors are}} evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net benefit that {{is higher than}} any column in Figure 165. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> married <b>person</b> (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid than does <b>the</b> <b>average</b> single <b>person</b> – {{no matter what the}} gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.|$|R

30|$|Those who {{embrace the}} virtues of {{goodness}} and trust can forgo ego and self-interest, but place their mind and heart on what people think and need. They always cultivate these two important virtues in their lives. Servant-leaders are completely different from <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>persons.</b> They treat everyone equally, whoever is good or bad, trustworthy or untrustworthy. They are the magnanimous persons with the greatness of soul. When faced with choices in lives, servant-leaders tend to pursue what is most noble, and what form them in excellence and benefit others most. They strive for greatness at the heart. This is the virtue by which servant-leaders pursue what is great and honorable in their lives, {{even if it is}} difficult.|$|R
