5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} {{fortunate}} position that on his accession to the earldom <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been no other serious contenders. In this respect his rule was unlike that of the earlier generation of the sons of Earl Thorfinn and {{of the next generation}} in that it avoided the bitter feuding that beset the earldom during both of those periods.|$|E
5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have been a number of}} small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} on executive functions {{suggests that the}} 'central' executive is not as central as conceived in the Baddeley & Hitch model. Rather, <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be separate executive functions that can vary largely independently between individuals and can be selectively impaired or spared by brain damage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} period, the system {{seems to be}} developing. The use of a dash and a curved {{horizontal}} line is found. A lotus (flower) mark seems to mark the end, and a circular mark appears to indicate the full stop. <b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be varieties of full stop.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} office in {{those that were}} palatine was that of seneschal. In those liberties that came under Crown control this office was held by a sheriff. The sovereign could and did appoint sheriffs in palatines; however, their power was confined to the church lands, and they became known as sheriffs of a County of the Cross, of which <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been as many in Ireland as there were county palatines.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} no signals on the Richborough Port branch beyond Poison Cross. The {{junctions}} and crossings with the harbour sidings at the port {{seems to have been}} completely unprotected, except that photographs of the putative passenger station there show that the crossing over the harbour line immediately to the east, on the west verge of the road, was provided with a gate which was presumably opened and closed by the train crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be no clear {{transitions}} {{makes it difficult}} to draw up a list of unique characteristics of H. heidelbergensis that distinguishes it from H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis. In general, the findings show a continuation of evolutionary trends that are emerging from around the Lower into Middle Pleistocene. Along with changes in the robustness of cranial and dental features, a remarkable increase in brain size from H. erectus towards H. heidelbergensis is noticeable.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, Heaviside {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} what is now known as the Kennellyâ€“Heaviside layer of the ionosphere. Heaviside's proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. The existence of the ionosphere was confirmed in 1923. The predictions by Heaviside, combined with Planck's radiation theory, probably discouraged further attempts to detect radio waves from the Sun and other astronomical objects. For whatever reason, <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been no attempts for 30 years, until Jansky's development of radio astronomy in 1932.|$|E

50|$|No {{conclusive}} {{theory has}} yet been formulated as to the origin of Sporadic E. Attempts to connect the incidence of Sporadic E with the eleven-year Sunspot cycle have provided tentative correlations. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be {{a positive correlation between}} sunspot maximum and Es activity in Europe. Conversely, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be a negative correlation between maximum sunspot activity and Es activity in Australasia.|$|R
25|$|But if we admit, goddesses, then, in {{addition}} to Nerthus, Ostara has the strongest claim to consideration. To what we said on p. 290 I can add some significant facts. The heathen Easter had {{much in common with}} May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have lingered among the people Easter-games so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate : I allude especially to the custom of Easter eggs, and to the Easter tale which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.|$|E
25|$|The Bwllfa Dare No. 1 Pit {{was opened}} in 1856 by E Lewis and worked by the Byllfa Colliery Co. Ltd., then Brogdens {{and then the}} Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Coal Collieries Ltd. <b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been two Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare companies. The first was founded in November 1876 to {{purchase}} the lease from Brogdens. George, the only Brogden son {{not to be a}} partner in John Brogden and Sons, was connected with this first Bwllfa-Merthyr company. It seems to have been reorganised in 1881. On 17 April 1890 a meeting was held at the pit head, attended by about 700 colliers, at which George was presented with an illuminated address and described as the proprietor.|$|E
25|$|The Cordillera of the Andes in Tierra del Fuego {{is formed}} of {{crystalline}} schists, and culminates in the snow-capped peaks of Mount Darwin and Monte Sarmiento in the Cordillera Darwin, which contains glaciers of {{greater extent than}} those of Mont Blanc. The extent of the glaciers is considerable in this region, which, geographically, {{is more complex than}} was formerly supposed. Although, in the explored portion of the Fuegian chain, the volcanoes which have been mentioned from time to time have not been met with, <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have existed to the south, on the islands, many neo-volcanic rocks, some of which appear to be contemporaneous with the basaltic sheet that covers a part of eastern Patagonia.|$|E

25|$|Jurchen {{script was}} based on the Khitan script, {{inspired}} in turn by Chinese characters. Apparently, both semantic and phonetic borrowing took place. Many Jurchen characters can be described as copies, or distorted copies of, Chinese and/or large-script Khitan characters with similar meaning; others apparently were derived from Chinese characters whose sound was similar to that of Jurchen words, without semantic connection. <b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be few Jurchen characters whose shapes can be related to the Khitan small-character script; however, the idea of using phonetic symbols for grammatical endings, for phonetics transcription of Chinese loanwords, or for writing words for which there were no special ideograms, may have been inspired by the Khitan small-character script.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state {{and asked me to}} go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} nanoflares might heat the corona was {{proposed}} by Eugene Parker in the 1980s {{but is still}} controversial. In particular, ultraviolet telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light, but <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be too few of these small events {{to account for the}} energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the TRACE data. Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The seven-year WMAP {{data were}} {{released}} on January 26, 2010. As {{part of this}} release, claims for inconsistencies with the standard model were investigated. Most were shown not to be statistically significant, and likely due to a posteriori selection (where one sees a weird deviation, but fails to consider properly how hard one has been looking; a deviation with 1:1000 likelihood will typically be found if one tries one thousand times). For the deviations that do remain, there are no alternative cosmological ideas (for instance, <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be correlations with the ecliptic pole). It seems most likely these are due to other effects, with the report mentioning uncertainties in the precise beam shape and other possible small remaining instrumental and analysis issues.|$|E
25|$|Neumarkt am Wallersee. Laid out as {{a planned}} town for Archbishop Eberhard II of Salzburg around 1240 and {{referred}} to as â€˜Novum Forumâ€™. It was a strategically important position on the NW boundary of Archdiocese and initially {{appears to have been}} commercially successful, but the Medieval layout {{does not appear to have}} survived, In 1638 the Salzburg Cathedral architect Santino Solari was commissioned to either fortify or re-fortify the site by the Archbishop Paris Graf von Lodron. The surviving evidence on the ground is slight. <b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be two or three pointed Italian trace bastions to the N of the Church and another to the S. It might be some form of Star fort, but quite possibly the fortifications were never completed.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} very few victims of the Black Death at higher levels of society. The {{only member of the}} royal family who can be said with any {{certainty}} to have died from the Black Death was in France {{at the time of her}} infection. Edward III's daughter Joan was residing in Bordeaux on her way to marry Pedro of Castile in the summer of 1348. When the plague broke out in her household she was moved to a small village nearby, but she could not avoid infection, and died there on 2 September. It is possible that the popular religious author Richard Rolle, who died on 30 September 1349, was another victim of the Black Death. The English philosopher William of Ockham has been mentioned as a plague victim. This, however, is an impossibility. Ockham was living in Munich at the time of his death, on 10 April 1347, two years before the Black Death reached that city.|$|E
