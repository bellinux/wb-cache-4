5|$|Due to <b>this</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> {{thought about}} the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. <b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the {{economic}} {{policies of the}} BJP was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat, where the BJP held power for 16 years. Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development. Its policies have included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services, {{as well as a}} significant rollback of labour and environmental regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP's upper class constituency instead of the poor.|$|E

5|$|When {{brought into}} service {{during the final}} years of World War II, the Iowa-class battleships were {{assigned}} to operate in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. By this point in the war, aircraft carriers had displaced battleships as the primary striking arm of both the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. As a result of <b>this</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> tactics, U.S. fast battleships of all classes were relegated to the secondary role of carrier escorts and assigned to the Fast Carrier Task Force to provide anti-aircraft screening for U.S. aircraft carriers and perform shore bombardment. Three were recalled to service in the 1950s with the outbreak of the Korean War, and provided naval artillery support for U.N. forces for the entire duration of the war before being returned to mothballs in 1955 after hostilities ceased. In 1968, to help alleviate U.S. air losses over North Vietnam, New Jersey was summoned to Vietnam, but was decommissioned a year after arriving. All four returned in the 1980s during the drive for a 600-ship Navy to counter the new Soviet s, only to be retired {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union on the grounds that they were too expensive to maintain.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} development came in 1834 when reformers in England who {{advocated for}} free trade succeeded in ending the monopoly of the British East India Company under the Charter Act {{of the previous}} year. <b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> trade policy opened the British China trade to private entrepreneurs, many of whom joined the highly profitable opium trade.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} reasons for <b>this</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> {{preferred}} subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican. The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.|$|E
25|$|Many newer {{or smaller}} {{companies}} only design and market their products; the actual production {{is done by}} Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite <b>this</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|Disruption in the {{previously}} supportive bonds of attachment {{and of the}} person's ability to manage their own affects challenges traditional, so called 'non-directive' client centered counseling approaches.

25|$|The first Olmec center, San Lorenzo, {{was all but}} {{abandoned}} around 900BCE {{at about}} the same time that La Venta rose to prominence. A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred circa 950BCE, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion.

25|$|By 1990, Astley had parted {{company with}} Stock Aitken Waterman. He {{also decided to}} leave his dance-pop days behind him, moving towards his passion, soul. <b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> musical genre led him to change his image too, {{ditching}} the boy next door look, presenting himself as a mature and passionate musician. His third album, Free, was released in 1991 containing collaborations with Elton John. The album contained three singles, and reached No 9 in the UK and No 31 in the US.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the hacker culture that Stallman thrived on began to fragment. To prevent {{software}} from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such proprietary software had existed before, {{and it became}} apparent that it would become the norm. <b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the legal characteristics of software can be regarded as a consequence triggered by the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976, as stated by Stallman's MIT colleague Brewster Kahle.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> {{dramatic}} <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> climate {{coincided with}} an apparent increase, rather than decrease, in {{the abundance of}} Tenontosaurus.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the {{intention}} was announced {{to extend the}} line back to Belgrave & Birstall. The former station had been vandalised and the Railway {{had no choice but}} to demolish the buildings. In 1990, a station called Leicester North was opened a hundred metres to the south of Belgrave & Birstall. <b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> location placed the new station inside Leicester's city boundary, allowing the 'Leicester' tag to be included in the name, along with unlocking extra funds to assist in the construction.|$|E
25|$|At its 2007 convention, the PPD {{approved}} a new philosophy and set of ideals for the party. The new philosophy commits {{the party to}} defending a political status for the island that is based in the irrevocable {{right of the people}} of Puerto Rico to form a sovereign country. <b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> philosophy caused a stir among party detractors, since the PPD was not known for being that liberal before. Its conservative stance had been represented by its unshakable defense of the commonwealth status quo.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{potential}} causes of <b>this</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the northern hemisphere circulation may {{have been associated with}} a shift in tropical weather patterns. In particular, this may have been caused by a strong Madden–Julian oscillation which occurred in the tropics in March. This is a large-scale tropical phenomenon which leads to disturbed weather patterns over a timescales of typically 30–60 days. These changes originate over the Indian Ocean and may have influenced the northern hemisphere weather regimes, as the Madden–Julian oscillation can be an important predictor {{of the state of the}} North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E

25|$|Less than a {{week before}} the 2006 elections, the Green Party shifted their stance on {{copyright}} reform. Additionally, both the Moderate Party and the Left Party changed their stances on internet downloads, and both prime ministerial candidates stated publicly that it shouldn't be illegal for young people to share files. Several influential analysts have credited the Pirate Party and its rising popularity for <b>this</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the political climate; these include a panel of senior editors at International Data Group and political analysts at the largest morning newspaper, Dagens Nyheter.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} {{genocide}} resulted in {{the election of a}} Tutsi government—the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). <b>This</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> power provided the minority Tutsi with access to power and privilege, completely shifting social conceptions. Attempts to re-build the war-torn country focused on eclipsing identity for fear that retaliation and punishment towards the Hutus would occur. The government’s agenda thus was to reduce identity to that of just being “Rwandan”. In this post-genocide society, identity was supposedly re-conceptualized to divert the emphasis from ethnicity to a division of the population into categories of victim, victors, survivors, and perpetrators.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view of the}} {{evolution}} of Resnais's career saw him moving progressively away from a realistic treatment of 'big' subjects and overtly political themes towards films that are increasingly personal and playful. Resnais himself offered an explanation of <b>this</b> <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> terms of challenging what was the norm in film-making at the time: having made his early films when escapist cinema was predominant, he progressively felt the need to move away from exploration of social and political issues as that itself became almost the norm in contemporary cinema. Experimentation with narrative forms and genre conventions instead became a central focus of his films.|$|E
