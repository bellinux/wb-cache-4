2500|$|Documents feature {{prominently}} in {{all manner of}} business and personal affairs. Almost any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> may become disputed in an investigation or litigation. For example, a questioned document may be {{a sheet of paper}} bearing handwriting or mechanically-produced text such as a ransom note, a forged cheque, or a business contract. It may be material not normally thought of as a 'document'. FDEs define the word [...] "document" [...] in a very broad sense as being any material bearing marks, signs, or symbols intended to convey a message or meaning to someone. This encompasses traditional paper documents but also includes things like graffiti on a wall, stamp impressions on meat products, or covert markings hidden in a written letter, among others.|$|E
2500|$|Asemic writing {{exists in}} many {{different}} forms. It is often created with a pen or brush, but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by photography, or to works on canvas, paper, computer images, and animations. The key to asemic writing {{is that even though}} it is traditionally [...] "unreadable" [...] it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's eye. Various asemic writing includes pictograms, or ideograms the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an abstract expressionist scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking. Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense. Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often calligraphic in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense, or can be understood through aesthetic intuition. True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. ciphers, wildstyle, etc). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes. Influences on asemic writing are illegible, invented, or primal scripts (cave paintings, doodles, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global postliterate style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are alien languages in science fiction, artistic languages, sigils (magick), undeciphered scripts, and graffiti. Uses for asemic writing include mental and creative idea stimulation, non-verbal communication, hoaxes, and general authorial self expression.|$|E

In this paper we propose a simple method for retrieving different documents within a single query representation, a single document representation and a single retrieval technique. We classify the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> and describe the properties of weighting schemes. Then, we explain that different properties of weighting schemes may retrieve different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents.</b> Experimental results show that significant improvements can be obtained by combining the retrieval results from different properties of weighting schemes...|$|R

The experiments were performed under four representative network connection technologies.

Furthermore, the effect of block size to the system performance was also studied. ...|$|R
