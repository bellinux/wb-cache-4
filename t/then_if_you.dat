2500|$|She {{has spoken}} {{out on a}} number of {{volatile}} political issues, including tort/litigation reform, but perhaps her most consistent theme—aside from gay and lesbian rights—has been her unstinting opposition to Communism, and unrelenting opposition to the former Eastern Bloc power structure that compelled her to flee her native Czechoslovakia. She has denounced the Soviet Union's control over Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she refuses to speak Russian to this day because of the Soviet Union's former hegemony over Eastern Europe."Whenever people go into politics and they try to say that Communism was a good thing, I say, 'Go ahead and live in a Communist country <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think it's so great.'

2500|$|In 1824, Solomos {{composed}} The Dialogue, {{dealing with}} the language issue. [...] The work involves three people: the poet, his friend (the first draft mentions Sp. Trikoupis) and the savant. [...] However, it is mainly the poet and the savant who speak. [...] The poet is {{trying to prove that}} katharevousa is an artificial language, of no use to either the people nor to literature. [...] The poet supports a literary language based on the language spoken by the people, that should be elaborated on by the poet. [...] In order to support his argument, the following phrase is used: [...] "firstly succumb to the language of the people and <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are worthy, conquer it". His arguments are based on the French Age of Enlightenment {{on the subject of the}} use of national languages and on examples of Italian poetry, by which he tries to prove that no word is vulgar in itself but gets its meaning by the poem's context. [...] At the end of the work, the poet abandons the rational reasoning and supports his arguments with passion.|$|E

2500|$|No direct {{orders to}} commit atrocities by Milošević {{have ever been}} discovered, though little or no effort was made by Milošević to punish people deemed {{responsible}} for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladić who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladić was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, you say you have so much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have such influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark... I warned Mladić not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|FIAC started {{holding its}} own BMX World Championships in 1984. At {{the time the}} IBMXF and FIAC were two {{separate}} International sanctioning bodies that both held BMX World Championships. However, the IBMXF's was far more prestigious, professionally competently run and established than FIAC. This was because FIAC refused help from either the IBMXF and the American for profit American Bicycle Association (then as now only one non-profit BMX sanctioning body per nation is recognized by the UCI as representing BMX in a nation. In the United States's case it was and is the NBL), both far more experienced {{at the time in}} running BMX races. In some nations if you race in the IBMXF circuit (see above) you could not race in the FIAC circuit and vice versa, akin to not being allowed to race NBL if you race the ABA circuit if they had such rules in America. FIAC had odd (to Americans) conventions and rules in conducting races, most likely grafted on from road racing in which was FIAC's only experience. For instance not only did you race three times to determine average positions in the motos to advance the best four riders to the next stage in racing, something Americans were familiar if they raced NBL, you also, if the class was big enough, raced the eighths, quarters and semis also three times and the best racers qualified for the Main. <b>Then</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did qualify for the Main, you had to race the Main five times to find the final ranking of racers. In the US only the Professionals in the 20" [...] class raced the Main multiple times and only three times at that in either the ABA or NBL. If anything this put a premium on consistency and lowered the luck factor to a bare minimum. However, it was very time consuming even at races scheduled over two days.|$|E
