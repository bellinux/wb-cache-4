25|$|Explicit phylogenetic methods {{rely upon}} the {{accuracy}} of the input rooted gene and species trees, yet these can be challenging to build. Even when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> the input trees, the conflicting phylogenies can be the result of evolutionary processes other than HGT, such as duplications and losses, causing these methods to erroneously infer HGT events when paralogy is the correct explanation. Similarly, in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, explicit phylogeny methods can erroneously infer HGT events. That is why some explicit model-based methods test multiple evolutionary scenarios involving different kinds of events, and compare their fit to the data given parsimonious or probabilistic criteria.|$|E
25|$|In the {{narrative}} Iranian history, Ardashir {{is described as}} a heroic, bold, forethoughtful man with a high amount of fortitude and mood. According to those texts, he was a persistent man and had a chivalric behavior though he applied much violence and cruelty, and fought alongside his warriors in battles. In {{the narrative}} Iranian history texts, Ardashir succeeded because he was from the line of the ancient Iranian shahanshahs and was chosen by the gods to rule Iran. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> that justifying the Sasanian rule occurred by adding some matters to the real trend of the events of the era later {{and at the end of}} their reign and it probably had a political reason to mention those matters in official writings.|$|E

500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice.

It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> my mind that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010. The band is also scheduled to support Lamb of God on their Australian tour in December 2009 Shadows Fall is pleased to announce their first and only New York City performance this year, taking place at Santos Party House on December 18, 2010 with direct support from Thy Will Be Done.|$|E
