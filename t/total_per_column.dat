However, over horizontal distances greater than about 100 km, the condition of isostatic equilibrium above the asthenosphere is a good approximation and the <b>total</b> mass <b>per</b> unit <b>column</b> is zero. Thus the surface distribution of mass is also zero. For this case we show that the surface gravitational potential anomaly can be uniquely related to a surface dipole distribution of mass. Variations in the thickness of the crust and lithosphere can be expected to produce undulations in the geoid...|$|R
