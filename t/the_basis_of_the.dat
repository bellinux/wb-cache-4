5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC.

In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Curia.
