40|$|Background Contrary to the proven {{benefits}} of iron, few concerns in producing the oxidative stress is remained problematic. Objectives The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the oxidative stress in the male Wistar rats fed bread supplemented with iron in different doses i. e., 35 (basic), 70 (two fold), 140 (four fold), and 210 mg/kg (six fold) with or without NaHCO 3 (250 mg/kg). Methods In this experimental study Iron, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), albumin, total protein, uric acid and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), were evaluated in 30 rats at the first and last day of the experiment (day 30). In addition, phytic acid levels were detected in all baked breads. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and t test procedure though SPSS statistical software version 20. Results Serum iron level in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> basic level of iron plus NaHCO 3 decreased significantly in the last day of the trial. Higher level of serum iron was seen in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron twofold, fourfold and sixfold and rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron fourfold plus NaHCO 3. Serum ceruloplasmin and ferritin in groups of rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> fourfold level of iron plus NaHCO 3 and rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron sixfold showed a significant increase (P ≤ 0. 05). Serum total protein and uric acid in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> basic level of iron plus NaHCO 3 and rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> twofold level of iron showed a significant decrease. Serum total protein levels in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> fourfold level of iron showed a significant decrease. Bread with NaHCO 3 showed higher phytic acid levels than other groups. Conclusions These results indicate that oxidative stress was not induced, whereas some antioxidant activities were significantly changed in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron-enriched bread...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} studies revealed that, in a murine model of asthma, mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Fas-deficient T cells developed a prolonged phase of airway inflammation, mucus production, and airway hyperreactivity {{that failed to}} resolve even 6 weeks after the last challenge. To investigate how Fas–Fas ligand (FasL) interaction occurs between T cells and other cells in vivo, Gld mice with abnormalities of the FasL signaling pathway were used. The reconstituted mice were made by transferring T cells from B 6 or Gld mice to Rag−/− or FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice. We found that Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> B 6 T cells resolved the airway inflammation, whereas FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells developed a prolonged airway inflammation at Day 28, with decreased IFN-γ production. Both FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> B 6 T cells and Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells also had completely resolved their airway inflammation by Day 28 after challenge. Interestingly, FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells eventually resolved airway inflammation at Day 42, with a similar level of IFN-γ production to that of control group. These results demonstrate that FasL expression on either T cells only or non–T cells only was sufficient for the eventual resolution of airway inflammation, and the prolonged airway inflammation in FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells was correlated with decreased IFN-γ production by Gld T cells...|$|R
5|$|One {{point of}} {{criticism}} {{is that the}} film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces.

Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.|$|E

40|$|When {{there is}} {{significant}} doubt about a firm's ability to continue as a going concern, professional standards require independent auditors to disclose the uncertainty in their report. This study assesses {{the influence of the}} independent auditor's going-concern evaluation by examining default following the release of the auditor's report. We use a proprietary sample maintained by the Portuguese Central Bank on 12, 199 audit reports relating to approximately 2000 firms that are liable by law to have their accounts audited on an annual basis. Empirical estimation of a logit model controlling for accounting cash- flow-related and nonaccounting variables shows that the likelihood of default for firms <b>that</b> <b>received</b> going concern opinion is 2. 792 times that of firms <b>that</b> <b>received</b> a clean opinion. Likelihood ratio tests for omitted variable also confirm the incremental predictive ability of going-concern opinion over and above accounting and nonaccounting variables for the estimation and hold-out samples. In the nondefaulting group, the average default rate is 6. 05 %, in the defaulting group it is 17. 78 %. The default rate for firms in the nondefaulting group <b>that</b> <b>received</b> a going-concern opinion is 9. 92 % and for firms <b>that</b> <b>received</b> a clean opinion it is 5. 96 %. In the defaulting group, the rate for firms <b>that</b> <b>received</b> a going-concern opinion is 35. 49 % and for firms <b>that</b> <b>received</b> a clean opinion it is 16. 96 %.

Six healthy Boer - Indigenous African crossbreed goats were by randomised cross-over designated to 6 groups: Group SAL <b>that</b> <b>received</b> saline, Group ACE <b>that</b> <b>received</b> acepromazine, Group MID <b>that</b> <b>received</b> midazolam, Group BUT <b>that</b> <b>received</b> butorphanol, Group ACEBUT <b>that</b> <b>received</b> acepromazine and butorphanol and Group MIDBUT <b>that</b> <b>received</b> midazolam and butorphanol as premedication agents intramuscularly on different occasions at least 3 weeks apart. The degree of sedation was assessed 20 minutes after {{administration of the}} premedication agents. Thirty minutes after premedication, the dose of propofol required for induction of anaesthesia adequate to allow placement of an endotracheal tube was determined. Cardiovascular, respiratory and arterial blood-gas parameters were assessed up to 30 minutes after induction of general anaesthesia. Acepromazine and midazolam produced significant sedation when administered alone, but premedication regimens incorporating butorphanol produced inconsistent results. The dose of propofol required for induction of anaesthesia was significantly reduced in goats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> midazolam alone, or midazolam combined with either acepromazine or butorphanol. The quality of induction of anaesthesia was good in all groups, including the control group. Cardiovascular, respiratory and blood-gas parameters were within normal limits in all groups and not significantly different between or within all groups. In conclusion: sedation with midazolam alone, or midazolam combined with either acepromazine or butorphanol significantly reduces the induction dose of propofol with minimal cardiopulmonary effects in goats...|$|R
