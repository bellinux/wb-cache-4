After a {{long period}} of stagnation, the Underground began to be expanded again with Lines B and E within the scope of these plans, though only the extension of Line E was commenced and completed before <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> where expansion was once again stalled. During this time, four Premetro feeder lines were planned leading out from the western termini of Lines D and E as well as one in Puerto Madero, however only Line E2 was completed in 1987 and these plans were scrapped in 1994 when operation of the Underground changed hands.|$|E

25|$|Participants in the February {{coup attempt}} were tried under the regular {{military}} justice system. But {{in response to}} the November coup attempt, the government created ad hoc courts based on the 1938 legal code of Eleazar López Contreras, drawn up twenty years before <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy.</b> The Supreme Court ultimately ruled the courts unconstitutional but not on the due process grounds for which they were criticised. The Court instead found that the President had neglected to suspend the relevant constitutional rights (right to a defense, right to be tried by one's natural judge).|$|E
25|$|With {{the start}} of <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> in 1990, the city of Santiago had surpassed the three million inhabitants, with the {{majority}} living in the south: La Florida was the most populous area, followed by Puente Alto and Maipú. The real estate development in these municipalities and others like Quilicura and Peñalolen largely came from the construction of housing projects for middle-class families. Meanwhile, high-income families moved into the foothills, now called Barrio Alto, increasing the population of Las Condes and giving rise to new communes like Vitacura and Lo Barnechea. Moreover, although poverty began to drop significantly, there remained a strong dichotomy between the thriving global city and scattered city slums.|$|E

25|$|The resounding {{victory of}} Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy in 2015 general {{elections}} has raised {{hope for a}} successful transition of Myanmar from a closely held military rule to a free democratic system.

The recent murder of Ko Ni, a prominent Muslim lawyer and a key member of Myanmar’s governing National League for Democracy party {{is seen as a}} serious blow to the country’s fragile democracy.

His political activity helped <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> in Brazil {{in the aftermath of the}} military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015.

25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy,</b> the Attorney-General {{suspended}} {{the operation of}} the three Regional Traditional courts and the National Traditional Appeal Court in October 1993. Their indefinite suspension amounted in practice to their abolition. When the new Constitution came into force on 18 May 1994, it established a court structure in which magistrates' courts would hear cases involving customary law, with appeals lying to the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal, and it transferred all cases pending before the Traditional courts and its appeals court to Magistrates' courts or the High Court. The chairmen of many of the lower-level Traditional courts were appointed as magistrates and their courts became Magistrates' Courts. Many of those lower level Traditional courts that were not converted into Magistrates' courts continued to operate informally. The 1994 Constitution recognised customary law {{as an integral part of}} the legal system and provided for courts using customary law with limited jurisdiction over civil and minor criminal cases, but no legislation to set up such courts was introduced before 2011, possibly because there was a limited demand for formal traditional courts, as most communities had informal traditional mechanisms for the settlement of disputes.|$|E
