The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services.

5|$|As senator, Ford has {{introduced}} many bills {{with only a}} small number becoming law, but has been more successful in contributing to compromise bills. After becoming senator, Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House. It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag, and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s as a symbol of discrimination. Following years of debate, the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford. He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Confederate Memorial Day as paid holidays. Ford stated that he hoped <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>would</b> improve race relations in South Carolina.|$|E

Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native Hawaiian sovereignty activists, (who feel <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>would</b> thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).|$|E

25|$|The Roșia Montană Project, {{a mining}} project aimed {{to bring to}} the surface 350 tonnes of gold and 1,500 tonnes of silver, met a {{significant}} resistance from environmental groups in Romania and neighbouring countries. Among the dissatisfactions of environmentalists are the pollution by cyanidation and the extremely low percentage of which Romania will benefit from this exploitation. A concern was the fact that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>would</b> give the Roșia Montană Gold Corporation the right to give compulsory purchase orders to the residents of Roșia Montană who refused to sell their houses and lands.

Romney argued that the bill would cost the state government $15million and that Massachusetts should not reward illegal immigration. A study by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation predicted that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>would</b> generate over $5million in state revenues; the Massachusetts Coalition for Immigration Reform disputed this conclusion.

25|$|A's success {{caused a}} {{backlash}} {{that threatened to}} destroy it. Thousands of mom-and-pop grocery stores could not match A's prices. While small operators had little political clout, they were supplied by thousands of wholesale distributors which had considerable political influence. Anti-chain store movements gained traction in the 1920s, but became significantly stronger during the Depression. In 1935, Texas Congressman Wright Patman introduced legislation that would have levied a federal tax on chain stores. If adopted, this legislation likely would have ended A While this legislation did not move in Congress, in 1936 Patman sponsored the Robinson–Patman Act that outlawed charging different prices to similar customers; this law passed. Patman then reintroduced his first bill. A retained a lobbyist and dropped its opposition to unionizing activities of the politically powerful American Federation of Labor. George and John Hartford also took {{the unusual step of}} publishing an open letter pointing out that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>would</b> significantly increase food prices. The tide of public opinion then turned against the bill, which was defeated.|$|E
25|$|The project again caused {{significant}} controversy, but {{was eventually}} terminated. In early October 1997, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry proposed legislation giving National Children's Island, Inc., a 99-year lease on Kingman and Heritage islands. Although it initially appeared that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>would</b> pass quickly, {{opposition from the}} Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund led several Council members to withdraw {{their support for the}} lease. Opponents pointed out, too, that the company had performed none of the studies required by the 1993 Council vote. The delay doomed the project. In 1995, Congress had imposed a Financial Control Board on the D.C. government in an attempt to help the city avoid impending bankruptcy. The Control Board had the power to override decisions made by the mayor and city council. On March 5, 1999, the Financial Control Board exercised that power and voided the city's agreements to build Children's Island. The Control Board said the project would cost too much and was not financially viable. The decision {{was the first time the}} panel overturned a decision by city officials.|$|E
