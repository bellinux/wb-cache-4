50|$|These {{treatments}} aim {{to straighten}} curls and waves {{and to reduce}} frizz. The treatments do guarantee completely straight hair if done correctly, with 85 to 100 percent of the curl gone depending on the original hair texture. Treatments last around 10-12 weeks and repeating the treatment every few months will allow for treatment of new growth. Depending on the treatment used, downtime after it is performed ranges from no-wait to a 72-hour {{period in which the}} recipient cannot wash or wet the hair, exercise, tuck the hair behind the ears, or pin it up with any hair clip, pony <b>tail</b> <b>holder</b> or headband, as doing so may compromise the result of the treatment.|$|E

Tail vein injections are a routine but critical step in most imaging applications, with poor injections greatly affectingthe experimental results. The high skills and experience required to perform successful tail vein injections leave many preclinical imaging scientists ill-suited to perform this task. In a recent study, we found that trained routine injectors left on average 14 % of the injected probe in the tail tissue. Improvements in injection accuracy, injection consistency, safety, and a reduction in time required to perform the task are needed in preclinical molecular imaging. To achieve these goals, we have devised a semi-automated vascular access system (VAS) to facilitate injections and eventually blood sampling from the mouse tail. We have eliminated much of the human error involved in the manual approach by using a computer-controlled mechanically moving micro-needle. To make use of the VAS, one places an anesthetized mouse onto the temperature controlled mouse bed and secures the tail on a heated <b>tail</b> <b>holder.</b> The VAS uses NIR light, cross-polarizers, and a basic CCD camera to image the tail. The reflection image is processed and the vein is located using edge detection methods. The vein location is plotted and over-laid onto the live video feed of the mouse tail. Using a custom designed user interface, the user properly aligns the needle to the tail vein by employing computer-controlled motors. Once the needle is properly aligned, it begins to penetrate the tail tissue and enter the vein. A pressure transducer attached to the needle detects when the needle has entered the vein, and automatically stops further progression of the needle. With the needle inside the vein, probes can be injected manually, with a liquid handling system, or via a syringe pump. The VAS was first validated using a mouse tail phantom. The phantom was a PDMS chip with channels equivalent to the dimensions of a mouse tail vein (300 um). The channels were filled with water and pressurized to variable pressures. With the phantom, the ability for the VAS to align a needle according to an image, insert a needle into a desired location, and stop the progression of the needle based on a pressure signal were tested and verified. Mouse studies were also performed with the VAS. These studies showed that the accuracy of the device, as measured by the percentage of injected probe left in the tail, is 3. 4 % (+/- 4. 5). The VAS reduces the operator skill requirements and training, has the potential to improve injection accuracy, reduces the time required to perform a tail vein injection, and is potentially safer for users and mice in comparison to current manual methods...|$|E

We prove that the homogenized boundary data belong to W^ 1, p for any 1 <p<∞. In particular, this implies that the boundary layer <b>tails</b> are <b>Hölder</b> continuous of order α for any α∈ (0, 1). Comment: 26 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} limit theorems for component–wise maxima {{of independent}} and identically distributed heavy–tailed processes. The focus here is on weak convergence in Hölder spaces. Given that the finite–dimensional distributions converge, the classical tightness conditions of Lamperti apply, provided {{that one can}} control the tail–behavior of Hölder norms. Here, by using a powerful isomorphism theorem due to Ciesielski, we provide estimates for the <b>tails</b> of <b>Hölder</b> norms for light, moderate and heavy–tailed processes. As a consequence, we establish sufficient conditions for the Hölder regularity of several classes of doubly stochastic max–stable processes such as Schlather and Brown–Resnick processes. Some of our results extend {{to the case of}} weak convergence in Besov spaces. ...|$|R
50|$|The fee tail {{has been}} {{abolished}} {{in all but}} four states in the United States: Massachusetts, Maine, Delaware and Rhode Island. However, {{in the first three}} states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life estate with remainder in the life tenant's children. New York abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a fee simple; even in those four states that still allow fee <b>tail,</b> the estate <b>holder</b> may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.|$|R

Using {{a variant of the}} Euler–Maruyama scheme for stochastic functional differential equations with bounded memory driven by Brownian motion we show that only weak one-sided local Lipschitz (or “monotonicity”) conditions are sufficient for local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions. In case of explosion the method yields the maximal solution up to the explosion time. We also provide a weak growth condition which prevents explosions to occur. In an appendix we formulate and prove four lemmas which may be of independent interest: three of them can be viewed as rather general stochastic versions of Gronwall's Lemma, the final one provides <b>tail</b> bounds for <b>Hölder</b> norms of stochastic integrals.

The foursome <b>tails</b> the card <b>holder</b> in a casino to copy his card. Meanwhile, Sara becomes shaken when she learns from Lincoln that Michael may have a brain aneurysm and could die soon like his mother did. Roland's device fails to pick up any signal, and Lincoln deduces that the card holder is keeping his card in his room. At an outdoor swimming pool, Sara is wearing a string bikini with a transparent dress over it and is sent to hit up the card holder by faking {{that she was on}} a stagette party and her friends dared her to get a photo in a whale room. However, the card holder refuses and leaves. The bartender tells her that she [...] "isn't his type" [...] and that the card holder asked if he [...] "liked to party." [...] This leads to the team using Sucre instead, who accepts very reluctantly.|$|R
