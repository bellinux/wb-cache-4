50|$|Rather than {{experiencing}} the entire {{game in a}} single play-through, Dragon Quarter is designed to encourage the player to play through the title multiple times in order to experience the whole story. Using the Scenario Overlay (SOL) System, certain plot points and areas of the game are only accessible if the player's D-Ratio number is high enough. When players begin the game, their D-Ratio is represented as the fraction 1/8192, and can only be raised by continually restarting the game and using the SOL: Restore function, which allows them to begin a brand-new game while carrying over all accumulated items, equipment, and skills found up until that point. Progress is saved to the PlayStation 2's memory card using limited Save Tokens found during gameplay. Players may also suspend their game {{as many times as}} they wish by creating a <b>temporary</b> <b>save</b> at certain areas in the game, which are deleted as soon as they are loaded.|$|E

5000|$|Programming {{languages}} {{should allow}} a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This {{is referred to}} as [...] "preferredWidth" [...] in the standard, and {{it should be possible to}} set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any <b>temporaries</b> <b>saved,</b> using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus for instance a compiler targeting x87 floating point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use doubled extended format. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.|$|R

30|$|Firstly, {{some authors}} {{emphasize}} that the length of stay may affect the level of remittances, but not savings. Merkle and Zimmermann (1992) found that the planned duration of the stay in the host country is a significant determinant of remittances, but they {{show that there is}} no significant effect for savings. Dustmann and Mestres (2010) investigates the saving plans and the assets holdings of migrants and shows that immigrants with temporary return plans place a higher proportion of their savings in the home country as remittances, with little effect on the national savings of the host economy. The magnitude and the share of assets accumulated at home (including the housing value) are larger for the immigrants who consider migration as temporary. Notwithstanding this effect on remittances, he finds no evidence that the <b>temporary</b> migrants <b>save</b> more than the permanent ones.|$|R

40|$|Redundancy {{elimination}} optimizations avoid repeated computation of {{the same}} value by computing the value once, saving it in a temporary, and reusing the value from the temporary when it is needed again. Examples of redundancy elimination optimizations include common subexpression elimination, loop invariant code motion and partial redundancy elimination. We demonstrate that the introduction of <b>temporaries</b> to <b>save</b> computed values {{can result in a}} significant increase in register pressure. An increase in register pressure may in turn trigger generation of spill code which can more than offset the gains derived from redundancy elimination. While current techniques minimize increases in register pressure, to avoid spill code generation it is instead necessary to ensure that register pressure does not exceed the number of available registers. In this paper we develop a redundancy elimination algorithm that is sensitive to register pressure: our novel technique first sets upper limits on al [...] ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increased}} use of networks of NT workstations for long-running engineering applications, process checkpointing and process migration can avoid wasted computer cycles and improve system utilization. The problem we solve is how to capture and reconstruct process state transparently and efficiently without affecting the correctness of the application. A checkpoint facility enables the intermediate state of a process to be saved to a file. Users can later resume execution of the process from the checkpoint file. This prevents the loss of data generated by long-running processes due to program or system failures, and it also facilitates debugging when the bug appears after the program has executed for a long time. This paper describes the implementation of a checkpoint library that permits users to <b>save</b> <b>temporary</b> state of long-running multi-threaded programs on a Windows/NT system and to resume execution from the checkpointed state at a later time. Our Windows implementation is th [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{savings and}} asset holdings of immigrants {{in relation to}} their return plans. We argue that savings and asset accumulation may be affected by return plans of immigrants. Further, the way savings and assets are held in the home- and host country may also be related to future return plans. Thus, comparing savings and assets between immigrants and natives may lead to serious underestimation when neglecting the home country component. We show that immigrants with temporary return plans place a higher proportion of their savings in the home country. In addition, both the magnitude and the share of assets and housing value accumulated in the home country are larger for immigrants who consider their migration as temporary, and lower the value of assets and property held in the host country. Finally, and conditional on observable characteristics, we find no evidence that immigrants with <b>temporary</b> migration plans <b>save</b> more than immigrants with permanent migration plans. international migration, wealth accumulation, housing demand...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} limited fossil fuels {{combined}} with the vast technological improvements {{in recent years has}} initiated numerous installations of renewable power production, particularly in form of photovoltaic cells and wind turbines. Since the volatile character of wind and solar radiation leads to a fluctuating power production, these renewables are incapable of providing reliable base load power. To enable the transition to a renewable energy system, large-scale energy storage is required to compensate for short-term and seasonal imbalances and to <b>save</b> <b>temporary</b> excess power. Due to the order of magnitude involved, this can best be achieved by converting electricity into hydrogen via electrolysis, a process that is also called “power to gas”. Hereby, hydrogen can serve as a link combining the electricity, traffic and heating sector into one energy market. This paper presents the process chains of different power-to-gas paths, including different transformation technologies, which it evaluates with regard to their suitability for applications, the optional methanation step including the necessary production of CO 2, distribution options and geological storage options as well as end-user applications. Finally, the use of hydrogen and methane in transportation and reconversion to power are compared from the economic point of view...|$|R
50|$|In December 1547 {{employed}} in conveying treasure to his father, Sir Edward Wotton, at Calais, and in 1551 succeeded to his estates, his father having procured two acts of parliament ‘disgavelling’ his lands in Kent. Edward VI had intended making him K.B., but after Mary's accession {{the council on}} 19 Sept. 1553 wrote him a letter ‘discharging him from being knight of the Bath, whereunto he was once appointed and written unto’ (Acts P. C. 1552-4, p. 351). On 16 Jan. 1553-4 he was summoned before the council, and on 21 Jan. ‘for obstinate standing against matters of religion was committed to the Fleet, to remain there a close prisoner’ (ib. pp. 385, 389). Walton in his ‘Life of Sir Henry Wotton’ (Reliquiæ Wottonianæ, 1685, sig. b4) declares that the council's action was due to Nicholas Wotton, who had twice dreamt that his nephew {{was in danger of}} participating in some dangerous enterprise, apparently Wyatt's rebellion, and secured his <b>temporary</b> imprisonment to <b>save</b> him from worse perils. The date of his release has not been ascertained; but on 23 Nov. 1558, six days after Elizabeth's accession, he was made sheriff of Kent. For nearly thirty years he was regularly included in the various commissions for the county, such as those for the peace, for taking musters, gaol delivery, examining into cases of piracy, and fortifying Dover. In July 1573 he entertained Queen Elizabeth at Boughton Malherbe, when he declined an offer of knighthood, and in 1578-9 again served as sheriff. He was a person of ‘great learning, religion, and wealth,’ and a patron of learning and Protestantism in others. Thomas Becon dedicated to him his ‘Book of Matrimony,’ and Edward Dering his ‘Sparing Restraint.’ William Lambarde also dedicated to Wotton in 1570 his ‘Perambulation of Kent,’ which was published in 1576 with a prefatory letter by Wotton.|$|R
5000|$|More {{than half}} a century in the future the forefathers of the Earth {{government}} designed the [...] "Stasis Initiative". It was to be a <b>temporary</b> measure to <b>save</b> humankind from dwindling resources by cutting the consumption of said resources in half by dividing the population and rotating the two shifts in and out of suspended animation every 72 hours with a group of [...] "Elite" [...] managers as overseers of the process. Though not ideal, the system works. However civil unrest is becoming rampant. [...] "Stasis Jumpers", workers that refuse to report to their stasis shifts are becoming a problem. A dissatisfaction with the government and the Stasis Initiative is running high and the new initiative to relocate the Alpha workers to a countryside perimeter has provided ample fodder for a growing underground resistance movement that could tear their way of life apart. Behind the daily routine of the Stasis shifts, two workers, Eric and Larissa, have fallen in love. Simple enough but for the fact that Eric is a Beta and Larissa is an Alpha. Their destiny is separated by stretches of time {{in and out of a}} stasis pod with the moment that they switch places as the only time they physically ever see each other. As they work their respective shifts, they communicate their love to each other with holographic messages, computer games, and secret messages. Dominic, a former shift worker now an Elite manager, is allowed to forgo the stasis that has constrained many in his society. He is eager to see that the workers have a better future but at the same time he believes in the Stasis Initiative. Even more, it seems he now has an attraction to Larissa. The rule of the Elites is also becoming strained under the stress of ending the Stasis Initiative and the Resistance rebellion. Elites that challenge the rule of authority they currently hold find themselves in contempt and jailed and the underclass of the Alphas and Betas seems destined to serve only as a slave class, to the elite managers, in and out of stasis. With the new initiative to [...] "relocate" [...] the Alpha workers looming on the horizon, Eric makes a startling discovery that could spell disaster not only for his beloved Larissa, but for millions of Alphas. Eric will find his love for one becoming a fight for many.|$|R
