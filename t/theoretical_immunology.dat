40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} {{and analyze the}} stochastic dynamics obeyed by a model of an immune network recently introduced by the authors. We develop Fokker-Planck equations for the single lymphocyte behavior and coarse grained Langevin schemes for the averaged clone behavior. After showing agreement with real systems (as a short path Jerne cascade), we suggest, both with analytical and numerical arguments, explanations for the generation of (metastable) memory cells, improvement of the secondary response (both in the quality and quantity) and bell shaped modulation against infections as a natural behavior. The whole emerges from the model without being postulated a-priori as it often occurs in second generation immune networks: so {{the aim of the}} work is to present some out-of-equilibrium features of this model and to highlight mechanisms which can replace a-priori assumptions in view of further detailed analysis in <b>theoretical</b> systemic <b>immunology.</b> (c) 2010 Elsevier B.

He has contributed {{at the highest}} level to particle physics, computer science, fluid mechanics, <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology,</b> etc. etc. Today we honor him for his outstanding contributions to statistical physics, and particularly to the theories of phase transitions and of disordered systems. Among these many contributions, I would specifically mention Parisi's early work in which he showed how conformal invariance {{can be used in a}} quantitative way to calculate critical exponents. He was also the first to really understand that one can derive critical exponents through expansions of the beta function at fixed dimensions, avoiding the convergence problems of the epsilon-expansion. The opened the way to the current best theoretical estimates of exponents. Another important achievement concerns the mapping of the branched polymer problem in d dimensions onto that of the Lee-Yang edge singularity on d &minus; 2 dimensions. Most recently, Parisi's work on interfaces in disordered media and on the dynamics of growing interfaces has had a large impact on these fields. However, Parisi's deepest contribution concerns the solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean field model for spin glasses. After the crisis caused by the unacceptable properties of the simple solutions, which used the [...] "replication trick", Parisi proposed his replica symmetry breaking solution, which seems to be exact, although much more complex than anticipated. Later, Parisi and co-workers Mezard and Virasoro clarified greatly the physical meaning of the mysterious mathematics involved in this scheme, in terms of the probability distribution of overlaps and the ultrametric structure of the configuration space. This achievement forms one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of disordered systems. This discovery opened the doors to vast areas of application. e.g., in optimization problems and in neural network theories.The Boltzmann Medal for 1992 is hereby awarded to Giorgio Parisi for his fundamental contributions to statistical physics, and particularly for his solution of the mean field theory of spin glasses." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{idiotypic network}} {{has a long}} and {{chequered}} history in both <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> and Artificial Immune Systems. In terms of the latter, the drive for engineering applications {{has led to a}} diluted interpretation of the immunological models. Research inspired by <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> has produced compelling models of self-organised tolerance and immunity, but currently fail to have any practical engineering applicability. In this paper, we briefly discuss the engineering applicability of “self-affirming ” idiotypic networks, leading to a suggestion that the “Third Generation ” network models represent a way forward in this respect. Results obtained by implementing and extending a discrete model of this type of network suggest that the extended prototype is capable of two context-dependent modes of immune response, readily applicable to unsupervised machine-learning. ...|$|E

40|$|Autoimmune {{reactions}} are in most circumstances considered to represent damaging or at best neutral phenomena for the individual. In {{the present article}} {{we would like to}} describe an autoimmune system, which we consider to carry great promise with regard to both <b>theoretical</b> and clinical <b>immunology.</b> No evidence exists that genes, that code for the antigen-binding sites of immunoglobulin molecules, have been under any phylogenetic selective pressure as to avoid the creation of sites with reactivity for self-components. Failure of an individual to express immune reactivity against self can thus frequently be ascribed to a phenomenon occurring during ontogeny, that is specific immune paralysis. Several levels of tolerance would seem to exist that to a varying degree involve different subsets of lymphocytes. One decisive factor in determining whether immune paralysis will occur or not is the concentration of the respective self-component in the body fluids. Here, it can be shown that the antigen-binding sites of the autochthonous immunoglobulin molecules under appropriate conditions can function as immunogens resulting in the productio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Antigen epitopes provide {{valuable}} information useful for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Recently, {{more and more}} databases focusing on different types of epitopes have become available. Conformational epitopes are an important form of epitope formed by residues that are sequentially discontinuous but close together in three-dimensional space. These epitopes have implicit structural information, making them attractive for both theoretical and applied biomedical research. However, most existing databases focus on linear rather than conformational epitopes. Description We describe CED, a special database of well defined conformational epitopes. CED provides a collection of conformational epitopes and related information including the residue make up and location of the epitope, the immunological property of the epitope, the source antigen and corresponding antibody of the epitope. All entries in this database are manually curated from articles published in peer review journals. The database can be browsed or searched through a user-friendly web interface. Most epitopes in CED can also be viewed interactively {{in the context of}} their 3 D structures. In addition, the entries are also hyperlinked to various databases such as Swiss-Prot, PDB, KEGG and PubMed, providing wide background information. Conclusion A conformational epitope database called CED has been developed as an information resource for investigators involved in both <b>theoretical</b> and applied <b>immunology</b> research. It complements other existing specialised epitope databases. The database is freely available at [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Herpes viruses {{have evolved}} over time {{developing}} a complex strategy for maintaining persistent infection in humans. This sophisticated group of viruses usually persists asymptomatically {{for the life}} of the host, controlled by constant immune surveillance. These viruses stimulate a large number of T cells which suppress the virus and protect the host from herpes-related pathologies. However, if the immune system is weakened, the virus may become lytic, proliferate and initiate pathogenesis. The outcome of infection with these viruses is highly variable, and an unfortunate minority suffer major life threatening clinical problems. For this reason, it is important to understand the complicated machinations involved in T cell immunology and how it works to actively control virus. Viral peptide epitopes are present on the surface of virus-infected cells and are recognised by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) of the immune system only when bound to cell surface molecules called human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in humans. These HLA molecules are highly polymorphic, with each different HLA capable of binding a distinct set of viral peptides. Over the last 2 decades, various studies have identified the viral peptides that are recognised in the CTL response to herpes viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The critical molecule on the surface of CTLs that is involved in specific recognition of viral peptides is the T cell receptor (TCR). To accommodate the huge variety of viral peptides presented by infected cells, millions of different TCR molecules are expressed by CTLs to ensure an appropriate TCR is available for binding to most viral peptides. Interestingly, some viral peptides are recognised by a large variety of TCR molecules while others are targeted by very few. This restriction in TCR usage is sometimes so extreme that the same “public TCRs” emerge in different individuals through mechanisms that are unclear. Polymorphism within the various levels of these immune responses may alter or compromise immunogenic competence. Highly polymorphic HLA molecules and viral genome sequence variability, in addition to TCR gene polymorphism could represent an important mechanism for inter-individual differences in antiviral T cell responses and disease progression. A more complete understanding of the influence these factors have on the immune system and disease pathogenesis will likely enhance both <b>theoretical</b> and clinical <b>immunology...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} of complex biological systems {{has been shown}} to lead to contradictory results. Two completely different approaches are compared using a highly dynamic system of the adaptive immune response with medical relevance. In germinal centers, high affinity antibodies are newly generated from antigen-activated B cell clones. The encoded antibody is mutated and high affinity clones for a specific antigen are selected to survive, giving rise to affinity maturation of antibodies. Here, the general assumption that competition for antigen held on follicular dendritic cells is responsible for affinity maturation is shown to be unlikely. This finding is based on the investigation of eight different selection mechanisms. A realistic model on selection mechanisms leading to affinity maturation is developed. It is found that negative selection of B cell, a B cell refractory time for binding antigen, and competition for T cell help, have strongest impact on affinity maturation. Antigen consumption is demonstrated to have impact on the kinetics of the germinal center in the late phase of the reaction and is hypothesized to be responsible for the termination of the reaction. These results are consistently found with agent-based and ordinary differential equation approaches and can, thus be considered to be robust.
