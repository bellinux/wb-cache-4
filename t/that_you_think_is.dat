5000|$|Past {{research}} has tested {{the reliability and}} validity of the figure rating scale. In order to test the strength and reliability of this measurement, researchers assigned six specific instructions to ask of their participants during figure selection. The instructions are as follows: (1) choose your ideal figure; (2) choose the figure that reflects how you think you look; (3) choose the figure that reflects how you feel most of the time; (4) choose the figure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> most preferred by men; (5) choose the figure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> most preferred by women; and (6) pick the opposite sex figure that you find most attractive. For validity analyses, the figure ratings can be transformed into the three following discrepancy measures: (1) feel minus ideal; (2) think minus ideal; and (3) feel minus think. The instructions developed for these measures may be interchanged depending on the specific topic of research or category of observation. Each research study may provide a different set of reliability and validity assessments for the figure rating scale dependent upon the goal and procedures of the study.|$|E

40|$|The prior {{literature}} on strategic reasoning by humans of the sort, {{what do you}} think that I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> that humans generally do not reason beyond a single level. They thinkabout others ’ strategies butnot about others ’ reasoning about their strategies. When repeatedly faced with another who reasons about their strategies, humans learn to think one level deeper but the learning is generally slow and incomplete. However, recent evidence suggests that if the games are made competitive and therefore representationally simpler, humans generally exhibited behavior that was more consistent with deeper levels of recursive reasoning. We seek to computationally model the judgment and behavioral data thatis consistent with deep recursive reasoning in competitive games. We present process models built from agent frameworks that not only simulate the observed data well but also exhibit psychological intuition. Our goal is to gain insights into the strategic thinking process, ultimately leading to agents which can emulate human decision making and effectively interact with humans in mixed settings...|$|E

40|$|When you are {{a critic}} of the {{received}} wisdom in economics, as I am, at some point you have to stop and consider whether there is anything in the conventional approach to the subject <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> actually right.

40|$|ABSTRACT Content-based music {{retrieval}} {{research has}} mostly focused on symbolic data rather than acoustical data. Given {{that there are}} no general-purpose transcription algorithms that can convert acoustical data into musical scores, new methods are needed to do music retrieval on acoustical data. In this paper, we review some existing methods on contentbased music retrieval, discuss different definitions of music similarity, and present a new framework to perform music indexing and retrieval. The framework is based on an earlier prototype we developed, with significant improvements. In our framework known as MACSIS, each audio file is broken down into small segments and converted into feature vectors. All vectors are stored in a high-dimensional indexing structure called LSH, a probabilistic indexing scheme that makes use of multiple hashing instances in parallel. At retrieval time, small segments of audio matches are retrieved from the index and pieced together using the Hough Transform technique, and results are used as the basis to rank candidate matches. 1.

40|$|James Miles of The Economist was in Tibet {{when the}} riots and protests started on March 14. China’s strict {{limitations}} on foreign journalists entering Tibet {{in the following}} days made Miles {{one of the few}} journalists who saw the riots firsthand. With all the attention being now paid to how the international media are covering the events in Tibet, {{we thought it would be}} interesting to find out how Miles felt about the questions he got upon returning from the field. Here’s how he answered us via email. China Beat: Is there any question that you’ve been asked a lot since returning to Beijing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> off the mark or plays into simplistic or misleading thinking about a complex issue? James Miles: No. The question I get asked most is what happened, and then why. What happened in Lhasa from midday on the 14 th to late on the 15 th did not fit the normal pattern of unrest in Tibet. It was not monk-led, it displayed little explicitly-stated political purpose, and it was violent. Reporters who interviewed me during the unrest and afterwards seemed to readily understand this. If I were a media studies specialist I’d have a very good look at this case. The foreign media were almost entirely absent from Lhasa (a couple may have sneaked in under cover after the riots broke out but would have had limited access). Yet I have seen some very good reporting on what happened, notwithstanding the Chinese media’s nitpicking. Reporting in the official press, by contrast, while reasonably on the mark as far as the violence goes, has been highly misleading by failing to look at the bigger picture of unrest in Tibet and beyond, by not asking what might have caused this anger and by portraying this as the actions of a handful of people organised by the Dalai Lama’s “clique. ” It wasn’t a handful, and I saw no evidence to suggest anything other than spontaneity...|$|E
