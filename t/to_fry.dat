5|$|Traditionally, lard is used <b>to</b> <b>fry</b> the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used <b>to</b> <b>fry</b> chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E
25|$|Since some cooking {{vessels and}} {{utensils}} (such as ceramic dishes and wooden spoons) are porous, {{it is possible}} for them to become infused with the taste of certain foods and transfer this taste to other foods. For example, if a frying pan is used <b>to</b> <b>fry</b> beef sausage, and is then used a few hours later <b>to</b> <b>fry</b> an omelette with cheese, a slight taste of the sausage might linger.|$|E

25|$|The {{inclusion}} of Tate in the England side {{appears to have}} been a result of friction between MacLaren and the selectors (and in particular their Chairman, Lord Hawke) that had developed during the course of the series. According <b>to</b> <b>Fry,</b> the selectors included Tate in the twelve (he was a late addition to the eleven originally selected) because they thought that MacLaren could not possibly pick him and would therefore have to play their preferred eleven. However, MacLaren was supposedly annoyed that Haigh was not included, and therefore on the morning of the match chose Tate for the final eleven in preference to Hirst. However, Tate had been having a great season, eventually finishing second in the first-class wicket tallies behind Rhodes, and an argument could be made for his inclusion.|$|E

The resulting explosion sent small bits of shrapnel and other fragments into the crowd of spectators and caused the American patrons of the bars and clubs on the Mexican side of the border to rush back to their side of the line. Among the casualties were a reporter and a photographer, along with many others, but nobody was killed and all of the injuries were considered minor.

500|$|Before the {{industrialization}} {{of chicken}} production, {{and the creation}} of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. (This method is common in Australia.) Another method is <b>to</b> <b>fry</b> the chicken pieces using a pan fried method. The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid, usually, a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in. This process (of flouring, frying and simmering in gravy) is known as [...] "smothering" [...] and can be used for other tough cuts of meat, such as swiss steak. Smothered chicken is still consumed today, though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens, or who seek out stewing hens, it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens.|$|E
