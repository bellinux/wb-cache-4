50|$|The {{long-term}} effects of batroxobin are tested on rats and Macaca mulatta. The subjects received an injection of batroxobin once a day for 30 consecutive days. In rats the batroxobin had pharmacological and <b>toxicological</b> <b>effects</b> on the hematology system and liver. There was a decrease of fibrinogen. The effects were reversible. In Macaca mulatta, the fibrinogen concentration was significantly decreased and the decrease was dose-dependent. There was a local inflammatory reaction in the injection sites of the animals.

The conclusion was that batroxobin has pharmacological and <b>toxicological</b> <b>effects</b> on the hematology system of Macaca mulatta and the effects are reversible.|$|E

40|$|A QSAR {{approach}} was proposed to assess <b>toxicological</b> joint <b>effects</b> {{based on the}} mechanism of chemical-chemical interactions between cyanogenic toxicants and aldehydes. It has been observed that the chemical-chemical interaction between cyanogenic toxicants and aldehydes resulted {{in the formation of}} carbanion intermediates, and therefore this interaction led to different <b>toxicological</b> joint <b>effects</b> between cyanogenic toxicants and aldehydes. Analysis of this chemical-chemical interaction showed that the formation of carbanion intermediate highly depended on the charge of the carbon atom in the -CHO of aldehydes and this of the carbon atom (C*) in the carbochain of cyanogenic toxicant. By using the Hammett Constant (sgrp) to measure the charge of carbon atom in the -CHO of aldehydes, a mechanism-based QSAR approach (M= 0. 316 - 4. 386 sgrp with r 2 = 0. 933, SE= 0. 082, F= 55. 389, p= 0. 002, M=sum of toxic units) was proposed to assess the <b>toxicological</b> joint <b>effects</b> between -hydroxy-isobutyronitrile and individual aliphatic aldehydes. Another one (M= 0. 978 - 0. 720 sgrp with r 2 = 0. 852, SE= 0. 152, F= 40. 148, p= 0. 0001) was also proposed to assess the <b>toxicological</b> joint <b>effects</b> between -hydroxy-isobutyronitrile and individual aromatic aldehydes. Lastly, by using the charge of carbon atom (C*) in the carbochain of cyanogenic toxicant, a mechanism-based QSAR model (M=- 0. 161 - 7. 721 C* with r 2 = 0. 847, SE= 0. 227, F= 27. 657, p= 0. 003) was derived to assess <b>toxicological</b> joint <b>effects</b> between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and cyanogenic toxicants.

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} {{toxicological}} testing strategies aimed at identifying the toxic effects of chemicals without (or with a minimal) recourse to animal experimentation {{is an important}} issue for toxicological regulations and for industrial decision-making. This article describes an original approach which enables the design of substance-tailored testing strategies with a specified performance in terms of false-positive and false-negative rates. The outcome of toxicological testing is simulated in a different way than previously published articles on the topic. Indeed, toxicological outcomes are simulated not only {{as a function of the}} performance of toxicological tests but also as a function of the physico-chemical Properties of chemicals. The required inputs for Our approach are QSAR predictions for the LOAELs of the <b>toxicological</b> <b>effect</b> of interest and statistical distributions describing the relationship existing between in vivo LOAEL values and results from in vitro tests. Our methodology is able to correctly predict the performance of testing strategies designed to analyze the teratogenic effects of two chemicals: di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate and Indomethacin. The proposed decision-support methodology can be adapted to any toxicological context as long as a Statistical Comparison between in vitro and in Vivo results is possible and QSAR models for the <b>toxicological</b> <b>effect</b> of interest can be developed...|$|R
