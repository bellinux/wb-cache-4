500|$|Originally, Constable was {{a member}} of the Whig party, likely due to the close {{friendship}} of his father-in-law and Henry Clay. Due mainly to frustrations over how the Whig party had treated him, Constable decided to switch parties. He is quoted as saying, [...] "that the party was dominated by old fogies who are indifferent to younger men." [...] His inclination toward the Democratic Party almost led to a fistfight between himself and Lincoln in a tavern in Paris, Illinois. Lincoln was quoted as saying, [...] "Mr. Constable, I understand you perfectly, and have noticed for some time <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> slowly and cautiously picking your way over to the Democratic party." [...] After this heated exchange, the men reconciled, but by 1856 Lincoln claimed that Constable had left the party. In 1858, Constable was the Illinois elector at-large for the election of President James Buchanan, a Democrat.|$|E

H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: [...] "Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have put in your claim? It is above a year and a day <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> married, and I never once heard either of you mention a journey to Whichnoure." [...] Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes [...] "... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by all I have said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it." [...] Walpole concludes, [...] "If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither." ...|$|E

"The most {{important}} thing to bear in mind when arrested is that you are a volunteer of a revolutionary Army, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> captured by an enemy force, that your cause is a just one, that you are right and that the enemy is wrong and that as a soldier you have taken the chance expected of a soldier and that there is {{nothing to be ashamed of}} in being captured.|$|E
