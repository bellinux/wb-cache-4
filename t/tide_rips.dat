The value of such {{measurements}} became immediately obvious as the Drift took advantage of her own observations in sailing and in a cited incident observed another ship struggling while she used currents effectively. During October–November the ship attempted further work but anchoring and effective measurements were obstructed by weather so the vessel returned to New York {{at the end of}} November. During this season, and subsequent work in the area the presence and location of <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> was noted. There, while undertaking some hydrographic investigations in the entrance to New York harbor Drift was slightly damaged in a winter [...] "hurricane" [...] with temperature at 10°F (-12°C) during which she had to be towed away from the shore by two tugs. The report of the incident noted three other schooners and a steamboat were [...] "thrown on the beach by the hurricane." [...] After refit the Drift returned to the Gulf of Maine for current measurements. The schooner continued to occupy stations between Cape Sable and Nantucket observing currents and <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> as well as incidental hydrography. Also noted as observed was [...] "what seemed to be a very large round spar projecting twelve to fifteen feet out of the sea" [...] that appeared on one side and then the other of the vessel while becalmed off Race Point, Cape Cod and [...] "near it an object having the form of an enormous dorsal fin" [...] that was observed with [...] "good glasses."

60|$|We had {{now turned}} southward towards Kaa, {{following}} a shapeless bridle-track {{which is the}} high road of Hawaii. The sea was on one hand. Our way was across--the woods we threaded did but cling upon--the vast declivity of the island front. For long, as we still skirted {{the margin of the}} forest, we kept an open view of the whole falling seaboard, the white edge of surf now soundless to our ears, and the high blue sea marbled by <b>tide</b> <b>rips,</b> and showing under the clouds of an opalescent milky white. The height, the breeze, the giddy gradient of the isle, delighted me. I observed a spider plant its abhorred St. Andrew's cross against the sea and sky, certainly fifty yards from where I rode, and five feet at least from either tree: so wide was its death-gossamer spread, so huge the ugly vermin.|$|E

50|$|Amchitka Pass is a strait in Alaska, United States. It {{is located}} in the Aleutian Islands on the 180th meridian, between the Rat Islands group to the west and the Delarof Islands to the east. Amchitka Pass has a least width of 50 miles and depths of 49 to over 1,000 fathoms. The islands {{on both sides of the}} pass should be cleared by at least 5 miles. Heavy <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> have been {{observed}} off the east end of Amchitka Island. The pass is dangerous in heavy weather, particularly for small and medium craft; currents appear erratic in direction and velocities may be strong. This may account for reports of very large seas and strong <b>tide</b> <b>rips.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{vicinity}} of the passes and in the passes, the tidal currents are strong and their directions uncertain. The current sets southward during the falling tide and northward during the rising tide, which is the longer and stronger of the two. Its velocity varies, but in Unalga Pass, where it is greatest, it {{has been found to be}} 61 knots an hour during the whole of the tide, and the current turned to the opposite direction at the same velocity in twenty minutes. At ordinary times the tidal current does not amount to more than three or four knots. On the Bering Sea side of Unalga and Akutan passes, with a strong northerly or northwesterly wind, heavy <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> are raised. These do not extend through the passes, but seem to be confined to the Bering Sea side from about the middle of Unalga Island almost to Cape Kalekhta. With the ebb tide, a southerly wind does not seem to raise corresponding rips on the Pacific side. When the <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> are heavy, the water is broken into heavy, choppy seas from every direction. Uniinak Pass is comparatively free from <b>tide</b> <b>rips.</b> In ordinary weather it is high or low water in Akutan Pass between one and two hours before high or low water at Dutch Harbor.|$|E

5000|$|Seneka Point (Russian: Mys Seneka) is a steep {{point in}} the western Sea of Okhotsk. It has sheer cliffs that are 152 m (500 ft) high and grayish-brown in color.

50|$|Currently, {{the pass}} {{is used by}} BC Ferries' {{passenger}} and vehicle ferry runs between Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal at Tsawwassen, Lower Mainland, the southern Gulf Islands and Swartz Bay Ferry Terminal at Swartz Bay, Vancouver Island. Because the pass is very narrow like a river, the ferries pass extremely close to its shores. It is also used by pleasure craft, fishing boats, freighters and freight ferries, making it very 'active' commercially as well. However, strong eddies and <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> are always present in the pass, making it a hazardous corridor for smaller vessels to transit.|$|E
50|$|From the southward and eastward, {{bound for}} Bering Sea, {{there are three}} passes used by deep-draft vessels, known collectively as the Fox Islands Passes, and {{respectively}} as Unimak, Akutan, and Unalga passes. The largest and most desirable one to use in thick and foggy weather is the eastern one, Unimak Pass. This is clear of hidden dangers, the widest of the three, and is comparatively free from <b>tide</b> <b>rips.</b> It is especially recommended for sailing vessels, and for steamers bound direct to the northward. Akutan and Unalga passes are convenient for steam vessels bound to Unalaska Bay, but, being narrow and having strong currents and <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> at times, are not recommended for sailing vessels bound north. A fair wind is almost necessary for the passage, and from the southward this would bring fog. The pass between Ashmiak and Ugamok islands on the east and Sea Lion Island on the west may be clear of dangers, {{but it is not}} recommended. All of the other minor passes between Unimak and Akutan passes are known to be full of rocks and reefs. The mountains in this vicinity would be excellent landmarks if they could be seen, but in summer they are almost always obscured by fogs or low-lying clouds. The lower hills and islands and objects near the sea level furnish the available landmarks. In coming from the southward or eastward in clear weather, and if bound through Akutan or Unalga passes, it is recommended to steer for Tigalda Island as the first land to be made. It is high and prominent, and when once made a course can be shaped for any of the three passes.|$|E

50|$|Iony Island is {{the only}} island in the Sea of Okhotsk that {{is located in the}} open sea. All other islands in the Okhotsk Sea are either coastal islands or they belong to the Kuril island chain. It is 1.6 km (1 mi) in length and 850 m (0.53 mi) wide and rises to a height of 165 m (541 ft). The island is barren and conical in shape with sheer cliffs rising to heights of 30 to 45 m (98 to 148 ft). Several rocks lie off the island, {{including}} a group of four 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) high rocks about 800 m (about 0.5 mi) to the north-northwest and several detached rocks 160 to 320 m (0.1 to 0.2 mi) to the south. The island is often enveloped in dense fog due to cold bottom water upwelling to the surface. The flood tidal current off the island sets west, while the ebb sets to the east or east-southeast. These currents may reach up to 1.5 to 2 knots during spring tides and create numerous eddies, small whirlpools, and <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> around the island for some distance offshore.|$|E
50|$|Unalga Pass is {{the small}} pass between Unalga and Unalaska islands. It is the narrowest and {{shortest}} of the three passes, and is more generally used by steamers bound to and from Unalaska Bay than either of the other two. It is about one mile wide in its narrowest part, and, {{with the exception of}} rocks above water which make out a short distance from the points of Unalaska Island, the pass is considered free from dangers. In the middle of the pass there are depths of 25 to 35 fathoms, with deeper water northwestward and southeastward. Its worst features are the strong tidal currents and <b>tide</b> <b>rips,</b> both of which are generally considered worse in this pass than in either of the other two; williwaws of great force are also experienced -in this pass. The advantage of using this pass in thick weather is that the shore of Unalga Island is clear of dangers, and when made can be followed close enough to keep it in sight while going through. The Signals, Egg Island, and Old Man are the prominent landmarks for making Unalga Pass from the southeastward.|$|E

5000|$|Unimak Pass (...) is {{the widest}} of the Fox Islands Passes, being 9 or 10 miles wide in its narrowest part. It is clear of hidden dangers, free from {{dangerous}} <b>tide</b> <b>rips,</b> and the tidal current has less velocity {{than in the}} other passes. Except near shore, it is free of sudden blasts of wind descending from the mountainous coast to the sea, known as williwaws. It is the most desirable pass for sailing vessels, and also for all vessels not calling at Unalaska Bay. In approaching from the southward and eastward, {{care must be taken}} to keep clear of Sannak Reefs and Anderson and Lenard rocks. If very clear, the mountains of Unimak Island may be made out and the course for Unimak Pass shaped accordingly; but under ordinary conditions the hills back of Cape Khituk, or Ugamok Island, will be the first land sighted. If the weather is thick, soundings on Davidson Bank will be of use in feeling the way in to the land. In the vicinity of Cape Khituk the coast is bold and free from outlying dangers. A reef of rocks was formerly shown on the chart extending between 1 and 2 miles from the east end of Ugamok Island. The IMO Maritime Safety Committee per IMO SN.1/Circ.331 adopted five 'Areas to Be Avoided' (ATBA) in the region of the Aleutian Island Archipelago {{in order to reduce the}} risk of a marine casualty and resulting pollution and damage to the environment. These new ATBAs will come into effect on January 1, 2016.The five ATBAs apply to vessels solely in transit through the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean and in most areas extends no further than 50 nautical miles from the shoreline of the islands. The 50 nautical mile buffer zone is designed to allow for the repair of, or time to launch an emergency response effort to any marine casualty before it runs aground and damages the fragile ecosystem. The establishment of the ATBA adds minimal distance to a voyage.\Akutan Pass is about 3 miles wide in its narrowest part. There are four small islets (Gull Rocks) on the western side of the pass, less than % mile from Unalga Island, with many detached rocks above water in the same group, but not extending beyond the islets into the pass. There is a reef with some pinnacle rocks on it extending from Cape Morgan not more than ^ mile into the pass. With these exceptions there are no known dangers. The current and <b>tide</b> <b>rips</b> are not so strong as in Unalga Pass. On this account, and because of its greater width and the fact that a straight course will carry through, this pass is preferred by many to Unalga Pass.|$|E
