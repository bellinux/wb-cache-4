25|$|For {{occupant}} comfort, {{the building}} has a <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper,</b> which also negates much of the wind load. The damper is electrically activated, so if power failed, say during a hurricane, the damper might not turn on and a much lower-speed wind would suffice; wind of this speed occurs on average once in 16 years. LeMessurier also discovered that his firm had used New York City's truss safety factor of 1:1 instead of the column safety factor of 1:2. These factors, combined, put the building in critical danger.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three types}} of semi-active vibration absorbers, which are designed to control the response and sound radiation of a thin plate at low audio frequencies. Semi-active control systems are used to tune the absorbers to the resonance frequencies {{of the first three}} flexural natural modes of the plate where they are mounted. The first configuration consists of three axial <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> dampers, which are properly adjusted and distributed on the plate so that each of them controls one of the first three flexural modes of the plate. The second configuration consists of a single axial switching <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> that can switch to different states characterised by discrete values of the suspension stiffness and mechanical damping. At each state the parameters are set to control one of the first three flexural modes of the plate. Finally the third configuration consists of a single three-axis <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> whose <b>mass</b> oscillates axially and rotates around two cross axis. This device is also located and tuned to control the first three flexural modes of the plate. The simulation study shows that the three axial <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> dampers reduce the flexural kinetic energy of the plate by about 17 dB around the first three resonance frequencies and about 8 dB around the fourth and fifth resonance frequencies. Thus large control effects are produced in the low frequency range between 30 and 150 Hz. The single axial switching <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> produces about 14 dB reductions around the first three resonances and 3 dB and 7 dB around the fourth and fifth resonances respectively. Finally the single three-axis <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> generates about 21 dB reductions around the first three resonance frequencies and about 9 dB reductions around the fourth resonance frequency. Thus the proposed single axial and single three-axis <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> dampers produce comparatively similar results as the three axial <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> dampers with the same total mass. In particular it is shown that the best location for the single three-axis <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> should be chosen either in the centre or inner centre of the polygon defined by the border of the plate. The control performance of the single three-axis <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> has also been compared with that produced by an active velocity feedback loop using an inertial electromagnetic actuator with equivalent proof mass. The simulation study shows that the activesystem outperforms the single three-axis <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> only around the first resonance frequency, where it produces 7 dB larger reduction of the flexural kinetic energy. However this result is obtained with large feedback control gains and at the expenses of low frequency control spillover. When a smaller and more realistic control gain is implemented, the control effects become comparable to that of a single three-axis <b>tune</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the modal parameters identification and of the continuous monitoring of two arches built in the new area of Expo 2015 in Milan. The activities on the arches were performed during the erection stage and they were planned as a consequence of preliminary studies performed at Politecnico di Milano wind tunnel, that highlighted dynamic instability due to the wind. In particular, the first two bending modes of the structures showed a critical behaviour and for this reason a TMD (<b>Tuned</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Damping)</b> system was designed in order to control these modes. At first, frequencies, damping and modal deflected shapes were evaluated in order to check the numerical FEM model, to tune the TMD system and to check its correct functioning. The two arches were then monitored for several months to observe their dynamic behaviour under different wind conditions. A good database about the strongest and the most frequent winds in the site was obtained. The accelerations registered under strong wind conditions did not reach dangerous levels for the structures, moreover these results showed a good agreement with the wind tunnel ones...|$|R

Aircraft warning lights were installed atop the memorial in early 2006, and security lighting installed in the parking lots.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damping</b> (TMD) system in {{building}} structures with hybrid functionsvibration control and energy harvesting. The regenerative electromagnetic TMD (EM-TMD) system comprises a pendulum-type TMD, a rotary electromagnetic (EM) damper and an energy-harvesting circuit. The structural vibration energy induced by earthquake or wind, {{which is a}} great amount, is absorbed by EM-TMD and converted to electrical energy by the EM damper, and stored in energy storage elements (such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries) by the energy harvesting circuit. As a result, the proposed EM -TMD systems can not only effectively protect building structures against excessive vibrations, but also provide regenerative and economical power sources to smart wireless sensing system or other electronic devices. This paper presents a proof-of-concept shaking table experiment in which a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model equipped with a regenerative EM-TMD system has been tested. A prototype of rotary EM damper connected with two types of energy harvesting circuits, were tested and compared in this study. Three important properties, i. e., energy conversion efficiency, output power and control effect, were investigated and discussed. The results successfully validate the feasibility of conducting vibration control and energy harvesting simultaneously using regenerative EM-TMD system in buildings.

2500|$|The <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damper</b> {{system was}} used by several teams, notably Renault, during {{the latter part of}} 2005 and the 2006 seasons. The devices were located in the nosecone, and were {{particularly}} effective in corners and over kerbs to keep the tyres in closer contact to the track surface than they would otherwise be. After the French Grand Prix, the FIA announced that the system would be outlawed. This had a particularly significant effect on Renault, as the team had effectively built their cars around the devices, and had introduced them as long ago as the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix. At the German Grand Prix the Renault team submitted one of their cars for scrutineering by the race stewards, who ruled that the devices were acceptable. The FIA launched an appeal against this decision, and on 23 August 2006 the FIA International Court of Appeal issued a statement upholding this appeal and rejecting the stewards' decision. The Court of Appeal stated that the system infringed part of the bodywork section (Article 3.15) of the Formula One Technical Regulations, which stated that any specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance had to: comply with the rules relating to bodywork, be rigidly secured to the entirely sprung part of the car (rigidly secured means not having any degree of freedom), and remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car. The central argument was whether the mass dampers function as aerodynamic devices or {{as a part of the}} suspension system. The FIA reasoned that because the devices did not [...] "remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car", they were illegal. But the FIA failed to explain how the damper, which was entirely enclosed with the car can be counted as bodywork when article 1.4 of the regulations defined bodywork as: ...|$|E
30|$|It {{is evident}} from above studies that dynamic forces {{in the form of}} {{periodic}} moving loads from train may result in undesirable resonant responses of the bridge. These undesirable responses can be controlled using the TMD, MTMD and VED. However, TMD and MTMD are having disadvantages of being sensitive to the fluctuation in frequency spacing and tuning frequency with respect to the controlling (fundamental) frequency of the bridge. This may deteriorate the performance of TMD and MTMD. Until the date, the resonant response control of bridge is studied using TMD, MTMD and VED, but the use of friction dampers (FD) and <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> friction <b>damper</b> (TMFD) has not been explored for controlling the response of the bridges. Pisal and Jangid (2015) demonstrated that MTMFD can effectively reduce the seismic response of multi-storey structures.|$|R
30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of multiple <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> friction dampers (MTMFD) for vibration control of structure over a single <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> friction <b>damper</b> (STMFD) is investigated. A five story structure supported with MTMFD is considered and the governing differential {{equations of motion}} are derived. The response of the structure under four selected earthquake ground motions is obtained by solving the equations of motion numerically using the state space method. The number of damper in MTMFD is varied and the response of five story structure with STMFD is compared with {{the response of the}} same structure with MTMFD. A parametric study is also conducted to investigate the effects of important parameters such as number of dampers in MTMFD, <b>damper</b> frequency spacing, <b>mass</b> ratio, <b>tuning</b> ratio and damper slip force. It is found that for a given structural system and level of excitation an optimum value of the parameters (i.e. frequency spacing, tuning ratio and damper slip force) exists at which the peak displacement of structure attains its minimum value. The response time history of the structure with STMFD and MTMFD with respect to their optimum parameters is compared. It is found that the MTMFD is more effective in controlling the response of the structure in comparison with the STMFD having the same mass.|$|R

The present study specifically addresses the working of TMFD. The advantage of TMFD is that it can work as an FD when mass is slipping and as an added mass when the mass is in stick state. In this paper, the performance of a TMFD attached to a damped linear SDOF structure is investigated under seismic and harmonic excitations. The specific objectives of the study are: (1) to formulate the equations of motion and develop solution procedure for the response of SDOF structure with TMFD, under harmonic and seismic excitations, numerically; (2) to investigate the existence of different modes of vibration; (3) to investigate the influence of important parameters such as <b>mass</b> ratio, <b>tuning</b> frequency ratio and damper slip force on the performance of TMFD; (4) to obtain the optimum values of important parameters such as tuning frequency ratio and damper slip force for different mass ratios of TMFD; and (5) to compare the response of SDOF structure attached with TMFD to the response of same structure without TMFD.|$|R
30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> friction <b>damper</b> (TMFD) in reducing undesirable resonant {{response of the}} bridge subjected to multi-axle vehicular load is investigated. A Taiwan high-speed railway (THSR) bridge subjected to Japanese SKS (Salkesa) train load is considered. The bridge is idealized as a simply supported Euler–Bernoulli beam with uniform properties throughout {{the length of the}} bridge, and the train’s vehicular load is modeled as a series of moving forces. Simplified model of vehicle, bridge and TMFD system has been considered to derive coupled differential equations of motion which is solved numerically using the Newmark’s linear acceleration method. The critical train velocities at which the bridge undergoes resonant vibration are investigated. Response of the bridge is studied for three different arrangements of TMFD systems, namely, TMFD attached at mid-span of the bridge, multiple <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> friction dampers (MTMFD) system concentrated at mid-span of the bridge and MTMFD system with distributed TMFD units {{along the length of the}} bridge. The optimum parameters of each TMFD system are found out. It has been demonstrated that an optimized MTMFD system concentrated at mid-span of the bridge is more effective than an optimized TMFD at the same place with the same total mass and an optimized MTMFD system having TMFD units distributed along the length of the bridge. However, the distributed MTMFD system is more effective than an optimized TMFD system, provided that TMFD units of MTMFD system are distributed within certain limiting interval and the frequency of TMFD units is appropriately distributed.|$|R

40|$|A {{new class}} of {{adaptive}} passive stiffness systems undergoing nonlinear oscillations are proposed and studied in this Ph. D. thesis. Adaptive passive stiffness systems that have been proposed in this thesis and by other researchers recently allow for new ways of vibration isolation, seismic protection, and <b>tuned</b> <b>mass</b> <b>damping</b> of vibrations. New characteristics which emerge in these adaptive passive stiffness systems, like the coexistence of negative stiffness and positive stiffness, pose the need of analytical methods for studying these systems. Existing analytical and computational techniques that permit such a study are explored and new techniques are developed. A new analytical technique called the multi-frequency homotopy analysis method is proposed to this end. This multi-frequency homotopy analysis method can not only be adopted to solve {{a wide variety of}} nonlinear problems with periodic and quasi-periodic steadystate solutions, but can also be utilized to obtain analytical expressions of nonlinear dynamic systems’ transient response. These abilities of the multi-frequency homotopy analysis method make it a powerful tool for studying the new adaptive passive stiffness systems. Besides, the pseudo-force method is adapted to analytically solve a nonlinear system involving negative stiffness. Other analytical and numerical methods like the modified Lindstedt–Poincar´e method, the event-driven simulation technique and the time stepping method are also explored for analyzing such adaptive passive stiffness systems. In this Ph. D. study, a new adaptive passive stiffness device called universal stiffness devices (USD) is proposed. The newly proposed USD can generate a wide range of smooth and piecewise smooth restoring forces with positive as well as negative stiffnesses. The stiffness of the USD can be changed smoothly and continuously by simply adjusting a physical parameter of the USD. The variability of the USD’s stiffness can provide retuning capability of vibration isolation systems and other control systems with such a USD. The proposed USD can serve as a core element in a vibration isolation system to adaptively attenuate the vibration transmitted to the primary structure. Moreover, as an adaptive passive device, the USD brings better adaptability than a purely passive system. An analytical model of the USD has been established and experimental study has been conducted. The force–displacement loops of the USD are measured and compared to the results computed by using the newly formulated analytical model. The USD’s capability of changing its stiffness as it is designed has been tested. The performance of a vibration isolation system with the proposed USD has been verified experimentally under a range of harmonic excitations that cover dominant vibration frequencies and amplitudes. For future research, further application of the proposed analytical method for investigating nonlinear vibration isolation systems of different types could be expected; more practical applications of the proposed USD in vibration control and hazard reduction can be explored...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRandom {{uncertainties}} in {{finite element}} models in linear structural dynamics are usually modeled by using parametric models. This means that: (1) the uncertain local parameters occurring in the global <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices of the finite element model have to he identified; (2) appropriate probabilistic models of these uncertain parameters have to be constructed; and (3) functions mapping the domains of uncertain parameters into the global <b>mass,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness matrices have to be constructed.
