40|$|In this paper, mineralogy, grain size, dissemination, textural {{consistency}} and mineral associations were determined for a commercially exploited porphyry copper ore using a Mineral Liberation Analyser (MLA). The ore {{was subjected to}} high power density microwave <b>treatments</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single mode <b>cavity</b> at 15 kW and approximately 2 kW h/t. The untreated and microwave-treated samples were subsequently milled to two grind sizes near the nominal plant grind size and a size-by-liberation analysis performed. The analysis revealed that equivalent liberation could be obtained at a grind size approximately 50 – 60 μm coarser than the nominal plant grind due to the microwave treatment. Flotation testing indicated that <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> copper recovery of approximately 1 % could be achieved, or that a grind size increase of approximately 30 μm may potentially yield equivalent copper recovery due to the microwave-enhanced liberation observed. However, statistical analyses demonstrated {{that it is difficult}} to attain confidence in recovery increases of approximately 1 % even when conducting batch flotation tests in triplicate. The ore under investigation had previously been shown to produce only modest average reductions in strength (∼ 8 %) under similar microwave treatment conditions due to a prevalence of many unfavourable textures. However, the preferential association of copper minerals with a hard matrix mineral (quartz) and a hard microwave-absorbent mineral (pyrite) resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significant change <b>in</b> liberation behaviour...|$|R
