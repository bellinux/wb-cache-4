5000|$|Tables {{for class}} 8 are fully faceted and details are {{expressed}} through combination with common auxiliaries of language (<b>Table</b> <b>1c)</b> {{and a series}} of special auxiliary tables to indicate other facets or attributes in Linguistics or Literature. As a result, this class allows for great specificity in indexing although the schedules themselves occupy very little space in UDC. The subdivisions of e.g. 811 Languages or 821 Literature are derived from common auxiliaries of language =1/=9 (<b>Table</b> <b>1c)</b> by substituting a point for the equals sign, e.g. 811.111 English language (as a subject of a linguistic study) and 821.111 English literature derives from =111 English language. Common auxiliaries of place and time are also frequently used in this class to express place and time facets of Linguistics or Literature, e.g. 821.111(71)"18" [...] English literature of Canada in 19th century 80 General questions relating to both linguistics and literature.
