25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{conclusion}} of the Rose Bowl, Sanchez stated it would be [...] "hard to say goodbye to [...] I don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] However, with the subsequent announcement that other NFL-caliber quarterbacks, such as Sam Bradford, Tim Tebow, and Colt McCoy had decided to stay in school, rumors arose that Sanchez would use the opportunity to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. On January 15, Sanchez announced his plans to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the 2009 NFL Draft, although he continued as a USC student and completed work on his degree in the spring of 2009 while preparing for the draft.|$|E
500|$|After {{the speech}} Kennedy took a {{chartered}} plane to Washington D.C. As it approached the city, the passengers could see smoke rising from fires started during the riots. Kennedy asked the pilot to circle again {{to get another}} view. Upon landing, Kennedy proposed driving into the riot zone to calm down the mobs, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> something with these people." [...] Most of his aides were shocked at the idea. Fred Dutton, attempting to delay, suggested that Kennedy inform Mayor Walter Washington of his plans as a courtesy. John Bartlow Martin told him that little could be done while people were still rioting, {{and that he would}} appear to be grandstanding. Kennedy then reluctantly went home.|$|E
500|$|While Oasis' {{first two}} singles, [...] "Supersonic" [...] and [...] "Shakermaker", were {{modestly}} received, it was [...] "Live Forever" [...] that [...] "got the world's attention". [...] "Live Forever" [...] became Oasis' first top ten hit, reaching number ten on the British singles charts in 1994. In 1995, the song became the band's first chart {{success in the}} United States, reaching number two and ten on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively. Noel Gallagher commented on the praise given to the song: [...] "People said to me after 'Live Forever', 'Where are you gonna go after that?' And I was like, I don't think it's that good. I think it's a fucking good song, but I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{that same}} episode of Raw Is War, Foley then reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked {{shirt with a}} loose necktie and ended his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, the two competed in the second-ever Hell in a Cell match in June 1998 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were {{discussing}} the previous year's Hell in a Cell (which took place at Badd Blood in October) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming {{ideas about how to}} top that match when Funk said, laughing, [...] "Maybe you should let him throw you {{off the top of the}} cage", Foley replied: [...] "Yeah," [...] I shot back, [...] "then I could climb back up – and he could throw me off again." [...] Man, that was a good one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage. After a while I got serious and said quietly to Terry, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The same year, Bimal Roy {{cast her}} as Chandramukhi {{opposite}} Dilip Kumar in the critically acclaimed Devdas, {{which was the}} adaptation of the novel with same title by Sharat Chandra Chatterji. The industry initially was not in favour of this choice when they heard about Vyjayanthimala being cast in Bimal Roy's film, the response being: [...] "Why don't you take comedian Kishore Kumar as Devdas?". Initially Nargis was selected for Chandramukhi's role, but she {{refused to accept the}} role. The role was later offered to Bina Rai and Suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of Paro, which was earlier offered to Meena Kumari. Subsequently, the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point Vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of Chandramukhi, where she said to Bimal Roy, [...] "I am ready if you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it". On the other hand, Nabendu Ghosh, the script writer of Devdas, said that, [...] "I did not approve of Vyjayanthimala , but we had no option – no one wanted to play Chandramukhi, and we were committed to our distributors... She was, of course, a very good actress, but she was too young for Chandramukhi, as envisioned by Saratbabu". On her performance, Rediff wrote: [...] "Vyjayanthimala imbues Chandramukhi with true sympathy. Who better than Chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless love?... Vyjayanthimala, a star after the blockbuster Nagin, still had to establish her acting credentials when Roy went against the tide and cast her in the role of Chandramukhi". While Upperstall.com describes her performance as: [...] "Vyjayantimala's Chandramukhi is embellished with her graceful dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman, who, in love with Devdas, has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman. For Vyjayantimala, the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics, offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her, the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema– her dance". Subsequently, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress but refused to accept it, stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by Suchitra Sen and not supporting. In 2006, a poll conducted by Rediff ranked her role of Chandramukhi {{as one of the best}} Tawaif characters in Bollywood. Subsequently, the same role was listed in The Times of India's [...] "10 Celluloid Hookers You Loved" [...] at number six by Nikhat Kazmi. Though the film was critically successful, it did not garner much support at the box office and ended up as 10th highest-grossing movie of 1955 with an average verdict [...]|$|E
