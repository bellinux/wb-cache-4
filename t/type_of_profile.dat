Because of the large amounts <b>of</b> <b>profile</b> data produced by realistic program runs, most work has focused on separately collecting and compressing different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>profiles.</b> In this paper, we present a unified representation <b>of</b> <b>profiles</b> called Whole Execution Trace (WET), which includes the complete information contained in each <b>of</b> the above <b>types</b> <b>of</b> traces.

To perform many of the assassinations and other tasks, the player must consider the use of commands distinguished by its <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>profile.</b> Low-profile commands allow Altaïr to: blend into nearby crowds, pass by other citizens, or other non-threatening tasks {{that can be used to}} hide and reduce the alertness level; the player can also use Altaïr's retractable blade to attempt low-profile assassinations. High-profile commands are more noticeable, and include: running, scaling the sides of buildings to climb to higher vantage points, and attacking foes; performing these actions at certain times may raise the local area's awareness level. Once the area is at high alert, the crowds run and scatter while guards attempt to chase and bring down Altaïr; to reduce the alert level, the player must control Altaïr as to break the guards' line of sight and then find a hiding space, such as a haystack or rooftop garden; or blend in with the citizens sitting on benches or wandering scholars. Should the player be unable to escape the guards, they can fight back using swordplay maneuvers.|$|E
