5000|$|Importantly for sunset provisions, the Byrd Rule also {{defines as}} {{extraneous}} provisions that [...] "...would increase the deficit for a fiscal year beyond those {{covered by the}} reconciliation measure." [...] Since the Budget Act says the budget resolution covers at least the four years following the budget year, which is typically the year following the year it was adopted, that is the usual period of time. However, budget resolutions have covered periods as long as ten years, so a reconciliation measure may cover the ten years. This rule {{has the effect of}} allowing congress members to raise a point of order against any spending increase or <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>that</b> does not contain a sunset provision that ends it after five or ten years (conceivably longer). (Otherwise, the provision increases the deficit in a fiscal year after the period covered by the budget resolution.) Overcoming a point of order requires cloture, and thus a three-fifths majority of 60 in the Senate. In short, a net effect of the Byrd Rule is to require that any spending increase or tax cut be approved by a majority of 60 if it does not contain a sunset provision. This is intended to assure there is no increase in the deficit after the budget resolution period (though there is an exception if the total effect on the deficit in a particular title is to not increase the deficit, the point of order is not triggered). With the sunset provision, only a simple majority is necessary in the budget reconciliation process.|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} six years, our state governments have {{experienced}} a time of tremendous prosperity. Revenues have grown and taxes have been lowered.

A slowing economy and a massive federal <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>that</b> mostly benefits the privileged classes have changed the nature of this environment. State tax revenues are not growing at the same rate as in previous years. The $ 1. 35 trillion federal tax cut will lead to less federal revenue in at least some areas of public service. Because of the links between state tax systems and the federal tax structure, the tax cut will also mean lower state tax revenues. By itself, the elimination of the estate tax will cause states to lose an additional $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion from their own tax collections over the next 10 years. As a result, states can expect harder times—and in many cases they are already experiencing them.
