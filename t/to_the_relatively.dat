5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as yellow or orange, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their chequered patterns. Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its sulphur yellow flowers. Calochortus (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> short {{growing season}} for sugar {{producing}} crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. There are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops {{to be used}} to this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> vast {{distances}} between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to}} be rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E

5|$|In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the {{situation}} already {{left in the}} wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it was stronger than the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> sparse population {{in the area of}} landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4million and roughly 332,000 people were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|Outer space, also simply called space, refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> empty {{regions of}} the {{universe}} outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at {{what is known as}} the heliopause.|$|E

5|$|Plans from {{a number}} of European {{aircraft}} manufacturers called for a successor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> successful BAC One-Eleven, and to replace the 737–200 and DC-9. Germany's MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm), British Aircraft Corporation, Sweden's Saab and Spain's CASA worked on the EUROPLANE, a 180- to 200-seat aircraft. It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications. VFW-Fokker, Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150-seat designs.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} factors contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> rapid {{fall of the}} fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E
5|$|The Capture of Savannah, or {{sometimes}} the First Battle of Savannah (because of a siege in 1779), was an American Revolutionary War battle fought on December 29, 1778 pitting local American Patriot militia and Continental Army units, holding the city, against a British invasion force {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell. The British seizure of the city led to an extended occupation and was the opening move in the British southern strategy to regain control of the rebellious Southern provinces by appealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> strong Loyalist sentiment there.|$|E

5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, in stark contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} isotope is astatine-210, {{which has a}} {{half-life}} of 8.1hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter polonium-210. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long-lived bismuth-209.|$|E

5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E
5|$|When Pearson bent {{the frame}} of his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working as a house roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which {{included}} two sons. Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson was unsure if he should join the team, and Fox was not convinced that he should trust his car <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E
5|$|After Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate in 1981, Mathias sought the {{chairmanship}} of the Judiciary Committee but was relegated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> mundane chairmanship of the Rules Committee. He was also appointed chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and the District of Columbia, and accepted a seat on the influential Foreign Relations Committee, though he had to sacrifice his seat on the Appropriations Committee to do so. In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} Joint Committee on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E
