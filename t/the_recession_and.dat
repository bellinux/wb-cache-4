The Ferrari F40 had been selling for more than £800,000 in 1990, but like the XJ220 it was adversely affected by <b>the</b> <b>recession,</b> <b>and</b> by 1992 prices had dropped to between £100,000 to £150,000.|$|E

A further £20million is earmarked for a refurbishment of the nearby Altrincham Interchange. A 2010 survey found that despite being in one of the country's most affluent areas, {{nearly a third of the}} shops in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) to the effects of <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> plans to refurbish Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.|$|E

5|$|He {{missed the}} entire 1991–92 season while he recovered, {{suffering}} a further knee injury in late 1991, when an incident at a nightclub on Tyneside {{kept him out}} for even longer. The saga over Gascoigne's proposed transfer to Lazio dominated the tabloid press throughout 1991, often overshadowing the key national news of that time – namely <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> rise in unemployment that it sparked – although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about Gascoigne confined to their back pages.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the Anacostia Station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail {{ridership}} showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, WMATA {{said that it would}} run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were due to <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E
5|$|He scored {{just two}} more {{goals in the}} league in the final three months of the season, in a 1–1 draw with Arsenal and a 2–1 victory over Liverpool, but scored in both the quarter-final of the FA Cup against Leicester City and a 3–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final as Cardiff reached their first FA Cup final. He was part of the side {{selected}} to play in the 1925 FA Cup Final, losing 1–0 to Sheffield United following a goal from Fred Tunstall. Despite his goal drought, during his time at the club Beadles won two caps for Wales, playing in consecutive matches on 14 and 28 February 1925 against Scotland and England in the 1924–25 British Home Championship. The following year, Beadles scored in the opening game of the 1925–26 season during a 3–2 defeat to Manchester City and scored 3 times in 5 further appearances in the opening months of the season. However, despite this form, Beadles was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in order to raise money due to <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> the arrival of Joe Cassidy from Bolton Wanderers.|$|E

25|$|The Roosevelt Administration {{was under}} assault during Roosevelt's second term, which {{presided over a}} new dip in the Great Depression {{in the fall of}} 1937 that {{continued}} until most of 1938. Production and profits declined sharply. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938. The downturn was perhaps due to nothing more than the familiar rhythms of the business cycle. But until 1937 Roosevelt had claimed responsibility for the excellent economic performance. That backfired in <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> the heated political atmosphere of 1937.|$|E
25|$|In May 1992, {{entertainment}} magazine The Hollywood Reporter {{reported that}} about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce – approximately 3,000 people – had resigned {{from their jobs}} because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> increased unemployment, which was affecting France {{and most of the}} rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.|$|E
25|$|Business-oriented {{observers}} explained <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> {{recovery in}} very different terms from the Keynesian economists. They argued the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935–37. They said it had encouraged massive strikes which had {{a negative impact on}} major industries and had threatened anti-trust attacks on big corporations. But all those threats diminished sharply after 1938. For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The CIO and AFL unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.|$|E

25|$|The early 1980s {{also saw}} a {{significant}} decline in league attendances {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> the ongoing problem of hooliganism. This did no favours for the financial position and league standing of numerous clubs, and several – including Wolverhampton Wanderers, Swansea City and Middlesbrough – were almost forced out of business as a result. The fortunes of the First Division clubs suffered a fresh blow in 1985 when all English clubs were banned from European competitions {{as a result of the}} Heysel disaster, where rioting involving Liverpool fans at the European Cup final in Belgium resulted in 39 spectator deaths.|$|E

25|$|In March 2009, the Bank of England cut {{interest}} rates to a historic low of 0.5% and began quantitative easing to boost lending and shore up the economy. The UK exited the Great Recession in Q4 of 2009 having experienced six consecutive quarters of negative growth, shrinking by 6.03% from peak to trough, making it the longest recession since records began and the deepest recession since World WarII. Support for Labour slumped during <b>the</b> <b>recession,</b> <b>and</b> the general election of 2010 resulted in a coalition government being formed by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, which made deep spending cuts in order to ease the budget deficit.|$|E
30|$|Specifically, the {{structural}} test asks whether <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> initiated {{a pattern of}} labor market transitions {{different from the one}} that existed previously.

The expansionary and contractionary business cycle movement in the two sub-sample periods is helpful in providing useful variation to estimate hiring and firing patterns prior to <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> <b>and</b> how those patterns varied with the start of <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession.</b>|$|R
