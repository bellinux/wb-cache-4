5|$|In 1993, NSB test-ran an X2 {{train on}} the Randsfjord Line, and between 29 September and 21 December 1996, ran a unit in regular {{service on the}} Sørland Line. On 23 February 1995, NSB signed a {{contract}} to purchase 16 Class 71 trains for use on the Airport Express Train on the Gardermoen Line. The contract included two options, one for 16 trains for intercity traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic. The reason for using {{the same type of}} train as the Airport Express Train, was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet. The options would only modify the trains slightly; they were primarily designed for the airport service and any optimization for intercity and <b>tilting</b> <b>technology</b> was secondary in the design process. The first option was taken out on 5 March 1997.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, Quale {{stated that}} the inspectorate should never have {{approved}} the trains. He {{stated that the}} Sørland Line was extreme in Europe {{in the number of}} curves, and that this gave increased stress on the axles. The tests which were used to approve the trains had been done on the Dovre Line and with a Class 71 set equipped with <b>tilting</b> <b>technology,</b> a class which weighs less than Class 73. He further stated that NSB had controlled only part of the axle and that if proper tests had been made, the fatigue would have been discovered. NSB stated that they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line. There was also a misunderstanding in the approval, as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line, while the inspectorate had the impression that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line. NSB stated that all tests would be done again before the trains were put back into service.|$|E
25|$|The West German federal {{railways}} DB {{experimented with}} <b>tilting</b> <b>technology</b> in the 1970s, but abandoned it. Then in 1987, DB commissioned {{a study on}} whether electrification or purchasing diesel tilting trains would be the better option for the Nuremberg-Hof line, and decided for the latter. In 1988, DB ordered 10 tilting DMUs, and another 10 in 1990. All 20 trains of the new DB Class 610 were delivered in 1992. The two-car trains with {{a top speed of}} 160km/h were produced by a consortium of five German companies and Fiat Ferroviaria. Fiat supplied the bogies, the hydraulic tilting suspension, and the other parts of the <b>tilting</b> <b>technology,</b> thus the trains could be called Pendolino (a Fiat trademarked brand name).|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, British Rail {{had planned to}} address the WCML {{limitations}} with the Advanced Passenger Train project; this circumvented any requirement to make significant infrastructure changes by using <b>tilting</b> train <b>technology.</b> The project reached the prototype stage, {{with the introduction of}} three Class 370 electric multiple units into passenger service in 1981. However, initial failures of the <b>tilt</b> <b>technology</b> led to them being withdrawn. They were then used from 1984 to 1986 as test trains for researching the technologies and specifications required for what would become the Class 91.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 testing {{started on}} the West Coast Main Line of the Advanced Passenger Train (APT), formed of two Class 370 units {{composed}} of a driving trailer, five trailers and a power car. To increase speed the car bodies tilted, but problems meant the trains were withdrawn. The <b>tilt</b> <b>technology</b> was used twenty years later in Class 390 Pendolinos on the same route.|$|R
5000|$|Fleischmann {{offers a}} model track with full profile rails, [...] "Thinking" [...] turnouts, a turntable, {{and even a}} [...] "Rack & Pinion" [...] railway. Its more recent lineup {{includes}} the PROFI label, which consists of the pre-ballasted track, PROFI couplings for true close coupling operation, and even the <b>tilt</b> <b>technology</b> found in both the Pendolino and the ICE-T express train.|$|R
25|$|Regional Australian {{passenger}} services are arguably quite slow (for example, the approximately 960km journey from Sydney to Melbourne takes about 11 hours, {{an average of}} about 83km/h). However, several medium-speed rail services operate on existing track that has been upgraded to accommodate faster services and/or <b>tilting</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ÖBB in Austria {{also uses}} two ICE T {{trainsets}} (classified as ÖBB Class 4011) between Wien Westbahnhof, Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof and Bregenz (without stops in Germany), {{although they do}} not use <b>tilting</b> <b>technology.</b> Since December 2007 ÖBB and DB offer a bi-hourly connection between Wien Westbf and Frankfurt Hbf.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Alstom {{sold its}} diesel engine {{businesses}} (Ruston, Paxman, and Mirrlees Blackstone) to MAN Group. It also acquired a 51% stake in Fiat Ferroviaria, the Italian rail manufacturer and {{world leader in}} <b>tilting</b> <b>technology.</b> In April 2003, Alstom sold its industrial turbine business to Siemens for €1.1billion.|$|E
5000|$|From 2000 to 2005 Virgin Trains modernised the West Coast Main Line with Alstom's Class 390 125 mph capable 9-car units. These use the <b>tilt</b> <b>technology</b> {{developed}} {{twenty years}} previously by the APT project. These units {{were designed for}} speeds of 140 mph, however speeds over 125 mph require in-cab signalling and {{this has not been}} installed. [...] some units are being lengthened to 11 cars, doubling the standard class seats.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{there is}} an hourly service on the Saarbrücken-Mainz route, run as the Rhine-Nahe-Express (RE3) Regional-Express service. Every second train runs to and from Frankfurt and stops at the Frankfurt Airport Regional station. Until 2014, tilting systems of class 612 were operated, but since the change of {{operators}} in December 2014, vlexx has operated LINT 54 and 81 diesel multiple units without <b>tilt</b> <b>technology,</b> although the journey times on the line have only increased slightly.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>tilting</b> <b>technologies</b> {{currently}} being used or developed in the railway industry. The Italian pendolino developed by FIAT [5] stands out as {{the most popular and}} is being used today in the United Kingdom West Coast mainline. The Swedish X 2000 train series developed by ASEA Brown Boveri [5]. Other developed or currently being developed technologies include the long air spring system developed in Japan [6] and the hybrid system also developed in Japan [7].|$|R
25|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} ICE 3, Siemens {{developed}} trains with <b>tilting</b> <b>technology,</b> using {{much of the}} ICE 3 technical design. The class 411 (seven cars) and 415 (five cars) ICE T EMUs and class 605 ICE TD DMUs (four cars) were built with a similar interior and exterior design. They were specially designed for older railway lines not suitable for high speeds, for example the twisting lines in Thuringia. ICE-TD has diesel traction. ICE-T and ICE-TD can be operated jointly, {{but this is not}} done routinely.|$|E
25|$|Deutsche Bahn ordered more {{regional}} and express tilting DMUs with other technology (class 611 and class 612: Adtranz/Bombardier, ICE TD/class 605: Siemens). However, for the 230km/h electric ICE T trains ordered in 1994 for service on conventional lines, Pendolino technology was chosen again. Fiat (Alstom) supplied the bogies and <b>tilting</b> <b>technology</b> for the 32 7-car class 411 and 11 5-car class 415 express trains that entered service from 1999. In 2002, DB placed another order for slightly modified class 411 trains, Alstom Ferroviaria was again supplier of bogies and tilt technology when the 28 trains were delivered from 2004 to 2006.|$|E
500|$|Proposals {{had been}} made for NSB to {{purchase}} the same units as the Swedish State Railways (SJ), the X2, in a Nordic cooperation {{to use the same}} trains in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, but the idea was abandoned. In 1994, NSB launched plans to build [...] of high-speed railways by 2011, but also these plans were shelved. In May 1995, Osmund Ueland was hired as director-general of NSB, and he scrapped all plans to build new railways, and instead decided to focus on <b>tilting</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1955 to 1990 {{he was an}} {{engineer}} at Bell Helicopter, {{and worked as a}} leading engineer with Bob Lichten from 1964 on the <b>tilt</b> rotor <b>technology.</b>|$|R
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the ETR 470 Pendolino, the class {{designation}} N was introduced. [...] Thanks to their <b>tilt</b> <b>technology,</b> these multiple unit trains have an even higher cornering speed compared with designation R (e.g. , instead of [...] ). [...] The Swiss Federal Railways Tilt Train RABDe 500 (InterCityNeigezug) also achieves this norm, but the train itself was given the designation R. [...] Technically, locomotives of the class R can also operate to the standards of class N, but in practice the maximum cornering speeds are lower, to improve passenger comfort by reducing lateral forces.|$|R
5000|$|During testing [...] in 2009 it {{was found}} that the new ETR 610 trains were too heavy for the main Gotthard route from Zurich to Milan for which they had been ordered. The weight of the train {{influences}} the permitted cornering speed due to forces on the track - the heavier the train the slower the cornering speed allowed. It was found the new trains would have to run so slowly that traditional trains without <b>tilting</b> <b>technologies</b> would be just as fast, thus calling the whole project into question.|$|R
500|$|The unit {{is based}} on the Swedish X2 {{designed}} by Kalmar Verkstad in the 1980s, and delivered from 1990 to the Swedish State Railways for use in their X 2000 high-speed intercity trains. Although the technology involved is similar, like spot-welded stainless steel car bodies, the Class 71 differs in several ways. First, the unit does not have a separate locomotive unit, but has the motors spread throughout the train, with one powered and one unpowered bogie in each car. The car bodies are totally different in layout, including the doors between bogies instead of {{at the end of the}} cars. In addition, the trains are pressure tight to increase comfort for passengers while passing through tunnels. They also have hydraulic couplers at the ends, which are hidden behind covers when not used. The Class 71 is also shorter, with only three cars, and does not have any <b>tilting</b> <b>technology</b> installed. The exterior design, especially the nose, is quite different. Norges Statsbaner later took order of 22 units of the Class 73, that is almost identical, but has four cars and <b>tilting</b> <b>technology.</b> Class 73's pantograph is pivoted in order to keep it centred under the [...] catenary when the body tilts.|$|E
500|$|The {{differences}} between Class 71 and 73 {{is that the}} latter has a different interior, four instead of three cars, different door design, the removal of one set of doors per car {{and the addition of}} tilting. [...] At the time of ordering, it was announced that the trains would enter service on the Sørland Line during the summer of 1999, the Dovre Line during the fall of 1999, and the Bergen Line during the fall of 2000. Class 71 was delivered in 1997 and 1998; one of the units was delivered with <b>tilting</b> <b>technology</b> to test it out—and subsequently removed. The first batch of trains cost NOK1.6 billion.|$|E
500|$|In 1990 and 1994, NSB {{published}} {{two reports}} regarding {{the future of}} intercity rail transport in Norway. The reports concluded that {{there would have to}} be invested 56 billion Norwegian krone (NOK) in new infrastructure if the main corridors were to be built as high-speed railways. Instead, the use of <b>tilting</b> <b>technology</b> was proposed to allow higher speeds on existing lines. In 1992, the Parliament of Norway voted to build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and connect it to the capital with the high-speed Gardermoen Line. It was decided that the service should take 19 minutes—and not one minute more. When issuing invitations to tenders, NSB specified this time limit as a criterion, which was also the reason the line was dimensioned for [...]|$|E

500|$|When the {{new airport}} opened on 8 October 1998, and the Flytoget airport express train service started {{operations}} with sixteen Type 71 multiple units. Trains {{had to use the}} old Hoved Line from Oslo S to Lillestrøm, but could use the new high-speed line from Lillestrøm to Gardermoen. Regular operations using Romeriksporten started on 22 August 1999. To {{be able to use the}} new Gardermoen Line infrastructure, Norges Statsbaner had to buy new trains capable of higher speeds.

2500|$|An {{attempt was}} made in the 1970s and 1980s to {{introduce}} a high-speed train that could operate on Britain's winding infrastructure – British Rail developed the Advanced Passenger Train using active <b>tilting</b> <b>technology.</b> After four prototypes had been built and tested, the project was closed down when Margaret Thatcher and British Railways management lost confidence in the technology.
