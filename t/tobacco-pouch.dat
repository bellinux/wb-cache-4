60|$|The subdued {{sounds of}} rousing {{broke into a}} loud buzz of active preparation, as the men busied {{themselves}} in bundling up blankets, carrying down camp-kettles to the lake, launching the boats, kicking up lazy comrades, stumbling over and swearing at fallen trees which were not visible in the cold, uncertain light of the early dawn, searching hopelessly, among a tangled conglomeration of leaves and broken branches and crushed herbage, for lost pipes and missing <b>tobacco-pouches.</b>|$|R
6000|$|AT length {{the slow}} [...] "month of blessings" [...] passed away. We rejoiced like Romans {{finishing}} their Quaresima, when a salvo of artillery from the citadel announced {{the end of}} our Lenten woes. On the last day of Ramazan all gave alms to the poor, at the rate of a piastre and a half for each member of the household-slave, servant, and master. The next day, first of the three composing the Bayram or Id[FN#1] (the Lesser Festival), we arose before dawn, performed our ablutions, and repaired to the Mosque, to recite the peculiar prayer of the season, and to hear the sermon which bade us be [...] "merry and wise." [...] After which we ate and drank heartily; then, with pipes and <b>tobacco-pouches</b> in hand, we sauntered out to enjoy the contemplation of smiling faces and street scenery.|$|R
6000|$|But it {{was destined}} to be resumed long before that hour, and in {{circumstances}} which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his spring to the door. I had stood for some minutes looking at the silent figure in the bed. His face was almost covered by the clothes and he appeared to be asleep. Then, unable to settle down to reading, I walked slowly round the room, examining the pictures of celebrated criminals with which every wall was adorned. Finally, in my aimless perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. A litter of pipes, <b>tobacco-pouches,</b> syringes, penknives, revolver-cartridges, and other debris was scattered over it. In the midst of these was a small black and white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a neat little thing, and I had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely, when---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} is all this mystery about?" [...] he cried boldly. [...] "Ever since you pulled out that feather-fan and <b>tobacco-pouch</b> at Blyth's--" ...|$|E
6000|$|This double remark {{was made}} to King Bumble, who passed the <b>tobacco-pouch</b> to his friend, after helping himself, and {{admitted}} that it was [...] "mugnifercent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay; a {{polar bear}} and her cub settled the {{question}} for us, as you shall hear presently," [...] replied Frank. [...] "But first hand me papa's <b>tobacco-pouch,</b> please, as my pipe is exhausted.|$|E
60|$|A {{long pause}} followed, during which Mrs. Ross knitted stolidly on, only nodding {{permission}} when Clara's young man, mate {{on one of}} the Shire Line sailing ships, came to walk out with her. I studied the half-dozen ostrich eggs, hanging in the corner against the wall like a cluster of some monstrous fruit. On each shell were painted precipitous and impossible seas through which full-rigged ships foamed with a lack of perspective only equalled by their sharp technical perfection. On the mantelpiece stood two large pearl shells, obviously a pair, intricately carved by the patient hands of New Caledonian convicts. In the centre of the mantel was a stuffed bird-of-paradise, while about the room were scattered gorgeous shells from the southern seas, delicate sprays of coral sprouting from barnacled pi-pi shells and cased in glass, assegais from South Africa, stone axes from New Guinea, huge Alaskan <b>tobacco-pouches</b> beaded with heraldic totem designs, a boomerang from Australia, divers ships in glass bottles, a cannibal kai-kai bowl from the Marquesas, and fragile cabinets from China and the Indies and inlaid with mother-of-pearl and precious woods.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.244] to Al-Madinah, her adopted country, after a {{visit to}} a sister at Cairo, allowed herself the luxury of a half-dollar Shibriyah or cot, {{fastened}} crosswise over the animal's load. Moreover, all the party, except Omar Effendi, in token of poverty, were dressed in the coarsest and dirtiest of clothes,-the general suit consisting of a shirt torn in divers places and a bit of rag wrapped round the head. They carried short chibuks without mouth-pieces, and <b>tobacco-pouches</b> of greasy leather. Though the country hereabouts is perfectly safe, all had their arms in readiness, and the unusual silence that succeeded to the singing, even Sa'ad the Demon held his tongue,-was sufficient to show how much they feared for their property. After a slow march of two hours facing the moon, we turned somewhat towards the North-East, and began to pass over undulating ground, in which a steady rise was perceptible. We arrived at the halting-place at three in the morning, after a short march of about eight hours, during which we could not have passed over more than sixteen miles.[FN#2] The camels were nakh'd[FN#3]; the boxes were taken off and piled together as a precaution against invisible robbers; my little tent, {{the only one in the}} party, was pitched; we then spread our rugs upon the ground and lay down to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|The rest of {{the evening}} they spent in {{wandering}} through the village, charmed with its bizarre mixture of quaintness and commonplaceness; in hanging about the shop-Windows with their monotonous variety of feather fans,--each with a violently red or yellow bird painfully sacrificed in its centre,--moccasins, bead-wrought work-bags, <b>tobacco-pouches,</b> bows and arrows, and whatever else the savage art of the neighboring squaws can invent; in sauntering through these gay booths, pricing many things, and in hanging long and undecidedly over cases full of feldspar crosses, quartz bracelets and necklaces, and every manner of vase, inoperative pitcher, and other vessel that can be fashioned out of the geological formations at Niagara, tormented meantime by the heat of the gas-lights and the persistence of the mosquitoes. There were very few people besides themselves in the shops, and Isabel's purchases were not lavish. Her husband had made up his mind to get her some little keepsake; and when he had taken her to the hotel he ran back to one of the shops, and hastily bought her a feather fan,--a magnificent thing of deep magenta dye shading into blue, with a whole yellow-bird transfixed in the centre. When he triumphantly displayed it in their room, [...] "Who's that for, Basil?" [...] demanded his wife; [...] "the cook?" [...] But seeing his ghastly look at this, she fell upon his neck, crying, [...] "O you poor old tasteless darling! You've got it for me!" [...] and seemed about to die of laughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I heers dat," [...] replied Ali carelessly, as {{he filled}} his pipe from Flaggan's <b>tobacco-pouch.</b> [...] "I sees all de hids as I comes up de road dis marnin'. Twinty more mule hims 'xpec' for come in de morrer mornin'." ...|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, when supper was over, and {{the pair}} were {{seated in the}} sitting-room before the fire, this episode was forgotten. Mrs. Rylands {{produced}} her husband's pipe and <b>tobacco-pouch.</b> He looked around the formal walls and hesitated. He {{had been in the}} habit of smoking in the kitchen.|$|E
6000|$|He smiled graciously, {{and opened}} his <b>tobacco-pouch.</b> He was fresh and strong after his night's sleep--healthy and {{handsome}} and good-humored. The house-maids had had a peep at him that morning, and had wished--like Desdemona, with a difference--that [...] "Heaven had made {{all three of them}} such a man." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{finds the}} strangest kinds of seeds, {{some of them}} bright-coloured like lollipops, or really like {{precious}} stones; {{some of them in}} odd cases like <b>tobacco-pouches.</b> He finds and collects all kinds of little shells, with which the whole ground is scattered, and that, though they are the shells of land creatures like our snails, are of nearly as many shapes and colours as the shells on our sea-beaches. In the streams that come running down out of our mountains, all as clear and bright as mirror-glass, he sees eels and little bright fish that sometimes jump together out of the surface of the brook in a spray of silver, and fresh-water prawns which lie close under the stones, looking up at him through the water with eyes the colour of a jewel. He sees all kinds of beautiful birds, some of them blue and white, and some of them coloured like our pigeons at home; and these last, the little girls in the cellar may like to know, live almost entirely on wild nutmegs as they fall ripe off the trees. Another little bird he may sometimes see, as the lean man saw him only this morning: a little fellow not so big as a man's hand, exquisitely neat, of a pretty bronzy black like ladies' shoes, who sticks up behind him (much as a peacock does) his little tail, shaped and fluted like a scallop-shell.|$|R
60|$|The {{industrial}} implements were coarse {{needles and}} fish-hooks of sheep-bone. The domestic supellex consisted of wooden ladles coarsely cut, and of rude pottery, red and yellow, generally without handles, round-shaped and adorned with scratches. None of these ganigos, or crocks, were painted {{like those of}} Grand Canary. They used also small basaltic querns of two pieces to grind the gofio, [Footnote: The gofio was composed of ripe barley, toasted, pounded, and kneaded {{to a kind of}} porridge in leathern bags like Turkish <b>tobacco-pouches.</b> The object was to save the teeth, of which the Guanches were particularly careful.] or parched grain. The articles of dress were grass-cloth, thick as matting, and tamarcos, or smock-frocks, of poorly tanned goatskins. They had also rough cords of palm-fibre, and they seem to have preferred plaiting to weaving; yet New Zealand flax and aloes grow abundantly. Their mahones correspond with Indian moccasins, and they made sugar-loaf caps of skins. The bases of shells, ground down to the thickness of a crown-piece, and showing spiral depressions, were probably the viongwa, necklaces still worn in the Lake Regions of Central Africa. The beads were of many kinds; some horn cylinders bulging in the centre, and measuring 1.25 inch long; others of flattened clay like the American wampum or the ornaments of the Fernando Po tribes; and others flattened discs, also baked, almost identical with those found upon African mummies--in Peru they were used to record dates and events. A few were of reddish agate, a material not found in the island; these resembled bits of thick pipe-stem, varying from half an inch to an inch in length. Perhaps they were copies of the mysterious Popo-bead found upon the Slave Coast and in inner Africa.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the aunt}} and niece played cards very {{amicably}} together, and drank to each other's health, and each took a {{wing of the}} chicken, and pulled a bone of the merry-thought, and (in conversation) scratched their neighbours', not each other's, eyes out. Thus we have read how the Peninsular warriors, when the bugles sang truce, fraternised and exchanged <b>tobacco-pouches</b> and wine, ready to seize their firelocks and knock each other's heads off when the truce was over; and thus our old soldiers, skilful in war, but knowing the charms of a quiet life, laid their weapons down for the nonce, and hob-and-nobbed gaily together. Of course, whilst drinking with Jack Frenchman, you have your piece handy to blow his brains out if he makes a hostile move: but, meanwhile, it is A votre sante, mon camarade! Here's to you, mounseer! and everything is as pleasant as possible. Regarding Aunt Bernstein's threatened gout? The twinges had gone off. Maria was so glad! Maria's fainting fits? She had no return of them. A slight recurrence last night. The Baroness was so sorry! Her niece must see the best doctor, take everything to fortify her, continue to take the steel, even after she left Tunbridge. How kind of Aunt Bernstein to offer to send some of the bottled waters after her! Suppose Madame Bernstein says in confidence to her own woman, [...] "Fainting fits!--pooh!--epilepsy! inherited from that horrible scrofulous German mother!" [...] What means have we of knowing the private conversation of the old lady and her attendant? Suppose Lady Maria orders Mrs. Betty, her ladyship's maid, to taste every glass of medicinal water, first declaring that her aunt is capable of poisoning her? Very likely such conversations take place. These are but precautions--these are the firelocks which our old soldiers have at their sides, loaded and cocked, but at present lying quiet on the grass.|$|R
6000|$|He {{put back}} his <b>tobacco-pouch</b> in his pocket. His {{handsome}} face was {{as hard as}} stone. His clear blue eyes defied all the girls in England put together to see into his mind. [...] "Have you done, Miss Lundie?" [...] he asked, suddenly changing to a bantering politeness of tone and manner.|$|E
60|$|Another {{interval}} {{followed in}} which neither spoke. Jeff was slowly pursuing {{his line of}} thought. After Joe's last remark he returned his pipe to his pocket and brought out a <b>tobacco-pouch.</b> He tore off {{a large portion of}} the weed and thrust it into his mouth. Then he held out the little buckskin sack to Joe.|$|E
60|$|Under {{the active}} {{patronage}} of Mrs. Mac-Candlish, Sampson {{picked up some}} other scholars--very different indeed from Charles Hazlewood in rank, and whose lessons were proportionally unproductive. Still, however, he gained something, {{and it was the}} glory of his heart to carry it to Mr. Mac-Morlan weekly, a slight peculium only subtracted to supply his snuff-box and <b>tobacco-pouch.</b>|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MISS BOODLE,--The {{lean man}} is {{exceedingly}} ashamed of himself, and offers his apologies {{to the little}} girls in the cellar just above. If they will be so good as to knock three times upon the floor, he will hear it {{on the other side}} of his floor, and will understand that he is forgiven. I believe I got you and the children--or rather left you and the children--still on the road to the lean man's house. When you get up there a great part of the forest has been cleared away. It comes back again pretty quick, though not quite so high; but everywhere, except where the weeders have been kept busy, young trees have sprouted up, and the cattle and the horses cannot be seen as they feed. In this clearing there are two or three houses scattered about, and between the two biggest I think the little girls in the cellar would first notice a sort of thing like a gridiron on legs made of logs and wood. Sometimes it has a flag flying on it made of rags of old clothes. It is a fort (so I am told) built by the person here who would be much the most interesting to the girls in the cellar. This is a young gentleman of eleven years of age answering to the name of Austin. It was after reading a book about the Red Indians that he thought it more prudent to create this place of strength. As the Red Indians are in North America, and this fort seems to me a very useless kind of building, I am anxious to hope that the two may never be brought together. When Austin is not engaged in building forts, nor on his lessons, which are just as annoying to him as other children's lessons are to them, he walks sometimes in the bush, and if anybody is with him, talks all the time. When he is alone I don't think he says anything, and I dare say he feels very lonely and frightened, just as the lean man does, at the queer noises and the endless lines of the trees. He finds the strangest kinds of seeds, some of them bright coloured like lollipops, or really like precious stones; some of them in odd cases like <b>tobacco-pouches.</b> He finds and collects all kinds of little shells with which the whole ground is scattered, and which, though they are the shells of land animals like our snails, are nearly of as many shapes and colours as the shells on our sea-beaches. In the streams that come running down out of the mountains, and which are all as clear and bright as mirror glass, he sees eels and little bright fish that sometimes jump together out of the surface of the brook in a little knot of silver, and fresh-water prawns which lie close under the stones, and can be seen looking up at him with eyes of the colour of a jewel. He sees all kinds of beautiful birds, some of them blue and white, some of them blue and white and red, and some of them coloured like our pigeons at home, and these last the little girls in the cellar may like to know live almost entirely on nutmegs as they fall ripe off the trees. Another little bird he may sometimes see, as the lean man saw him only this morning, a little fellow not so big as a man's hand, exquisitely neat, of a pretty bronze black like ladies' shoes, and who sticks up behind him (much as a peacock does) his little tail shaped and fluted like a scallop shell.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} I reached home {{my sister had}} been {{pronounced}} out of danger. Of course I was much relieved to hear it, {{but at the same}} time this was a lesson to me not to act rashly. The retention of my <b>tobacco-pouch</b> would not have retarded her recovery, and I could not help picturing my pouch, my oldest friend in the world, lying at the foot of that fence. I saw that I had done wrong in casting it from me. I had not even the consolation of feeling that if any one found it he would cherish it, for it was so much damaged that I knew it could never appeal to a new owner as it appealed to me. I had intended telling my sister of the sacrifice made for her sake; but after seeing her so much better, I left the room without doing so. There was Arcadia Mixture in the house, but I had not the heart to smoke. I went early to bed, and fell into a troubled sleep, from which I awoke with a shiver. The rain was driving against my window, tapping noisily on it as if calling on me to awake and go back for my <b>tobacco-pouch.</b> It rained far on into the morning, and I lay miserably, seeing nothing before me but a wet fence, and a <b>tobacco-pouch</b> among the grass at the foot of it.|$|E
60|$|As he went on, Elsie {{stared at}} the picture fixedly, and it changed under her glance till his deeply passionate words seemed written on the canvas. The {{painting}} {{ceased to be a}} human face and became a mechanical setting together of features, a clever delineation of the exterior of a ragged old man holding a beaded <b>tobacco-pouch</b> and a long red pipe.|$|E
60|$|It used {{to belong}} to old man Clark, young Joe Clark's uncle, said the ancient, smacking his lips delicately over the ale and {{extending}} a tremulous claw to the <b>tobacco-pouch</b> pushed towards him; and he was never tired of showing it off to people. He {{used to call it}} 'is blue-eyed darling, and the fuss 'e made o' that cat was sinful.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, La Roche, whose {{activity}} had {{enabled him}} to carry over his portion of the cargo long before his comrades, came to the pool which Frank had just left, and seating himself on a large stone, drew forth his <b>tobacco-pouch.</b> With a comical leer at the water which had so recently been deprived of its denizens, he proceeded leisurely to fill a pipe.|$|E
60|$|SCENE.--Thymy grass-plot at back of t!'e Mahasu dak-bungalow, {{overlooking}} little wooded valley. On the left, {{glimpse of}} the Dead Forest of Fagoo; on the right, Simla Hills. In background, line of the Snows. CAPTAIN GADSBY, now three weeks a husband, is smoking the pipe of peace on a rug in the sunshine. Banjo and <b>tobacco-pouch</b> on rug. Overhead the Fagoo eagles. MRS. G. comes out of bungalow.|$|E
60|$|The {{dress of}} these people is {{generally}} half civilized, half savage. They wear a capot or surcoat, made of a blanket, a striped cotton shirt, cloth trousers, or leathern leggins, moccasins of deer-skin, and a belt of variegated worsted, from which are suspended the knife, <b>tobacco-pouch,</b> and other implements. Their language is of the same piebald character, being a French patois, embroidered with Indian and English words and phrases.|$|E

60|$|The Count and {{his wife}} joined us at that moment. The lady had her husband's {{embroidered}} <b>tobacco-pouch,</b> and her store of paper in her hand, for the manufacture of the eternal cigarettes. The gentleman, dressed, as usual, in his blouse and straw hat, carried the gay little pagoda-cage, with his darling white mice in it, and smiled on them, and on us, with a bland amiability which {{it was impossible to}} resist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marion {{can tell}} you," [...] he said. He motioned towards the coffee-pot and asked, [...] "More?" [...] I shook my head, and he said, [...] "Come out {{and let us}} see what the {{maritime}} interests have been doing for us. Pipe or cigar?" [...] I chose cigarettes, and he brought the box off the table, stopping {{on his way to}} the veranda, and taking his pipe and <b>tobacco-pouch</b> from the hall mantel.|$|E
60|$|Anson {{studied his}} {{right-hand}} {{man for a}} moment, then, taking out his <b>tobacco-pouch,</b> he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely to roll a cigarette. He put it between his thin lips and apparently forgot to light it. For a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and some scant sage-brush. Riggs took to pacing up and down. Wilson leaned as before against the cedar. The girl slowly recovered from her excess of anger.|$|E
60|$|For want of {{anything}} better, {{he handed the}} astonished driver his <b>tobacco-pouch,</b> and waved him to the house. The lad descended from his perch {{and ran to the}} door just as Dick Tipping, giving vent to a sharp cry, was rushing out. The cry acted on the skipper like magic, and, snatching up the whip, he gave the horse a cut in which was concentrated the fears of the last fortnight and the hopes of his future lifetime.|$|E
60|$|Elsa put {{her hand}} through the hole, too, to see {{the extent of the}} mischief. Yes! that was it, her father must more than once have missed the pocket and put his hand into the hole, making it bigger and bigger. Why! there was a whole lot of rubbish deep down inside the lining. Elsa drew out an empty <b>tobacco-pouch,</b> a bit of string, a length of tinder, and from the very bottom, where it lay in a crinkled mass, a ball of {{crumpled}} paper.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} he reached {{in his pocket}} for his <b>tobacco-pouch,</b> to console himself with smoke. To his dismay he found it was not there. He had had it in the train, but now it had vanished. This added to his gloom, for the pouch {{had been given to}} him by Margaret, and he had always thought it one more proof of the way her nature towered over the natures of other girls that she had not woven a {{monogram}} on it in forget-me-nots. This record pouch was missing, and Archibald mourned for the loss.|$|E
60|$|Duane {{looked around}} {{him for a}} book or paper, {{anything}} to read; but all the printed matter he could find consisted of a few words on cartridge-boxes and an advertisement {{on the back of}} a <b>tobacco-pouch.</b> There seemed to be nothing for him to do. He had rested; he did not want to lie down any more. He began to walk to and fro, from one end of the room to the other. And as he walked he fell into the lately acquired habit of brooding over his misfortune.|$|E
