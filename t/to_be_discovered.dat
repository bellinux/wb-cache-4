5|$|The {{first few}} amino acids were {{discovered}} in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine, the first amino acid <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered.</b> Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.|$|E

5|$|An {{enormous}} {{variety of}} genomic structures {{can be seen}} among viral species; as a group, they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria. There are millions of different types of viruses, although only about 5,000 types have been described in detail. As of September 2015, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 75,000 complete genome sequences. but there are doubtlessly many more <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cerium was {{the first}} of the {{lanthanides}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered,</b> in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. It was first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1839. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters. Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties.|$|E

5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 {{would later be}} {{recognized}} as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered,</b> {{and they would be}} deemed island universes. However, the word Universe was later understood to mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known as galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{was first}} {{excavated}} from Antarctica's Early Jurassic, Sinemurian to Pliensbachian aged Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, by paleontologist Dr. William Hammer in 1991. It {{was the first}} carnivorous dinosaur <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered</b> in Antarctica and the first non-avian dinosaur from the continent to be officially named. The sediments in which its fossils were found have been dated at ~194 to 188 million years ago, representing the Early Jurassic Period.|$|E

5|$|Enceladus {{is named}} after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name, like the names {{of each of the}} first seven {{satellites}} of Saturn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered,</b> was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not {{visible to the naked}} eye, and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and {{is found in}} many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, {{though it was not}} identified until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered.</b> Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} {{elements were}} still {{missing from the}} periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|E
