The English, after losing Tourelles, fall back to the coast to await for reinforcements. Word comes that the Burgundian troops are coming to help the English. Joan meets with the Duke of Burgundy to warn him against a battle before she returns to her men to help bury the dead. Talbot's son comes with reinforcements from England, and the English army attacks the French at Patay. During the battle, Joan is able to kill the son and Conrade is able to kill the father. This causes the English to flee and, in turn, allows the French to retake Rheims. Once Rheims is free, Charles comes and is crowned the King of France. The story ends with Joan telling him to be a good king.|$|E

Of particular interest in this novel is the greed of Sir Oliver in taking Castelgard and La Roque, and Arnaut’s greed in wanting to take it back. This causes Marek and his team to be stuck in the middle of two battling hotheads.|$|E
25|$|On 21 November, the CGT {{called for}} the strikes to stop as the {{government}} has allegedly agreed to negotiate. An opinion poll published in the Figaro estimates 2/3 of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>are</b> against the strike, and the Ministry of Economy declared that the strike was costing the French economy €400 million a day and SNCF €100 million a day. According to the SNCF, the operator of the national train lines 23% of their staff were still on strike, while the RATP operating the Paris Métro, and some suburban trains claimed 16% of their staff were on strike. However the service on the Parisian trains and Métro was still below 25% {{because most of the}} strikers were train drivers.|$|E
25|$|The Armée de l'Air {{became one}} of the first {{professional}} air forces in the world when it was founded in 1909. The French took active interest in developing their air force and had the first fighter pilots of World War I. During the interwar years, however, particularly in the 1930s, the technical quality fell when compared with the Luftwaffe, which crushed both the French and British air forces during the Battle of France. In the post–World War II era, the French made a concerted and successful effort to develop a homegrown aircraft industry. Dassault Aviation led the way forward with their unique and effective delta-wing designs, which formed the basis for the famous Mirage series of jet fighters. The Mirage repeatedly demonstrated its deadly abilities in the Six-Day War and the Gulf War, becoming one of the most popular and well-sold aircraft in the history of military aviation along the way. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>are</b> awaiting the A400M military transport aircraft, which is still in developmental stages, and the integration of the new Rafale multi-role jet fighter, whose first squadron of 20 aircraft became operational in 2006 at Saint-Dizier.|$|E

Although anti-French feelings in Vietnam have abated, the use of words like thực dân (colonist) to describe <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>is</b> still common.

500|$|Catherine de' Medici's {{investment}} in magnificent entertainments {{was part of}} a conscious political programme. She recalled the belief of her father-in-law, King Francis I, that the court needed to be physically active and constantly entertained.• Catherine wrote to Charles IX: [...] "I heard it said to your grandfather the King that two things were necessary to live in peace with the French and have them love their King: keep them happy, and busy at some exercise, notably tournaments; for <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>are</b> accustomed, if there is no war, to exercise themselves and if they are not made to do so they employ themselves to more dangerous [...] ". Quoted in Jollet, 111. She also declared her intention to imitate the Roman emperors, who kept their subjects from mischief by occupying them with games and amusements. She therefore adopted a policy of distracting her nobles from fighting among themselves by laying on irresistible entertainments and sports for them at court.|$|E

500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests {{they should have}} done, Thompson instead ordered one of the British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among the many things taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, but the fact is, that <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>are</b> good at plunder").|$|E
500|$|Shelley's {{political}} {{frame for}} her travel narrative {{was a difficult}} one to sell to readers. Her audience wanted to support the revolutionaries, especially exiles living among them, such as Mazzini, {{but they were also}} fearful of the violence of the Carbonari and its nationalist ideology. They connected nationalism to their historic enemy—Napoleonic France. In fact, other travel works published at the time made the argument that Napoleon was responsible for Italian unification. Shelley therefore contends that the Risorgimento is primarily inspired by the English and only secondarily by the French (she never names Napoleon). Shelley writes a history of Italian nationalism acceptable to English readers, in which <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>are</b> the tyrants oppressing the rising nation of Italy, which the Carbonari, although violent, has inspired and created. Her readers could therefore comfortably support Italian nationalism without supporting policies reminiscent of Napoleon. She also placed most of her political commentary {{at the end of the}} text. As Moskal explains, [...] "Shelley creates a structure in which the reader, having already befriended the traveller for some pages, receives this political matter from a friend, not from a stranger." [...] She also praises Italian literature, particularly the works of Alessandro Manzoni, Pietro Colletta, and Michele Amari, connecting it to Italian nationalism.|$|E
500|$|The journal, which {{switches}} {{between the}} first-person singular and plural but never identifies its narrators, describes Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week tour across the Continent. It is divided by country: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the group arrives in Calais {{and proceeds to}} Paris, they decide on a plan: [...] "After talking over and rejecting many plans, we fixed on one eccentric enough, but which, from its romance, was very pleasing to us. In England {{we could not have}} put it in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence: <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>are</b> far more tolerant of the vagaries of their neighbours. We resolved to walk through France". Each day they enter a new town; but even while travelling, they spend time writing and reading. The journal comments on the people they meet, the countryside, and the current events that have shaped the environment. Some of what they see is beautiful and some is [...] "barren and wretched". Percy sprains his ankle, which becomes an increasing problem—the group is forced to hire a carriage. By the time the trio reaches Lucerne, they are nearly out of money and decide to return home. They return by boat along the Rhine, the cheapest mode of travel. Despite problems with unreliable boats and dangerous waters, they see some beautiful scenery before landing in England.|$|E
