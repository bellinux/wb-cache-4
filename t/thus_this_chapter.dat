Topics such as Nātya, Nritya, Nritta, Rasa, Bhava, Vibhava, Anubhāva, Satwikabhāva, Vyabhicharibhāva, their enacting, movements of eyes for different Rasas and Bhavas etc. are also discussed here [...] Some examples of Rasābhinaya (Rasa-Abhinaya) are also given. <b>Thus</b> <b>this</b> <b>chapter</b> gives a clear picture of the theory and practice regarding Rasābhinaya. The minute details of Netrābhinaya- enacting with eyes, eyes only are given here by the greatest master of Netrābhinaya.|$|E

However, entrepreneurship scholars have largely overlooked the impact of household and family on entrepreneurs' abilities to access resources and pursue opportunities. <b>Thus,</b> <b>this</b> <b>chapter</b> draws on prior geographical research to inform its analysis, as extant studies in human and cultural geography explore the relationship between households and home as spaces of (social) production and consumption...|$|E

In the early stage, most efforts were put on using multilayer neural networks or recurrent networks for a sophisticated nonlinear dependence of the current observation on past values and noise disturbances, as outlined in Fig.  1 by Box 3.

40|$|Abstract. Dependable {{systems have}} to be {{developed}} carefully to prevent loss of life and resources due to system failures. Some of their mechanisms (for example, providing fault-tolerance) can be complicated to design and use correctly in the system context and are <b>thus</b> error-prone. <b>This</b> <b>chapter</b> gives an overview of reliability-related analyses {{for the design of}} component-based software systems. This enables the identification of failure-prone components using complexity metrics and the operational profile, and the checking of reliability requirements using stereotypes. We report on the implementation of checks in a tool inside a framework for tool-supported development of reliable systems with UML and two case studies to validate the metrics and checks. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Embryomorphic Engineering, a {{particular}} instance of Morphogenetic Engineering, takes its inspiration directly from biological development {{to create new}} robotic, software or network architectures by decentralized self-assembly of elementary agents. At its core, it combines three key principles of multicellular embryogenesis: chemical gradient diffusion (providing positional information to the agents), gene regulatory networks (triggering their differentiation into types, thus patterning), and cell division or aggregation (creating structural constraints, <b>thus</b> reshaping). <b>This</b> <b>chapter</b> illustrates the potential of Embryomorphic Engineering in different spaces: 2 D/ 3 D physical swarms, which can find applications in collective robotics, synthetic biology or nanotechnology; and nD graph topologies, which can find applications in distributed software and peer-to-peer techno-social networks. In all cases, the specific genotype shared by all the agents makes the phenotype’s complex architecture and function modular, programmable and reproducible. <b>This</b> <b>chapter</b> is a condensed review version of references [16 – 22]. ...|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, {{we examine}} {{watershed}} policymaking from an explicitly moral point of view. Our {{intention is to}} provide a normative outlook on the descriptive framework presented in Chapter 1, to allow for a moral evaluation of collaborative watershed management. Because watersheds typically are public resources under the jurisdiction of governmental agencies, this evaluation enlists the values that justify our political system at large. <b>Thus</b> <b>this</b> <b>chapter</b> invokes the idea of political legitimacy: the condition whereby a government’s use of power is morally right. Our subject, therefore, is how public participation in watershed policymaking contributes to political legitimacy...|$|E

Cognitive criticism and neuroscience research provide evidence that deep, nuanced reading of literary texts can be transformative. Prerequisite to this transformation to be enacted in school classrooms, are the literary experiences of pre-service teachers. <b>Thus,</b> <b>this</b> <b>chapter</b> outlines detailed readings of selected texts on a developmental continuum from early picture books through to sophisticated and ambiguous young adult fiction, as models for such literary encounters in initial teacher education course...|$|E

It is however not a totalizing argument, perhaps not even an entirely consistent one and it is certainly a partial one.

These mobile solutions, whether smartphones or other sensor devices, promised to empower consumers to be better able to monitor their own health and wellbeing and thereby be better placed to engage in more meaningful and in-depth discussions with their respective clinicians. It is clear that such mobile solutions are only in their infancy in health care, and the whole area of mobile health (mHealth) care is growing exponentially.

40|$|The chapter {{discusses}} {{and examines}} the educational potential of computer games in language learning. The commercial success of games has recently attracted the scholarly study from various fields.

Some prominent learning theories in relation to computer aided language learning are detailed. This is followed by a discussion of what computer games are before some case studies of game-based language learning are presented. Some implications on the language uses of computer games are derived and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Domesticities, as {{reflected}} in contemporary cultural geography and defined in this chapter, are the processes and sites through which people create senses of belonging, safety, security, and comfort. Contemporary cultural geographers' engagement with domesticity both draws upon and exceeds these popular and historical definitions. <b>Thus,</b> <b>this</b> <b>chapter</b> begins with key theoretical currents in cultural geographers' understanding of domesticities, tracing {{the ways in which}} engagement with feminist, material culture, and postcolonial perspectives currently defines the term. It then considers domesticities through two lenses: domesticities in the house-as-home and domesticities beyond the house. Separately, these lenses encompass key geographical ideas; together, they encapsulate the spectrum of contemporary scholarship on domesticities. 14 page(s...|$|E

The advantages of culturing embryos in a full complement of amino acids, at close to physiological concentrations will be considered. Moreover, the noninvasive measurement of amino acid turnover by individual embryos, a method which holds great promise to assess developmental competency prior to transfer, will also be discussed. <b>Thus,</b> <b>this</b> <b>chapter</b> highlights the fundamental role of amino acids for the metabolic and homeostatic regulation of the preimplantation embry...|$|E

Dealing with small, discrete numbers; experiencing economic booms and busts; spawning companies which wield significant leverage {{by virtue of being}} modestly large; not to mention the structuring difficulties of operating viable manufacturing activities... all these are issues which are not unique to Malta but are faced by other small island jurisdictions, since they are economic consequences of smallness and insularity. <b>Thus,</b> in <b>this</b> <b>chapter,</b> the analysis of the Malta situation will proceed from the perspective and vantage point of ‘comparative island studies’ (for example, Biagini and Hoyle, 1999; Baldacchino, 2004); drawing on recent fieldwork on the challenges facing small businesses from a number of different European island regions. The chapter argues that the successful internationalization of locally owned firms benefits handsomely from a thorough, qualitative analysis of successfully internationalized firms, scrutinized from a comparative perspective.
