5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. <b>The</b> <b>commission</b> was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation.

5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. <b>The</b> <b>commission</b> was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with <b>the</b> <b>commission.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E

Alves fought back, denouncing Neto for not aligning Angola with the Soviet Union. After twelve hours of debate, the party voted 26 to 6 to dismiss Alves and Van-Dunem from their positions.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1919, <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> {{had spent}} £7,500, and this figure rose to £250,000 in 1920 as {{construction}} of cemeteries and memorials increased.

5|$|By early May, the Albanian authorities, {{being unable}} to {{suppress}} the revolt, became willing to start discussions with {{the intervention of the}} International Commission.

5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism.

Against Hale's wishes, <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> called for the abolition of benefit of clergy, and the acquittal of those charged with justified homicide. <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> also suggested that debtors should no longer be imprisoned, and attorneys should be educated at an Inn of Court and not allowed to practise until they were admitted as members.|$|E

50|$|Building Enclosure Commissioning (BECx) (sometimes 'envelope' is {{used instead}} of 'enclosure') is a strict quality-focused process wherein the energy {{performance}} of a facility, system or assembly is evaluated and verified against defined objectives and criteria. The process itself is carried out by a commissioning team which uses reliable and accurate measures to verify that the project is meeting specific quality requirements outlined by the owner of <b>the</b> project. <b>The</b> <b>commissioning</b> process begins at project inception and runs through different construction phases, which include a pre-design phase, pre-construction phase and construction phase. Once the construction is finished, <b>the</b> <b>commissioning</b> process continues and becomes an ongoing routine {{in the life of}} the facility. Specific information regarding <b>the</b> <b>commissioning</b> process is outlined in the ASHRAE Guideline 0-2005: <b>The</b> <b>Commissioning</b> Process.
