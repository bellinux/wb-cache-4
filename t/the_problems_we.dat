[...] As one Central Committee member put it, [...] "Now nothing more can happen. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> face now are trifles compared {{to those in the}} past." [...] Lê Duẩn promised the Vietnamese people in 1976 that each family would own a radio set, refrigerator and TV within ten years; he seemed to believe he could easily integrate the South Vietnamese consumer society with agrarian North Vietnam. In 1976 the 4th National Congress declared Vietnam would complete its socialist transformation within twenty years. This optimism proved unfounded; instead Vietnam staggered from one economic crisis to another.|$|E

Speaking of the errors and overall attitude surrounding the Apollo program before the accident, he stated: [...] "We were too 'gung-ho' about the schedule and we blocked out all of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we." [...] He reminded the team of the perils and mercilessness of their endeavor, and stated the new requirement that every member of every team in mission control be [...] "tough and competent", requiring nothing less than perfection throughout NASA's programs. In 2003, following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe quoted Kranz's speech, applying it to the Columbia crew.|$|E

[...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now."

De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who hold}} this {{interpretation}} {{argue that this}} aspect of Ozu's work gives it its universality, and helps it transcend the specifically Japanese cultural {{context in which the}} films were created. Bock writes: [...] "The subject matter of the Ozu film is what faces all of us born of man and woman and going on to produce offspring of our own: the family… [...] may be applied to Ozu’s works and create an illusion of peculiar Japaneseness, but in fact behind the words are <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> all face in a life cycle. They are the struggles of self-definition, of individual freedom, of disappointed expectations, of the impossibility of communication, of separation and loss brought about by the inevitable passages of marriage and death." [...] Bock suggests that Ozu’s wish to portray the life cycle affected his decisions on technical matters, such as the construction and use of the sets of his films. [...] "In employing the set like a curtainless stage Ozu allows for implication of transitoriness in the human condition. Allied with the other aspects of ritual in Ozu's techniques, it reinforces the feeling that we are watching a representative life cycle." ...|$|E
