The {{first official}} European translation appeared in Serbia and Montenegro in Serbian, by the official publisher Narodna Knjiga, in early September 2003. Other translations appeared later (e.g. in November 2003 in Dutch and German). The English-language version has topped the best-seller list in France, while in Germany and the Netherlands an unofficial distributed <b>translation</b> <b>process</b> has been started on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|During the North American {{localization}} of Pokémon, a small {{team led}} by Hiro Nakamura went through the individual Pokémon, renaming them for western audiences based on their appearance and characteristics after approval from Nintendo Co. Ltd. In addition, during this process, Nintendo trademarked the 151 Pokémon names {{in order to ensure}} they would be unique to the franchise. During the <b>translation</b> <b>process,</b> it became apparent that simply altering the games' text from Japanese to English was impossible; the games had to be entirely reprogrammed from scratch due to the fragile state of their source code, a side effect of the unusually lengthy development time. Therefore, the games were based on the more modern Japanese version of Blue; modeling its programming and artwork, but keeping the same distribution of Pokémon found in the Japanese Red and Green cartridges, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 2011, {{freelance}} translator Nazerine released a fan translation patch {{of the free}} demo version of the game. The initial project involved Nazerine translating, writing, and revising the game text, while another person hacked the game so that the translated text displayed properly on the game screen. This English patch launched {{the first wave of}} western interest in the game, with several video game publications reporting on it due to the game's unusual concept. The success of this translation attracted the attention of Hato Moa herself, who then offered Nazerine the opportunity to translate the full game—and later its sequel, Holiday Star—for an official English release. The <b>translation</b> <b>process</b> of the full game was also a solo effort by Nazerine; however, Hato removed the need for hacking by directly supervising the translation, adjusting images in the game for English sentences. As the demo's English patch was made before Nazerine had access to the full version of the game, several lines of dialogue were translated differently to reflect context revealed in Bad Boys Love; for example, third-person pronouns from Kazuaki Nanaki's route implying that he had a female lover in the fan translation were replaced with gender-neutral ones in the official translation. Few dramatic changes were made, though several jokes were added in Nazerine's translations of the game that were not present in the original Japanese text. The official English version of the game was released for download on 15 February 2012. The 2014 remake has also been confirmed to have used Nazerine's translation.|$|E
40|$|A {{class of}} {{stationary}} non-Gaussian processes, {{referred to as}} the class of mixtures of <b>translation</b> <b>processes,</b> is defined by their finite dimensional distributions consisting of mixtures of finite dimensional distributions of <b>translation</b> <b>processes.</b> The class of mixtures of <b>translation</b> <b>processes</b> includes <b>translation</b> <b>processes</b> and is useful for both Monte Carlo simulation and analytical studies. As for <b>translation</b> <b>processes,</b> the mixture of <b>translation</b> <b>processes</b> can have a wide range of marginal distributions and correlation functions. Moreover, these processes can match a broader range of second order correlation functions than <b>translation</b> <b>processes.</b> The paper also develops an algorithm for generating samples of any non-Gaussian process in the class of mixtures of <b>translation</b> <b>processes.</b> The algorithm is based on the sampling representation theorem for stochastic processes and properties of the conditional distributions.

25|$|Even {{though the}} ribosomes are usually {{considered}} accurate and processive machines, the <b>translation</b> <b>process</b> {{is subject to}} errors that can lead either to the synthesis of erroneous proteins or to the premature abandonment of translation. The rate of error in synthesizing proteins has been estimated to be between 1/105 and 1/103 misincorporated amino acids, depending on the experimental conditions. The rate of premature translation abandonment, instead, has been estimated {{to be of the}} order of magnitude of 10−4 events per translated codon.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} the text and {{conversation}} exchange is reciprocal: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, needs to have a beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using punctuation, bracketing or framing. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs. Taylor submits this process is a <b>translation</b> <b>process</b> of: translation of text to conversation and the translation of conversation into text.|$|E

25|$|Especially in fansubs, the {{subtitle}} translator may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle translator may also choose {{to display a}} note in {{the subtitle}}s, usually in parentheses (“” and “”), or as a separate block of on-screen text—this allows the subtitle translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle translator may leave {{a note on the}} screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see Japanese pronouns) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English <b>translation</b> <b>process,</b> the subtitle translator may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.|$|E
25|$|In prokaryotes {{translation}} generally {{occurs at}} the point of transcription (co-transcriptionally), often using a messenger RNA that is {{still in the process of}} being created. In eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be. Major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane. Proteins that are supposed to be expressed at the endoplasmic reticulum are recognised part-way through the <b>translation</b> <b>process.</b> This is governed by the signal recognition particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a signal peptide on the growing (nascent) amino acid chain.|$|E
25|$|The work of {{translating}} {{was typically}} undertaken in this fashion: A member, or members, {{of one of}} the committees would produce a draft of a book, or books, of the Bible (typically from the section in which they were assigned) and submit the draft to the section committee. Occasionally a scholar outside the committee would be invited to participate in this phase of the <b>translation</b> <b>process</b> and was asked to submit a draft of the book or books with which he or she had renowned experience. This draft was then distributed among the members of the appropriate committee. Members of the committee would then meet and discuss the translation choices made in the draft. The draft that resulted from this meeting of the concerned committee was then sent to the committee of literary advisers, who would revise the draft in co-operation with the translators. When a consensus on the draft was reached, the final draft would be sent on to the Joint Committee, which was head over the four sub-committees.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of the Internet environments, more and more language services become accessible for common people. However, the gap between human translators and machine translators remains huge especially for the domain of localization processes that requires high translation quality. Although efforts of combining human and machine translators for supporting multilingual communication have been reported in previous research, how to apply such approaches for improving localization processes are rarely discussed. In this paper, we aim at improving localization processes by composing human and machine translation services based on the Language Grid, which is a language service platform that we have developed. Further, we conduct experiments to compare the translation quality and translation cost using several <b>translation</b> <b>processes,</b> including absolute machine <b>translation</b> <b>processes,</b> absolute human <b>translation</b> <b>processes</b> and <b>translation</b> <b>processes</b> by human and machine translation services. The experiment results show that composing monolingual roles and dictionary services improves the translation quality of machine translators, and that collaboration of human and machine translators is possible to reduce the cost comparing with the absolute bilingual human translation. We also discuss the generality of the experimental results and further challenging issues of the proposed localization processes. 1...|$|R

25|$|The {{quicksort}} algorithm {{was developed}} in 1959 by Tony Hoare while in the Soviet Union, as a visiting student at Moscow State University. At that time, Hoare worked in a project on machine translation for the National Physical Laboratory. As {{a part of the}} <b>translation</b> <b>process,</b> he needed to sort the words of Russian sentences prior to looking them up in a Russian-English dictionary that was already sorted in alphabetic order on magnetic tape. After recognizing that his first idea, insertion sort, would be slow, he quickly came up with a new idea that was Quicksort. He wrote a program in Mercury Autocode for the partition but couldn't write the program to account for the list of unsorted segments. On return to England, he was asked to write code for Shellsort as part of his new job. Hoare mentioned to his boss that he knew of a faster algorithm and his boss bet sixpence that he didn't. His boss ultimately accepted that he had lost the bet. Later, Hoare learned about ALGOL and its ability to do recursion that enabled him to publish the code in Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, the premier computer science journal of the time.|$|E

This study sought ten experts’ views {{on the role of}} transfer and <b>translation</b> <b>processes</b> in biology learning. Qualitative analysis of the responses revealed six expert themes surrounding the potential challenges that learners face, and the required cognitive abilities for transfer and <b>translation</b> <b>processes.</b> Consultation with relevant curriculum documents identified four types of biological knowledge that students are required to develop at the secondary level. The expert themes and the knowledge types exposed were used to determine how pupils might acquire and apply these four types of biological knowledge during learning.
