5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on <b>their</b> <b>blood,</b> while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|Greco-Roman mythology {{described}} the Empusae, the Lamia, and the striges. Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking <b>their</b> <b>blood.</b> The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking <b>their</b> <b>blood,</b> as did the gelloudes or Gello. Like the Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.|$|E

5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> pressure stable, phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E

5|$|When the ducklings {{were ready}} for slaughter, the duckers would {{generally}} kill them on their own premises.

To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been plucked. The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.|$|E

5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project.

The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in <b>their</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed.

5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in <b>their</b> <b>blood.</b> Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E
