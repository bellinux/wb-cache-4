5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Douglas {{argues that}} Jardine liked {{to make his}} runs when his side was in {{difficulty}} and enjoyed being tested; his approach would often lead his team <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held {{his place in the}} England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> of digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E

5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
5|$|For {{southern}} sea otters to {{be considered}} for removal from threatened species listing, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that the population should exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. In response <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> efforts, the population climbed steadily from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s, then remained relatively flat from 2005–2014 at just under 3,000. There was some contraction from the northern (now Pigeon Point) and southern limits of the sea otter's range during the end of this period, circumstantially related to an increase in lethal shark bites, raising concerns that the population had reached a plateau. However, the population increased markedly from 2015–2016, with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) California sea otter survey 3-year average reaching 3,272 in 2016, the first time it exceeded the threshold for delisting from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Assuming the population maintains positive trends, ESA delisting is inevitable, although southern sea otters would still be fully protected by state regulations and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which sets a higher threshold for protection, subjectively at about 8,400 individuals.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, President Gerald Ford {{approved}} the declaration for Florida, and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm's flooding rains progressed northward. Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline assigned 600 National Guardsmen {{to assist in}} the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas. Over $430 million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk of the funds went <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course. In Maryland, Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state's 23 counties under a state of emergency. Following the severe damage caused by Hurricane Eloise, its name was retired {{at the end of the}} 1975 season. As such, the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the Atlantic hurricane basin. However, Eloise was not replaced by any particular name due to the addition of male names into the lists in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> of the Akutan Zero, {{technical}} information from three other downed Zeros {{was available to}} the Allies. One Zero (serial number 5349), piloted by Hajime Toyoshima, crashed on Melville Island in Australia following the bombing of Darwin. The Zero was heavily damaged, and Toyoshima became Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the Pacific war. Another Zero, piloted by Yoshimitsu Maeda, crashed near Cape Rodney, New Guinea. The team sent to recover the plane erred when they chopped off the wings, severing the wing spars and rendering the hulk unflyable. The third came from China, where Gerhard Neumann was able to reconstruct a working Zero. He used a partly intact Zero (serial number 3372) that had landed in Chinese territory, repaired with salvaged pieces from other downed Zeros. However, bad conditions and the long delivery time from China prevented Neumann's Zero from reaching the United States for testing until after {{the recovery of the}} Akutan Zero.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{announced}} a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded {{that it would have been}} impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> vehicles was unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|The western jackdaw {{is found}} from north-west Africa {{through all of}} Europe, except for the extreme north, and eastwards through central Asia to the eastern Himalayas and Lake Baikal. To the east, it occurs {{throughout}} Turkey, the Caucasus, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and north-west India. However, it is regionally extinct in Malta and Tunisia. The range is vast, with an estimated global extent of between 1 million and 10 million square kilometres (4 hundred thousand to 4 million square miles). It has a large global population, with an estimated 15.6 to 45 million individuals in Europe alone. Censuses of bird populations in marginal uplands in Britain show that western jackdaws greatly increased in numbers between the 1970s and 2010, although this increase may be related <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> from previous periods when they were regarded as pests. The UK population was estimated at 2.5 million individuals in 1998, up from 780,000 in 1970.|$|E
50|$|Free will is {{fundamental}} <b>to</b> <b>Recovery's</b> method. The subconscious, {{as it is}} known in psychoanalysis, as well as viewpoints emphasizing unconscious motivations, drives, and instincts are considered <b>to</b> be self-defeating. <b>Recovery</b> considers adults as capable of behaving based on deliberate plans, settled decisions, reasoned conclusions and firm determinations. Will gives adults the ability to accept or reject thoughts and impulses. Recovery members achieve mental health by training their Wills to reject self-defeating thoughts and impulses, countering them with self-endorsing thoughts and wellness-promoting actions.|$|R
