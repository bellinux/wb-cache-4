25|$|The yellow New York City taxi {{has become}} iconic {{in its use}} {{in the arts and}} media. Some artists have used the taxis as a medium for their artwork. In 2011 artist Amir Baradaran {{conducted}} Transient an art instillation using the taxis’ passenger compartment TV screens to broadcast a 40-second video of the driver’s eyes as they reflect from <b>the</b> <b>rearview</b> mirror. The video was meant to confront the rider with a presence that is typically ignored and to create a moment of introspection.|$|E
500|$|Following its release, [...] "Sun of a Gun" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. When Leahey reviewed the parent album, he stated the single [...] "stand {{out from the}} rest of the pack". Robert Copsey for Digital Spy found it a [...] "delicate yet cinematic slice of synth-pop". Andrew Hannah from The Line of Best Fit complimented McCracken's ability [...] "to produce a killer chorus", in addition to [...] "the ability to tell a story, and lift the music away from the dreary conventionality of a song about relationships". A critic from Sunset in <b>the</b> <b>Rearview</b> called the single a [...] "pop winner", while DeShaun Zollicoffer of GeekRevolt labelled it a [...] "stand out track". Additionally, a reviewer from Mixtape Muse found [...] "Sun of a Gun" [...] and album track [...] "Voodoo" [...] good for dancing. On the other hand, in his album review, John Calvert of Drowned in Sound disapproved of the track, stating [...] " [...] is as dated as the album gets, sounding like something Rachel Stevens would've recorded while grinning inanely at a lame kitten".|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} positive; Sal Cinquemani form Slant Magazine {{suggested}} that [...] "The Fear" [...] is {{proof of the}} pop singer's self-awareness, but, given her own personal tabloid history, the song possesses a trail of irony: [...] "I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror/I'm on the right track, yeah, we're onto a winner." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly liked the song, in which Allen makes fun of her own material-girl ID {{and went on to}} say that it is in fact [...] "a tale of two Lilys: the naughty postadolescent in <b>the</b> <b>rearview</b> mirror, and the fully realized female coming around the bend." [...] Chris Buckle from The Skinny gave [...] "The Fear" [...] three stars, commenting that it [...] "is a potent reminder that she's more than just gobby gossip-fodder", but also disliked a few lyrics, which [...] "in particular [...] a clumsy attempt to inject politics amongst the celeb-woe naval-gazing", while About.com praised the song for being a [...] "pop masterpiece", Allen's [...] "witty intelligent lyrics" [...] and compared it to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls".|$|E
500|$|The band {{illustrated}} the theme {{on the cover}} of Double Nickels on the Dime, which depicts Watt driving his Volkswagen Beetle at exactly 55 miles per hour ("double nickels" [...] in trucker slang) traveling southbound through downtown Los Angeles on Route 110, also known as the Harbor Freeway, toward the band's hometown of San Pedro, California. [...] "The title means fifty-five miles per hour on the button, like we were Johnny Conservative." [...] Dirk Vandenberg, the band's [...] "buddy/contributor," [...] took photos from the backseat as Watt drove under the sign to San Pedro; it took three circuits of the highway and two days of photography before Minutemen were happy with the cover. Vandenberg later commented on the cover art: [...] "There were three elements that Mike [...] wanted in the photo: a natural kind of glint in his eyes reflected in <b>the</b> <b>rearview</b> mirror, the speedometer pinned exactly at 55mph, and, of course, the San Pedro sign guiding us home". However, when the cover was presented to SST, [...] "someone botched the cropping for the print and cut off the end of the word Pedro." ...|$|E

40|$|An {{automatic}} parking system provides convenience for drivers by automatically finding free parking spaces and steering automobiles toward them. This paper proposes a vision-based free parking space detection system. The proposed method {{consists of two}} stages. First, <b>the</b> automobile <b>rearview</b> is three-dimensionally reconstructed using the optical flow-based method. The metric information is recovered using the scale ratio between the camera heights {{in the real world}} and the reconstructed world. Second, the free parking space is detected by estimating the parking space orientation and the reference point in the top-view of the reconstructed 3 D structure. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully reconstructs the 3 D structures of <b>the</b> automobile <b>rearview</b> and detects free parking spaces in the different environments. ...|$|R

50|$|The Leitra was {{approved}} by the Danish authorities for general use after systematic tests in 1982. Approval was given on the condition that the cyclist must be able to give unhindered arm signals for turning and stopping.

The design of <b>the</b> built-in <b>rearview</b> mirror on top of the fairing was also approved by the Danish authorities.|$|R

50|$|The top was cabriolet-style {{with a full}} inner {{headliner}} {{hiding the}} folding mechanism and crossbars. In between the two top layers was 1 in of insulation. The rear window was tempered safety glass, and after 1968, heated. Due to {{the thickness of the}} top, it remained quite tall when folded. To enable the driver to see over the lowered top, <b>the</b> inside <b>rearview</b> was mounted on an offset pivot. By twisting the mirror 180 degrees on a longitudinal axis, the mirror glass would raise approximately 2 in.|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamics {{of trucks}} and other high sided {{vehicles}} is of significant interest in reducing road side accidents due to wind loading and in improving fuel economy. Recognizing {{the limitations of}} conventional wind tunnel testing, considerable efforts have been invested {{in the last decade}} to study vehicle aerodynamics computationally. In this paper, a three-dimensional near field flow analysis has been performed for axial and cross wind loading to understand the airflow characteristics surrounding a trucklike bluff body. Results provide associated drag for the truck geometry including <b>the</b> exterior <b>rearview</b> mirror. Modifying truck geometry can reduce drag, improving fuel economy...|$|R

50|$|As noted above, the MP3 audio player feature (really usable for any {{device with}} a 3.5 mm {{headphone}} jack) {{was added to}} all trim levels. An integrated rearview camera {{was added to the}} top two trim levels. An integrated rearview camera could be added to the non-navigation Base model as a dealer installed option. The Base model optional rearview camera was installed in the same manner and position as on the 2006 models, mounted dead center in the trunk trim, with the trunk release button displaced to the right of center (passenger side). The difference was subtle, but <b>the</b> factory <b>rearview</b> camera installation on the Technology Package and the Technology Package with CMBS/PAX is to the left side (driver's side) of the center-mounted trunk release.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} automobile {{to incorporate}} a backup camera was the 1991 Toyota Soarer Limited (UZZ31 and UZZ32), {{which was only}} available in Japan and not on its U.S. counterpart, the Lexus SC. The Toyota system used a colour EMV screen, with a rear-spoiler-mounted CCD camera. The system was discontinued in 1997. In April 2000, Nissan's Infiniti luxury division introduced <b>the</b> <b>RearView</b> Monitor on the 2002 Q45 flagship sedan at the 2000 New York International Auto Show. Introducing coloured onscreen guide lines as a parking distance parameter, <b>the</b> <b>RearView</b> Monitor operated from a license-plate-mounted camera in the trunk that transmitted a mirrored image to an in-dash (7-inch) LCD screen.

50|$|The ART is {{equipped}} with various sensors to assist the driver in following the route on a virtual track, or to make detours {{in the case of}} traffic jams. A Lane Departure Warning System helps to keep the vehicle in its lane and automatically warns, if it drifts away from the lane. A Collision Warning System supports the driver on keeping a safe distance with other vehicles on the road and if the proximity reduces below a given level, it alerts the driver by a warning sign. The Route Change Authorization is navigation device, which analyzes the traffic conditions on the chosen route and can recommend a detour to avoid traffic congestion. <b>The</b> Electronic <b>Rearview</b> Mirrors work with remotely adjustable cameras and provide a clearer view than conventional mirrors including an auto dimming device to reduce the glare.|$|R
