25|$|Meanwhile, the Portuguese took {{advantage}} of the Catalan revolt to declare their own independence in 1640. The 60 years of union between Portugal and Spain were not happy. The Portuguese fluent Philip II visited the country twice, but Philip III only once, in a short formal visit, and Philip IV never bothered to. The Spanish, hard pressed elsewhere, were blamed for inadequately protecting Portugal's overseas colonies from the Dutch (who annexed part of Brazil), and in a time of economic downturn, the Spanish colonies did not enjoy having to trade and compete with their Portuguese counterparts. Moreover, Portugal's autonomous status as an equal in the union went into decline after Philip II and was treated increasingly in the great councils of state as a province. After Portugal declared independence and chose the Duke of Braganza as King John IV, Spain was distracted with a Revolt in Andalusia and thus chose <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> anything about it.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the capture}} of Pretoria, the Scots Greys were sent to {{liberate}} British prisoners. The POW's being held at Waterval POW camp, the same one where those captured in the Jameson Raid had been held. As the Scots Greys approached, prisoner lookouts at the camp spotted the dragoons when they moved through Onderstepoort. As word spread through the camp, the British prisoners over-powered the guards, mostly men either too old or {{too young to be}} out on commando, pushed their way out of confinement to meet with the Scots Greys. Although the camp guards were easily overcome, and most likely unknown to the British forces and prisoners, Koos de la Rey and his men were positioned to try and prevent the rescue of the British prisoners. De la Rey ordered warning shells fired, trying to keep the prisoners in their prison camp. Faced with the approaching Scots Greys and the prisoners, De la Rey opted <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> more and instead ordered a retreat rather than fight a battle over the prison camp.|$|E

At the premiere, Destination: Atlantis was on display, featuring behind-the-scenes props {{from the film}} and information on the legend of Atlantis with video games, displays, laser tag, and other attractions. The Aquarium of the Pacific also loaned a variety of fish for display within the attraction. With a budget of $100 million, the film opened at #2 on its debut weekend, behind Lara Croft: Tomb Raider earning $20.3 million in 3,011 theaters. The film's international release began September 20 in Australia and other markets followed suit. During its 25-week theatrical run, Atlantis: The Lost Empire grossed over $186 million worldwide ($84 million from the United States and Canada). Responding to its disappointing box-office performance, Thomas Schumacher, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, said, [...] "It {{seemed like a good}} idea at the time <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> a sweet fairy tale, but we missed." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, in the United States, it was commercially unsuccessful, not entering any of the US Billboard charts, making it Stefani's first song as a solo artist <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so. Internationally, it reached the top-twenty in a few European countries, having its higher chart position in Norway, where it debuted and peaked at number seventeen. However, it became her lowest-charting single there. In Austria, it became her second lowest-charting single, peaking at number sixty, with [...] "Luxurious" [...] being her lowest at number sixty-six. In the United Kingdom, it reached number fifty-nine, becoming Stefani's third UK release not to reach the top-twenty of the UK Singles Chart. In Australasia, the single performed very moderately. It debuted at number 39 on the ARIA Charts and reaching its peak position, number 37, the following week. It remained for five weeks on the charts, but was her lowest-peaking solo single. On the other hand, in New Zealand, [...] "Now That You Got It" [...] spent eight weeks on the charts, debuting at number 36, on October 1, 2007, and peaking at number 21, on October 8, 2007.

500|$|Mileena {{appeared}} in the 1999 episode [...] "Shadow of a Doubt" [...] of the television series , {{in which she had}} no direct relation to Kitana and was here depicted as an initially very repulsive and aggressive Outworld warrior sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the weakened Kung Lao, with a magic spell placed over her to give her Kitana's look (for a while, he even called her his [...] "new daughter"). Mileena, wearing a green costume, succeeded in seducing Kung Lao, but could not bring herself to kill him during their night of passion and was also explicitly warned by Shang Tsung <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it. She makes excuses for Kahn and later fights an inconclusive duel against Kitana, broken by Shao Kahn. As punishment for her taking too much time in her mission, Kahn allows Mileena to keep her beauty with the exception of making her teeth exaggeratedly pointed. She then starts to wear her signature mask, which Kahn gives her before banishing her from his sight. In Konquest, Mileena was portrayed by Meg Brown and Audie England played Mileena pretending to be Kitana. Brown said she liked her sexy Mileena costume so much that she asked to be let [...] "wear the outfit home for her boyfriend." ...|$|E

2500|$|First, {{the meaning}} of a [...] "trade dispute" [...] under TULRCA 1992 section 244 is {{confined}} to mean a dispute [...] "between workers and their employer" [...] and must mainly relate to employment terms. In BBC v Hearn Lord Denning MR granted an injunction against a strike by BBC staff to stop broadcast of the 1977 FA Cup Final to apartheid South Africa. He reasoned that this was a political dispute, not a [...] "trade dispute", unless the union was requesting [...] "putting a clause in the contract" [...] <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> such work. Strikes against government legislation (rather than an employer), or privatisation, or outsourcing before it happens, have been held unlawful. However, at the least, any dispute over the terms or conditions on which workers do their jobs will allow protection. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 224 prevents collective action against someone who is [...] "not the employer party to the dispute". So called [...] "secondary action" [...] was lawful from the Trade Union Act 1871 until 1927, and again from 1946 till 1980. This makes the definition of [...] "employer" [...] relevant, particularly where a trade dispute involves a company group. A worker's written statement of the contract may purport to say that the only [...] "employer" [...] is a subsidiary, although the parent company carries out the employer's function of ultimately setting the contractual terms and conditions. There are a limited number of outright prohibitions on strike action, but in accordance with ILO Convention 87 this is only for workplaces that involve the truly essential functions of the state (for armed forces, police, and prison officers), and only when impartial arbitration is used as an alternative.|$|E

60|$|It was a noble big balloon, and had {{wings and}} fans {{and all sorts}} of things, and wasn't like any balloon you see in pictures. It was away out toward the edge of town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street; and there was a big crowd around it, making fun of it, and making fun of the man,--a lean pale feller with that soft kind of {{moonlight}} in his eyes, you know,--and they kept saying it wouldn't go. It made him hot to hear them, and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they was animals and blind, but some day they would find they had stood face to face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations, and was too dull to know it; and right here on this spot their own children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that would outlast a thousand years, but his name would outlast the monument. And then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, and yell at him, and ask him what was his name before he was married, and what he would take <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it, and what was his sister's cat's grandmother's name, {{and all the things that}} a crowd says when they've got hold of a feller that they see they can plague. Well, some things they said WAS funny,--yes, and mighty witty too, I ain't denying that,--but all the same it warn't fair nor brave, all them people pitching on one, and they so glib and sharp, and him without any gift of talk to answer back with. But, good land! what did he want to sass back for? You see, it couldn't do him no good, and it was just nuts for them. They HAD him, you know. But that was his way. I reckon he couldn't help it; he was made so, I judge. He was a good enough sort of cretur, and hadn't no harm in him, and was just a genius, as the papers said, which wasn't his fault. We can't all be sound: we've got to be the way we're made. As near as I can make out, geniuses think they know it all, and so they won't take people's advice, but always go their own way, which makes everybody forsake them and despise them, and that is perfectly natural.
