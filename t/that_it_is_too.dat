5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> early {{to suggest that the}} storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center forecast {{the outer edge of the}} hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E

During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again.

25|$|Some 10,000 {{people work}} {{directly}} or indirectly for the council, in its main offices at Bernard Weatherill House or in its schools, care homes, housing offices or work depots. The council is generally well-regarded, having made important improvements in education and social services. However, there have been concerns over benefits, leisure services and waste collection. Although the council has one of London's lower rates of council tax, there are claims <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> high and that resources are wasted.|$|E

25|$|One {{objection}} {{that has}} been made to this theory is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> complex. While it accounts for many possible sentences, it also requires introducing new rules and constraints, and treats bound variable pronouns differently from other types of pronouns. Proponents of this objection, such as linguist Tanya Reinhart, argue that the difference between bound variable pronouns and pronouns of other kinds should be a semantic rather than a syntactic difference. They propose that a syntactic theory that requires less rules would be a more preferable theory.|$|E
25|$|Opponents contend {{the project}} is based on {{uncertain}} projections about maritime trade and the world economy. Roberto N.

Independent engineers, most notably Humberto Reynolds and Tomás Drohan Ruiz, the former head of engineering and dredging of the Panama Canal, say that the project will cost much more than currently budgeted and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> risky for Panama. M. A.

25|$|K Desktop Environment (KDE) {{was founded}} in 1996 by Matthias Ettrich, who was then {{a student at the}} Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen. At the time, he was troubled by certain aspects of the Unix desktop. Among his {{concerns}} was that none of the applications looked, felt, or worked alike. He proposed the creation of not merely a set of applications but a desktop environment in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently. He also wanted to make this desktop easy to use; one of his complaints about desktop applications of the time was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> complicated for end user. His initial Usenet post spurred a lot of interest, and the KDE project was born.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to know for certain which {{strategies}} will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> soon to call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, Adult Swim has {{frequently}} aired adult animation features, anime, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, live-action, and pilots. Shows may have sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence; in other words, programs {{that would be}} deemed inappropriate if aired during the day on Cartoon Network, when children would be watching. While the network features comedic and dramatic programs of all types, many of its programs are aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and surrealist in nature. Thus, Adult Swim has {{become a source of}} conflict, with some saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurd and shock comedy.|$|E
