5|$|Several {{commentators}} questioned {{what time}} the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad {{arrived at the}} hospital; why <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, {{it is clear that}} protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, {{at the age of}} 62.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be no official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E

5|$|Land {{was also}} {{an issue in the}} coming of the war. While the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who {{seasonally}} engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be no end of settlers in the British colonies, who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.|$|E
5|$|Walter Raleigh Gilbert (16 September 1853 – 26 July 1924) was an English amateur cricketer {{who played}} {{first-class}} cricket for Middlesex and Gloucestershire between 1873 and 1886. A cousin of W. G. Grace, {{he played for}} Gloucestershire when, dominated by the Grace family, it was the leading county. Gilbert's best season was 1876, when he scored 205 not out for the county, but he was subsequently less successful. Closely connected with the United South of England Eleven, a professional touring team of which he eventually became secretary, Gilbert was financially affected by a declining interest in such teams. With insufficient income to continue as an amateur he became a professional in 1886, but played only one match before he was caught stealing from teammates in a minor match, ending his first-class career. After serving a 28-day prison sentence Gilbert moved to Canada, where {{he worked for the}} Land Titles Office in Calgary while remaining a prominent cricketer. He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 years after his death, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a conspiracy of silence over his fate.|$|E
25|$|For {{over twenty}} years, {{government}} and agricultural industry groups battled with the issue, largely unsuccessfully.

The Wild also signed free agents Antti Miettinen and Owen Nolan to multi-year deals. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a stigma about Jacques Lemaire's defensive system that caused a number of top free agents to avoid the Wild.|$|E

25|$|He firmly {{declined}} to confirm their disciplinary arrangements, {{which seemed to}} allow Constantinople a practically equal authority with Rome and regarded the civil importance of a city as a determining factor in its ecclesiastical position; but he strongly supported its dogmatic decrees, especially when, after the accession of Leo I the Thracian (457), <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a disposition toward compromise with the Eutychians.|$|E

25|$|William Gibson's Neuromancer, {{published}} in 1984, announced the cyberpunk {{movement to the}} larger literary world and was a tremendous commercial success. Other key writers in the movement included Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, and later Neal Stephenson. Though Cyberpunk would later be cross-pollinated with other styles of science fiction, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be some notion of ideological purity in the beginning. John Shirley compared the Cyberpunk movement to a tribe.|$|E
25|$|The rumor seemed {{unlikely}} to be true for several reasons: {{the two young men}} came from different states and had never met before being brought to the MacLab; if they were both conspiring with Randi, then the plot had gone on for 21 months.

Dakhlallah said that Syria will merely move its troops to eastern Lebanon. Since then, Syria has declared that Resolution 1559 will be fully complied with, and in a matter of months rather than years.|$|E

One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate Guy Picciotto dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group.

25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem.

Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.|$|E

In denying funding for the study ESA members stated that, among other factors that seemed unfavourable, under the current Russian proposal Europe would not share control over the design of the program and would be limited to being a small industrial contributor.|$|E

25|$|The Ptolemaic {{approach}} of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{no end to}} the mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler {{was the first person to}} abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.|$|E
