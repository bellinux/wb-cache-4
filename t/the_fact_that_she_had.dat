Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused. In 1922 she became {{a fellow of the}} French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{of their}} lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the {{indigenous}} sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never had to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E
5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green {{would have been able to}} preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E

[...] Acknowledging Rice's unique character, Casper told the New Yorker in 2002 that it [...] "would be disingenuous for me to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a woman, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was black and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was young weren't in my mind." ...|$|R
50|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> bore Akbar no children, Ruqaiya {{was always}} kept in high regard by her husband. This was {{evidenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> remained his sole chief consort {{from the time}} of their marriage in 1557 until his death in 1605. Ruqaiya was thus, the most senior lady in the imperial harem and at court during her husband's reign as well as in his successor's (Jahangir) reign. This was primarily due to her exalted lineage, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was Mirza Hindal's daughter, a Mughal princess as well as Akbar's first and chief wife.|$|R
5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those who gathered around the pit, as was <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944, {{the ship}} was due for another overhaul; work was to have lasted for three months. The Soviet Army had {{advanced}} so far, however, {{that it was necessary}} to move the ship farther away from the front, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only one working turbine. On 29 January 1945, the ship left Gotenhafen, arriving in Kiel on 2 February. She entered the Germaniawerft shipyard for refitting. On 3 May, RAF bombers attacked the harbor and severely damaged the ship. Her crew scuttled the wrecked ship at her moorings at 04:25 on 3 May. In July 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, Admiral Hipper was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1952. Her bell was on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The bell has since been returned to Germany and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|More than 99percent of Benet {{graduates}} go to college; roughly 1percent {{serve in}} the military. Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The Chicago Tribune, investigating the scandal, reported {{that a majority of}} students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student was admitted to the university's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put on a waiting list or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{then went}} into drydock for an overhaul, before {{returning}} to Cuban waters for maneuvers with the fleet. She arrived there on 25 February 1915. The {{rest of the year}} was spent with training exercises with the Atlantic Fleet. Another overhaul, at the Boston Navy Yard, from 20 January to January 1916. On 27 January, Georgia was decommissioned temporarily. The same day as the United States' declaration of war against Germany on 6 April 1917, the ship was reactivated for service during World War I. She was assigned to the 3rd Division, Battleship Force, based in the York River, Virginia. She spent most of the war training gunners for the rapidly expanding wartime Navy and conducting tactical training exercises. During this period, the ship frequently had more than a thousand men aboard the ship, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sleeping accommodations for only 750. The ship's commander at the time, Captain Sumner Kittelle, raised concerns about the over-crowded conditions aboard the ship.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} years of their marriage, Davis and his wife were able to holiday in Greece, taking {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> an uncle who lived near Athens.

25|$|Neagle and Wilcox {{followed}} with a circus trapeze fable Three Maxims (1937), which was released in the United States as The Show Goes On. The film, with a script featuring a contribution from Herman J. Mankiewicz (later to co-write Citizen Kane with Orson Welles), had Neagle performing her own high-wire acrobatics. Although now highly successful in films, Neagle continued acting on stage. In 1934, while working under director Robert Atkins, she performed as Rosalind in As You Like It and Olivia in Twelfth Night. Both productions earned her critical accolades, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never performed Shakespearean roles before.|$|E

25|$|Paget and Morgan {{also helped}} Mary's {{ambassador}} to the French court, James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, administer Mary's income from her dower lands in France (said to have been thirty million crowns a year), from which all three were granted pensions. According to Holmes, although Morgan and Paget's enemies accused them of fraud, 'the degree of control which {{they were able to}} exercise over Mary's finances was probably quite slight', and it is known that in 1586 Mary herself concealed from Paget <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> received funds from Philip II of Spain, because she owed Paget 4000 crowns.|$|E

Among criticisms leveled at Post was their addition of a tightly cropped inset photograph of Chien, a former high-school track athlete, depicting her in mid-jump from an athletic meet, giving the false impression that it was taken during her fatal act, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fallen face up.|$|E

Two years later, with Playboy photographer, Kim Mizuno, Kusanagi produced an 80-page, hardcover volume entitled Dangerous Curve which was released in April 2001. In her diary she expressed disappointment that she felt her career had failed.

Callas told the La Scala officials that she was physically exhausted and that she had already committed to a previous engagement, a party thrown for her by her friend Elsa Maxwell in Venice. Despite this, La Scala announced a fifth performance, with Callas billed as Amina. Callas refused to stay and went on to Venice. Despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fulfilled her contract, she was accused of walking out on La Scala and the festival.

25|$|Upon {{her death}} the cities {{that she had}} dwelt in came to revere and acclaim her as a saint while the Dominican nuns she had lived with {{preserved}} her remains at their Peru convent. The cause for her canonization later commenced {{with the beginning of}} the informative process tasked with collecting documentation from 26 September 1961 until the process was closed on 10 July 1962 at which stage her writings received theological approval on 8 July 1965. The officials in charge of the cause sent a large Positio dossier to Rome to the Congregation for Rites for investigation before historians approved the cause on 8 May 1974. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 27 September 1975 and she became titled as a Servant of God as a result. Theologians met to discuss the cause on 24 July 1984 but did not come up with a clear consensus so met again on 20 December 1984 where the group approved the cause. The members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause as well on 16 June 1987.
