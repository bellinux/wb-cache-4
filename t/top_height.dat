5|$|Based in Nui Dat, the SASR was {{responsible}} for providing intelligence to both the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and US forces, operating throughout Phuoc Tuy Province as well as Bien Hoa, Long Khanh and Binh Tuy provinces. From 1966 SASR squadrons rotated through Vietnam on year-long deployments, {{with each of the}} three Sabre Squadrons completing two tours before the last squadron was withdrawn in 1971. Missions included medium range reconnaissance patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory. Operating in small groups of four to six men they moved more slowly than conventional infantry through jungle or bushland and were heavily armed, employing a high rate of fire to simulate a larger force on contact and to support their withdrawal. The primary method of deployment was by helicopter, with the SASR working closely with No. 9 Squadron RAAF which regularly provided rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree <b>top</b> <b>height.</b> On occasion, SASR patrols were also deployed by M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) with a method devised to deceive the Viet Cong as to their insertion and the location of their drop-off point despite the noise they made moving through the jungle. An operational parachute jump was also undertaken.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 two No. 9 Squadron Iroquois {{flown by}} Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley {{completed}} a hazardous mission to resupply D Company, 6 RAR which was heavily outnumbered and running dangerously low on ammunition. The mission proved vital in ensuring {{the survival of}} the Australian infantry until a relief force could fight its way through from Nui Dat and was completed despite heavy rain and the risk of ground fire. Following the withdrawal of the Viet Cong a number of helicopters were used to evacuate the Australian casualties from the battlefield. RAAF-Army relations improved considerably following Long Tan. No. 9 Squadron subsequently developed new operational concepts and procedures, achieving consistently high rates of aircraft availability, mission success and a low loss rate. A close professional relationship was also developed with the Special Air Service which saw the squadron provide rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree <b>top</b> <b>height.</b>|$|E

40|$|Spectroradiometer (MISR) {{are two of}} the {{instruments}} onboard the NASA-TERRA platform. The objective of this research is to compare MODIS cloud top pressures and MISR cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> over the Caribbean region to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of both instruments. Variations in cloud top measurements show the ability of MISR to acquire cloud top information at high levels of the atmosphere. MISR cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> can be approximately 2 to 4 kilometers higher than MODIS cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> in most of the situations when MISR cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> are higher. Other variations between MODIS and MISR cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> may indicate the retrieval of two different cloud heights over the same area when highest error between MISR and MODIS high clouds vary between 15 and 19 kilometers. This observation may indicate that one of {{the instruments}} was detecting a low cloud. Over 9000 meters, MODIS detects higher cloud tops than MISR in 13. 98 % of the total observed area. But MISR detects higher cloud tops than MODIS in 26. 89 % of the total observed area. MISR retrieval performance for high clouds is twice the MODIS retrieval performance. MISR and MODIS cloud values coincide in less than 1 % of the total observed area and the cloud height value is 14 km. Overall results about the observations between MODIS and MISR show that MISR is a better instrument to measure high clouds including optically thin clouds. Future work will incorporate the use of ICESat multi-cloud layer data to validate MISR and MODIS cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights...</b>|$|R

We also found that O 3 -IRW BTD has very similar information of cloud height with IRW channel and O 3 -IRW combination is not appropriate for the two-channel radiance ratio method. 1...|$|R

The objective for this study is to document and understand the differences in echo top characteristics as displayed on both the WSR- 88 D and WSR- 74 C radars and cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> reported by the contract weather aircraft in support of space launch operations at Cape Canaveral Air Station (CCAS), Florida. These inconsistencies are of operational concern since various Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) and Flight Rules (FR) in part describe safe and unsafe conditions as a function of cloud thickness. Some background radar information was presented. Scan strategies for the WSR- 74 C and WSR- 88 D were reviewed along with a description of normal radar beam propagation influenced by the Effective Earth Radius Model. Atmospheric conditions prior to and leading up to both launch operations were detailed. Through the analysis of rawinsonde and radar data, atmospheric refraction or bending of the radar beam was identified as the cause of the discrepancies between reported cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> by the contract weather aircraft and those as identified by both radars. The atmospheric refraction caused the radar beam to be further bent toward the Earth than normal.

2500|$|Most {{populated}} {{areas of the}} earth are now well covered by weather satellites, which aid in the nowcasting of severe convective and tornadic storms. [...] These images {{are available in the}} visible and infrared domains. The infrared (IR: 10-13 µm) images permit estimation of the <b>top</b> <b>height</b> of the clouds, according to the air mass soundings of the day, and the visible (VIS: 0.5-1.1nbsp&µm) ones will show the shape of the storms by its brightness and shadow produced. Meteorologists can extract information about the development stage and subsequent traits of thunderstorms by recognizing specific signatures in both domains. Visible imagery permits the most detailed imagery whereas infrared imagery has the advantage of availability at night. Sensors on satellites can also detect emissions from water vapor (WV: 6-7nbsp&µm), but mostly in the middle to upper levels of the troposphere, so thunderstorms are only seen after being well developed. It is, however, useful in convective storm prediction, as it illustrates the placement and movement of air masses and of moisture, as well as shortwaves and areas of vorticity and lift.|$|E

The average cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> as obtained by these diverse techniques for the whole data set analyzed (931 GOME pixels) differ by 0. 6 km on average, with larger values given by SACURA as applied to GOME data.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the accuracy of MERIS cloud top pressures through an inter-comparison with CO 2 -slicing MODIS cloud top pressures and stereo MISR cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights,</b> both instruments of which are onboard the NASA-TERRA platform. For ground-based “truth ” measurements, millimetre wavelength cloud radars data were used at the ARM SGP and UK Chilbolton sites. Cloud top pressures were transformed into heights using ECMWF Operational analysis profiles. An excellent agreement was found between MERIS, MISR and the radar cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> when single opaque clouds were present. When clouds were optically thin, MERIS cloud top pressure retrievals were not available and when more than one cloud layer was present, MERIS CTH often referred to the lowest cloud top or some altitude between cloud layers. MISR cloud <b>top</b> <b>heights</b> referred to low clouds in multiple layers conditions, due to their higher contrast, and MODIS CTHs were found too low for low clouds, slightly too high for mid-level clouds and within the cloud extent or near the top of high clouds. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} structure {{is an important}} feature of mixed swards, as it influences the inter-species competition for light, {{as well as the}} patterns of grazing. Although the experimental measurement of the vertical sward structure is relatively straightforward, the mechanistic and dynamic modelling of the leaf density and lamina density profiles is complicated by the unpredictability of leaf angles. Therefore only static, descriptive profiles have been incorporated in grassland simulation models to date. Two mechanistic models are presented which predict the leaf and lamina density profiles of perennial ryegrass and white clover, based on variables which can readily be measured or produced by simulation models. The `basic model' for grass requires only three input variables: the average leaf length, the average sheath length, and either the total herbage mass or the Leaf Area Index. For clover, only the average petiole length, and either the total weights or areas of petiole and lamina material are required. Use of this basic model is restricted to the simulation of homogeneous swards in which all herbage material shows a random spatial orientation. The `extended model' is more flexible and capable of simulating a wide range of different sward types. However, it requires variables which have not been produced by simulation so far such as the distributions of leaf <b>top</b> <b>heights,</b> sheath <b>top</b> <b>heights,</b> and petiole <b>top</b> <b>heights.</b> Both models were evaluated against a measured profile of a grass–clover sward. The leaf density and lamina density profiles of both perennial ryegrass and white clover, as predicted by the extended model, closely matched the observed profiles. However, the predictions of the basic model were significantly inaccurate for both ryegrass and clover. The extended model can be incorporated as a sub-model into dynamic grassland simulation models in order to enhance the accuracy of simulation of both competition for light and of grazing...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for proving {{termination}} of term rewriting systems automatically. It is a generalization {{of the match}} bound method for string rewriting. To prove that a term rewriting system terminates on a given regular language of terms, we first construct an enriched system over a new signature that simulates the original derivations. The enriched system is an infinite system over an infinite signature, but it is locally terminating: every restriction of the enriched system to a finite signature is terminating. We then construct iteratively a finite tree automaton that accepts the enriched given regular language and is closed under rewriting modulo the enriched system. If this procedure stops, then the enriched system is compact: every enriched derivation involves only a finite signature. Therefore, the original system terminates. We present three methods to construct the enrichment: <b>top</b> <b>heights,</b> roof heights, and match <b>heights.</b> <b>Top</b> and roof <b>heights</b> work for left-linear systems, while match heights give a powerful method for linear systems. For linear systems, the method is strengthened further by a forward closure construction.
