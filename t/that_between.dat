According to Ashley Jackson's work The British Empire and the Second World War, the Rhodesian Air Training Group instructed 8,235 Allied pilots, navigators, gunners, ground crew and others—about 5% of overall EATS output.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} state's {{maintenance}} of M-117, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed <b>that</b> <b>between</b> 1,392and 1,986vehicles used the highway per day.|$|E

5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate <b>that</b> <b>between</b> 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E

5|$|Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated <b>that</b> <b>between</b> 300 and 3,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly between Washtucna and Ritzville.|$|E

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form anywhere {{within the}} extratropical {{regions of the}} Earth (usually between 30° and 60° latitude from the equator), either through cyclogenesis or extratropical transition. A study of extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere shows <b>that</b> <b>between</b> the 30th and 70th parallels, there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period. A separate study in the Northern Hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter.|$|E
5|$|Findings on the {{frequency}} of each level of severity vary based on the definitions and methods used in studies.

No segment of the trunkline is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways.|$|E

The study concluded <b>that</b> <b>between</b> 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E
