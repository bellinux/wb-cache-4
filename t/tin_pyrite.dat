40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} {{analysis}} of two common decorative/ornamental minerals analysed for minor and trace elements with the {{neutron activation analysis}} technique are discussed. The samples of interest were the Biriniwa <b>tin</b> <b>pyrite,</b> which the local indigenous used to paint their huts and the ornamental lead which women use to adorn their eyelashes nation-wide. These samples were irradiated along the certified reference sample, CANMET-BLI, with thermal neutron at the Julich Reactor Centre, Julich, Germany. The prominent elements determined in the ornamental lead included zinc (35. 8 %), iron (6. 15 %), Na, Sb, Cd, Hg, Ag and Co at trace level (μg g - 1). <b>Tin</b> <b>pyrite</b> sample was found to contain traces of Na, K, As, Br, Sb, Fe, La, Nd, Sm and Ce as the prominent impurities. Lead and tin, the major elements, respectively, of the lead/zinc ore and <b>tin</b> <b>pyrite</b> samples were determined by classical methods...|$|E
50|$|The {{country rock}} at the mine was killas and the mine's main produce was copper, though {{small amounts of}} black <b>tin,</b> arsenic, <b>pyrite</b> and zinc ore were also raised. There are about eight main lodes at the mine, crossed by elvan dykes. The most {{important}} lode was Virgin Lode which was stoped for over 1.3 mi.|$|R
5000|$|Bhutan has {{deposits}} of numerous minerals. Commercial production includes coal, dolomite, gypsum, and limestone. The country has proven reserves of beryl, copper, graphite, lead, mica, <b>pyrite,</b> <b>tin,</b> tungsten, and zinc.|$|R
50|$|The country’s mineral {{industry}} {{was small and}} insignificant to its economy and was dominated by the production of cement, coal, dolomite, gypsum, and limestone. Known resources included deposits of beryl, copper, graphite, lead, mica, <b>pyrite,</b> <b>tin,</b> tungsten, and zinc. A graphite processing plant was established in Paro.|$|R
5000|$|Sanskrit texts {{mention the}} use of bitumen, rock salt, yellow orpiment, chalk, alum, bismuth, calamine, realgar, stibnite, saltpeter, cinnabar, arsenic, sulphur, yellow and red ochre, black sand, and red clay in prescriptions. Among the metals used were gold, silver, copper, mercury, iron, iron ores, <b>pyrite,</b> <b>tin,</b> and brass. Mercury {{appeared}} to have been the most frequently used, and is called by several names in the texts. No source for mercury or its ores has been located. Leading to the suggestion that it may have been imported.|$|R
5000|$|Wheal Peevor was a [...] mine {{located on}} North Downs about 1.5 miles {{north-east}} of Redruth, Cornwall, England. The first mining sett was granted here in around 1701 on land {{owned by the}} St Aubyn family. It was originally mined at shallow depths for copper, but when the price for that metal slumped after 1788, the mine was able to change to mining tin ore, which was found deeper down. In the late 18th century Wheal Peevor {{had the advantage of}} being drained by the Great County Adit which was around 100 metres deep here. [...] The mine covered only 12 acres (4.8 ha) but had rich tin lodes. In addition to <b>tin</b> and copper, <b>pyrite</b> was also mined here between 1872 and 1887.|$|R
