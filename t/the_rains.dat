5|$|The delay {{caused by}} these rearguards may have seriously {{compromised}} the British Empire advance {{as there was}} not much time to conclude military engagements in southern Palestine. The winter rains were expected to start {{in the middle of the}} month and the black soil plain which was currently firm, facilitating the movements of large military units would with <b>the</b> <b>rains</b> become a giant boggy quagmire, impassable for wheeled vehicles and very heavy marching for infantry. With <b>the</b> <b>rains</b> the temperatures which were currently hot during the day and pleasant at night would drop rapidly to become piercingly cold.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the disaster, Luis A. Ferré, the Governor of Puerto Rico, {{declared a state of emergency}} over the whole island, asking for $10 million (1970 USD) in federal aid. On October12, two days after <b>the</b> <b>rains</b> subsided, President Richard Nixon declared the territory as a disaster area. Ferre also appeared in a telethon to raise funds for the homeless. The National Guard, the Red Cross, and other volunteer groups helped the displaced persons. In all, the disaster was described as one of the worst in Puerto Rico history. The Governor of the Virgin Islands, Melvin Evans, requested aid similar to Puerto Rico, and that territory was also declared a federal disaster area about a week after <b>the</b> <b>rains</b> ended.

5|$|During the storm's passage, {{there were}} 61daily {{rainfall}} records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. <b>The</b> <b>rains</b> from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment displaced by <b>the</b> <b>rains</b> {{was estimated at}} 4,456m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630m3 (2,066ft3) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115km/h (72mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119km/h (74mph). The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a Foehn wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly.|$|E

5|$|High rains {{in eastern}} Texas, totaling over , flooded roads in Shelby and Panola {{counties}}; {{damage in the}} two counties collectively totaled $1.5 million.

Five people required rescue after being trapped in a fast-moving river. <b>The</b> <b>rains</b> in the region were considered the heaviest in 17 years, and leaving severe damage to corn, cotton, and watermelon crops. Similarly, the floods damaged cotton and other crops in northern Louisiana, totaling several million dollars in losses. <b>The</b> <b>rains</b> caused many streams to exceed their banks, including one creek near Converse that flooded roads and railways. The floods forced families to evacuate in low-lying areas of northern Louisiana. The rainfall in Shreveport caused the worst floods related to a tropical cyclone on record. While the storm was dropping heavy rainfall, it produced thunderstorms and gusty winds along the Texas and Louisiana coastlines. A severe thunderstorm related to the storm damaged roofs and windows in Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new rain removal model {{based on the}} shrinkage of the sparse codes for a single image. Recently, dictionary learning and sparse coding {{have been widely used}} for image restoration problems. These methods can also be applied to <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> removal by learning two types of rain and non-rain dictionaries and forcing the sparse codes of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> dictionary to be zero vectors. However, this approach can generate unwanted edge artifacts and detail loss in the non-rain regions. Based on this observation, a new approach for shrinking the sparse codes is presented in this paper. To effectively shrink the sparse codes in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and non-rain regions, an error map between <b>the</b> input <b>rain</b> image and <b>the</b> reconstructed <b>rain</b> image is generated by using <b>the</b> learned <b>rain</b> dictionary. Based on this error map, both the sparse codes of rain and non-rain dictionaries are used jointly to represent the image structures of objects and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions. In <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> regions, <b>the</b> correlation matrix between <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and non-rain dictionaries is calculated. Then, the sparse codes corresponding to the highly correlated signal-atoms in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and non-rain dictionaries are shrunk jointly to improve the removal of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> structures. <b>The</b> experimental results show that the proposed shrinkage-based sparse coding can preserve image structures and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions, and it can remove <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> structures in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> regions. Also, visual quality evaluation confirms that the proposed method outperforms the conventional texture and rain removal methods. Comment: 17 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new GPU based {{technique}} to render realistic rain in real-time. It {{consists of two}} parts: off-line image analysis of rain videos, and real-time particle-based synthesis of rain. Videos of real rain are analyzed to extract <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> mattes; random samples of these rain stroke mattes are then used for online synthesis. We in-corporate pre-computed radiance transfer (PRT) in our particle sys-tem {{to take into account}} the scene radiance. The transfer function of a raindrop can be highly efficiently evaluated with a closed-form solution. Our approach achieves high realism with low computa-tion cost and a small memory footprint. Our technique applies to a variety of scenarios, from synthetic 3 D scenes to real videos. 1 Our Technique A major challenge of <b>rain</b> simulation is <b>the</b> realism of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> ap-pearance, including <b>the</b> naturalness of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> shape and <b>the</b> envi-ronmental lighting effect on <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> <b>The</b> existing techniques either manually design limited number of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> mattes (e. g. [ATI Demo 2005]) or simply assume straight rain strokes (as in traditional par-ticle systems). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> color and intensity is either pre-scribed (e. g. [Starik and Werman 2002]) or is computed using the light sources only (e. g. [ATI Demo 2005]). Our technique aims at enhancing the realism of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> strokes by applying <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> mattes extracted from rain videos and incorporating the effect of the whole environment map on <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> strokes using a particle system that utilizes the transfer function of the raindrops. We formulate <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> extraction as an optimization problem: (S,α) = argmin S,...|$|R
