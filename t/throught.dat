I never saw Lady H----d but once, for I was {{kept out of the}} [...] way. Finding that this good Sir J. knew something of her when a [...] girl, and being sure {{that he did not know}} of the death of her little [...] daughter, I boldly said I was the child, and told a pitiful tale of [...] my early life. It worked like a charm; he told Monsieur, and both [...] felt the most chivalrous compassion for Lady Howard's daughter, [...] though before they had secretly looked down on me, and my real [...] poverty and my lowliness. That boy pitied me with an honest warmth [...] and never waited to learn my birth. I don't forget that and shall [...] repay it if I can. Wishing to bring Monsieur's affair to a [...] successful crisis, I got up a theatrical evening and was in my [...] element. One little event I must tell you, because I committed an [...] actionable offense and was nearly discovered. I did not go down to [...] supper, knowing that the moth would return to flutter about the [...] candle, and preferring that the fluttering should be done in [...] private, as Vashti's jealousy is getting uncontrollable. Passing [...] <b>throught</b> the gentlemen's dressing room, my quick eye caught sight of [...] a letter lying among the costumes. It was no stage affair, and an [...] odd sensation of fear ran through me as I recognized the hand of S. [...] I had feared this, but I believe in chance; and having found the [...] letter, I examined it. You know I can imitate almost any hand. When [...] I read in this paper the whole story of my affair with S., truly [...] told, and also that he had made inquiries into my past life and [...] discovered the truth, I was in a fury. To be so near success and [...] fail was terrible, and I resolved to risk everything. I opened the [...] letter by means of a heated knife blade under the seal, therefore [...] the envelope was perfect; imitating S.'s hand, I penned a few lines [...] in his hasty style, saying he was at Baden, so that if Monsieur [...] answered, the reply would not reach him, for he is in London, it [...] seems. This letter I put into the pocket whence the other must have [...] fallen, and was just congratulating myself on this narrow escape, [...] when Dean, the maid of Vashti, appeared as if watching me. She had [...] evidently seen the letter in my hand, and suspected something. I [...] took no notice of her, but must be careful, for she is on the watch. [...] After this the evening closed with strictly private theatricals, in [...] which Monsieur and myself were the only actors. To make sure that he [...] received my version of the story first, I told him a romantic story [...] of S.'s persecution, and he believed it. This I followed up by a [...] moonlight episode behind a rose hedge, and sent the young gentleman [...] home in a half-dazed condition. What fools men are!" ...|$|E

Then, the belief of parents of children who are seeking self-identity <b>throught</b> modeling school become one of the driving factors for students to be more confident without feeling burdened, braver, and not easily shaken in building their own identity. Therefore, parents and trainers should continue to approach students who educate them by motivating them to be more confident and encourage them to open up for positive things, because parents and trainers have an important role in shaping attitudes and character of students who want to seek identity <b>throught</b> modeling school...|$|E
