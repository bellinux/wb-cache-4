50|$|In 1847, {{the first}} <b>{{telegraph}}</b> <b>connection</b> (Vienna - Brno - Prague) started operation. The first telegraph station on Hungarian territory was opened in December 1847 in Pressburg/ Pozsony /Bratislava/. In 1848, during the Hungarian Revolution, another telegraph centre {{was built in}} Buda to connect the most important governmental centres. The first <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> between Vienna and Pest-Buda (later Budapest) was constructed in 1850, and Vienna-Zagreb (capital of the Triune Kingdom of Croatia) in 1850. Austria joined a telegraph union with German states.|$|E
50|$|The station {{yard was}} resignalled in 1884. At this time {{according}} to the Working Timetable, Murphy's Creek consisted of a station building, with <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> and a watering point.|$|E
50|$|Ludwig II {{used the}} castle as his summer residence, moving here {{regularly}} {{every year on}} 11 May and performing the business of state from it. For this purpose he had a <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> installed between the castle and Munich.|$|E
50|$|In 1882-83 the FE&MV (Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad) built westward to Ft. Niobrara and beyond. With the {{railroad}} came reliable <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections.</b> The railroad linked Fort Niobrara with Ft. Robinson 170 {{miles to the}} west. Ft. Robinson was similarly located {{in the state of}} Nebraska, just south of the Great Sioux Reservation boundary and the Pine Ridge Agency where the Oglala Lakota were located. The arrival of {{the railroad}} and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> suddenly increased the potential of the garrisons of the two forts to act in coordinated and concerted military action in the event of trouble on the Sioux Reservation.|$|R
50|$|The earlier {{settlement}} was named Lbishchensk and in 1899 {{the town had}} 3400 people (2100 of which were Cossacks), 2 churches, 2 schools, and mail and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections.</b> It has been renamed to Chapaevo in 1939, and Chapaev in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Gentex is an {{international}} standard (ITU F.20) for the transmission of telegrams over the Telex network. It replaces fixed <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> between stations and means instead that the telegraph station that transmits the telegram connects directly to the receiving station and transmits the telegram with a remote typewriter.|$|R
50|$|In Australia the {{telegraph}} helped {{to alleviate the}} isolation of the colonies. New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia were connected by telegraph by 1860. Queensland's first <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> was made in 1861 between Brisbane and Ipswich. Brisbane was linked to Sydney the same year.|$|E
50|$|Khatgal {{was founded}} in 1727 as a camp of the Mongolian watch post system. By 1910, a small {{settlement}} had formed, mainly through trade with Russia. In 1914 a <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> was established from the Russian border town Mondy to Uliastai via Khatgal, and in 1921 about 150 Russian settlers lived here.|$|E
50|$|By 1914, {{the town}} had Baptist, Christian, and Methodist churches, a bank, a newspaper, a <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection,</b> and a {{reported}} population of 400. Its population was estimated at 300 in the mid-1920s and 350 in the late 1940s. In 1948 {{the town had}} six stores, four churches, a two-teacher school, and a cotton gin.|$|E
25|$|Before {{electronic}} communications, long-distance communications {{relied on}} mail. Speed of global communications was {{limited by the}} maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The electric telegraph was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> were achieved in the 1865-1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.|$|R
50|$|In {{ten days}} of recruiting, however, Palmer {{received}} enough applications for enlistment {{to form a}} regiment, which was authorized as the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry. He was appointed the regiment's colonel. Before Palmer was able to organize the regiment at Camp Alabama in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, he and a portion of it were ordered on September 9 to help the Army of the Potomac resist the Confederates invasion of Maryland. For nearly a week Palmer, accompanied by a telegrapher, personally sought information of Lee's movements every night in civilian clothing, and transmitted his findings to General George B. McClellan via <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R
50|$|Communications {{would be}} a {{daunting}} challenge. The Russian supply of cable was insufficient to run telephone or <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> from the rear; all they had was needed for field communications. Therefore, they relied on mobile wireless stations, which would link Zhilinskiy to his two army commanders and with all corps commanders. The Russians were aware that the Germans had broken their ciphers, but they continued to use them until war broke out. A new code was ready {{but they were still}} very short of the code books. Zhilinskiy and Rennenkampf each had one; Samsonov did not. Hence, many messages were sent in the clear, hoping {{that they would not be}} intercepted.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} {{became the}} business centre for the pastoral {{stations in the}} district, providing services, supplies and port facilities. By the mid-1860s the township of Mackay had a post office, <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> to Brisbane, churches, banks, and a racecourse. The track through the valley and over the range to Fort Cooper pastoral run had been upgraded to a road.|$|E
5000|$|... 14. Telephone Company (TELBO). [...] The first <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> with Curaçao was in 1911. The {{telephone}} lines were laid to Rincon in 1921. The {{construction of the}} telephone began in 1944, and became automatic in 1961. In 1975, Bonaire was the first Dutch island to direct dial internationally. In 1999, Bonaire had its first fiber optic connection via cable under the sea.|$|E
50|$|In 1863 an Order in Council {{transferred}} Northern Territory to South Australia, {{aiming to}} secure land {{for an international}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection.</b> Now with a potential route, South Australia strengthened her position for the telegraph line in 1865 when Parliament authorised {{the construction of a}} telegraph line between Adelaide and Port Augusta, 300 km to the north. This move provoked outrage in Queensland amongst advocates of the Darwin-Burketown route.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 July 1913, the Albanian Provisional Government {{applied to}} {{become a member of the}} General Postal Union, a process that was {{completed}} on 1 March 1922. During this time, 17 offices were connected by [...] of cables. The headquarters in Tirana consisted of a director, four telegraphists, a prime telegraphist, two postal workers and a delivery worker. In 1938, 68 postal offices and agencies operated throughout Albania. As Italian investment grew in the country, the need to communicate with Italy became more important. For this reason, the Albanian government decided to install a short-wave radio station, which enabled telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> between Rome and Tirana.|$|R
25|$|In 1877, Stouffville {{became an}} {{incorporated}} village. Stouffville's growth was {{aided by the}} establishment of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, built in 1871, which connected Stouffville and Uxbridge with Toronto. In 1877, a second track was built north to Jackson's Point on Lake Simcoe. These connections were created in large part to provide a reliable and efficient means of transporting timber harvested and milled in these regions. Soon Stouffville Junction serviced thirty trains per day. During this time of prosperity, Stouffville businessman R.J. Daley built a large music hall, roller-skating rink, and curling rink. In 1911 Stouffville had a public library, two banks, two newspapers, as well as telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R

50|$|In March 1855 the Great Orme {{telegraph}} {{station was}} converted to electric telegraph. Landlines and submarine cables connected the Orme to Liverpool and Holyhead. At first the new equipment {{was installed in}} the original Semaphore Station on the summit until it was moved down to the Great Orme lighthouse in 1859. Two years later the Great Orme semaphore station closed with {{the completion of a}} direct electric <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> from Liverpool to Holyhead.|$|E
50|$|On 9 July 1927, the Greek {{nationals}} T. Zewos and A. Donalis {{were awarded}} {{a contract to}} link the town and Gore by road with Gambela, a distance of 180 kilometers. However, the road from Jimma to Gore was not yet built by 1935. A trip to Addis Ababa took 20-22 days for pack mules and 14-15 days for riding mules. The mail transport from Gore to the capital departed every Monday at 17.00 while the government telephone line was used also as <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
50|$|July 28, 1882, <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> {{was made}} with Fort Maginnis via Camp Poplar River, Wolf Point, Willow Creek, {{crossing}} Missouri River at Hawley Bend, thence to Rocky Point (all on Missouri River), and Fort Maginnis. First Lieut. C. A. Booth, Seventh Infantry, {{in charge of the}} construction party working west from Camp Poplar River, built 108 miles of the line; and First Lieut. F. W. Kingsbury, Second Cavalry, in charge of the party working east from Rocky Point, crossing the wire over the Missouri River, built 70 miles.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted {{in the emergence of}} a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.|$|R
50|$|The first {{interior}} {{power wiring}} systems used conductors that were bare or covered with cloth, which were secured by staples to the framing {{of the building}} or on running boards. Where conductors went through walls, they were protected with cloth tape. s were done similarly to <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections,</b> and soldered for security. Underground conductors were insulated with wrappings of cloth tape soaked in pitch, and laid in wooden troughs which were then buried. Such wiring systems were unsatisfactory because {{of the danger of}} electrocution and fire, plus the high labour cost for such installations.The first Electrical codes arose in the 1880s with the commercial introduction of electrical power, however, many conflicting standards existed for the selection of wire sizes and other design rules for electrical installations, and a need was seen to introduce uniformity on the grounds of safety.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the number}} of camps that {{surrounded}} it, its secure rearward location, and multiple <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> with Washington, Alexandria, and other forts defending Washington, Fort Corcoran became the headquarters for Washington's defenses south of the Potomac River. On September 6, 1862, General Fitz John Porter assumed command of those defenses and made his headquarters at Fort Corcoran. He was only at Fort Corcoran for a short time before he {{and the rest of his}} command were withdrawn from the defenses of Washington in order to counter Lee's advance into Maryland. A bare handful of artillerymen were left to man the guns of the forts along the Arlington Line. Following the climactic Battle of Antietam, Porter and his men returned to Fort Corcoran. A few months following Antietam, Porter was court-martialed for his actions at the Second Battle of Bull Run and was removed from command.|$|R
50|$|The first {{telegraph}} {{station on}} Hungarian territory was opened in December 1847 in Pressburg/ Pozsony /Bratislava/. In 1848, - during the Hungarian Revolution - another telegraph centre {{was built in}} Buda to connect the most important governmental centres. The first <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> between Vienna and Pest - Buda (later Budapest) was constructed in 1850. In 1884, 2,406 telegraph post offices operated in the Kingdom of Hungary. By 1914 the number of telegraph offices reached 3,000 in post offices, and a further 2,400 were installed in the railway stations of the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E
50|$|After Poland regained {{independence}} in autumn 1918 (see: Partitions of Poland), and the symbolic wedding ceremony with the Baltic Sea by {{units of the}} Polish Army under General Józef Haller de Hallenburg (Puck, 10 February 1920), Polish military authorities began preparations of a fortified army garrison along the coast. As early as 22 July 1920 General Kazimierz Sosnkowski ordered construction of a strategic rail line which ran from Puck, through Wladyslawowo, to Hel. The line was completed in 1921, together with <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection,</b> by the logistics units of the Polish Army. A road was constructed along the line.|$|E
50|$|The {{commissioning}} {{took place}} on 15 December 1846, but the renovation and construction of the 173 m-long building complex, the freight tracks and the roundhouse were not completed until 1857. The station had two high towers for an optical <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection,</b> but since an effective electrical telegraph had already been invented, they were purely decorative. The entrance building also had two turntables for locomotives. These were detached from the train {{and turned on the}} turntables so that they could pull the train in the opposite direction. The station precincts, which included a freight yard and a semi-circular engine shed, were about three times as long as the station.|$|E
5000|$|In 1889, {{the company}} had 50 employees. The {{partners}} realized that {{the time was right}} to transform their two-page news summary into a real newspaper. The first issue of The Wall Street Journal appeared on July 8, 1889. It cost two cents per issue or five dollars for a one-year subscription. Dow was the editor and Jones managed the deskwork. The paper gave its readers a policy statement: [...] "Its object is to give fully and fairly the daily news attending the fluctuations in prices of stocks, bonds, and some classes of commodities. It will aim steadily at being a paper of news and not a paper of opinions." [...] The paper's motto was [...] "The truth in its proper use." [...] Its editors promised to put out a paper that could not be controlled by advertisers. The paper had a private wire to Boston and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> to Washington, Philadelphia, and Chicago. It also had correspondents in several cities, including London.|$|R

50|$|The Silver City Water Works Building is a {{historic}} building located on Little Walnut Rd. in Silver City, New Mexico. The building was constructed in 1887 to provide Silver City with a municipal water system. While the city had established an electrical system and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections,</b> it lacked reliable drinking water and a fire prevention system, as an earlier attempt to build a water system was never completed. George H. Utter obtained a contract to supply water to Silver City in 1886, and he commissioned Michigan stonemason John Hill to build the water works. The sandstone water works is the only sandstone building from the 1800s in Silver City, as brick was a much more common building material. While the water system opened and initially operated successfully, by 1890 Utter was accused of supplying undrinkable water and failing to meet the city's expectations for service. East Coast investors Henry and Thomas Foster took over the water works in the ensuing years after an extended legal battle with Utter.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1902, a {{group of}} Seattle {{businessman}} sought to establish a railroad to connect southern Alaska with Fairbanks in the Interior. After crews surveyed many different routes, John Ballaine selected the northern coast of Resurrection Bay as the southern terminus of their route, as the Bay remains free of ice year-round. John Ballaine obtained much of the land for the town site. His brother Frank lived in Seward and was responsible for selling lots in the town and overseeing the railroad construction, as John remained in Seattle. Frank also founded the town's first newspaper, the Seward Gateway, in 1904. When a <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> to Seward was completed, Ballaine provided news from the lower 48 states in his paper.|$|E
5000|$|Field {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the telegraphy after he was contacted in January 1854 by Frederick Newton Gisborne, a Canadian engineer, who aimed to establish a <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> between St. John's, Newfoundland and New York City, started the work, but failed due to the lack of capital. Later that year he, with Peter Cooper, Abram Stevens Hewitt, Moses Taylor and Samuel F.B. Morse, joined the so-called Cable Cabinet of entrepreneurs, investors and engineers. Through this Cable Cabinet, Field became instrumental in laying a 400-mile telegraph line connecting St. John's, Newfoundland with Nova Scotia, coupling with telegraph lines from the U.S. American investors took over Gisborne's venture and formed a new company called the New York, Newfoundland, and London Telegraph Company (N.Y.N.L.T.C.) after Field convinced the Cable Cabinet to extend the line from Newfoundland to Ireland [...]|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} {{partition}} of Poland the town {{became part of}} the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772. In 1864 a <b>telegraph</b> <b>connection</b> to Stettin began operation. In 1868 the town was connected to the railway network. This improved industrial development quite considerably. In 1870 a gas power plant was installed. The town was connected in 1873 by the railway to Dirschau (Tczew) and in 1877 by railway to Stettin. In 1886 a new hospital was built in the town. A new railway line to Nakel (Nakło) was opened in 1894. In the year of 1900 the town obtained both a water supply system and an electricity power plant. In 1902 a railway line to Berent (Kościerzyna) was opened. During the time span 1900-1902 the Konitz ritual murder case & antisemitic pogrom took place. In 1909 a used water system was installed in the town. In 1912 the Gazeta Chojnicka, the first Polish language newspaper, appeared in the town.|$|E
5000|$|Initially the Cree-Assiniboine {{alliance}} won {{the battle}} of Cut Knife. [...] However, Canada used the new railway and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections</b> to deploy Ontario and Quebec militias to the West, where they applied superior numbers, mobility, and firepower against the loose alliance of Cree, Assiniboine, and Métis. The Métis were defeated at Batoche, leaving the Cree-Assiniboine without allies. Poundmaker's mixed Cree-Assiniboine war party surrendered. Three weeks later, Big Bear's band won a victory at Frenchman's Butte, but this was in vain. The last band holding out (Big Bear and Wandering Spirit's) was dispersed at Loon Lake on 3 June 1885. After the rebellion Big Bear and Poundmaker were briefly imprisoned; Wandering Spirit and six other natives were hanged. A few members of Big Bear's band and other Cree sought refuge in the United States. They were extradited back to Canada, but most soon returned to the US and settled on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation, where their descendants live to this day. Big Bear's son eventually returned to Canada and helped found a reservation at Hobbema ...|$|R
50|$|Clodine {{was first}} {{established}} in the 1880s as a station on the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway. Clodine had acquired a Post Office by 1893. In 1896 the town had a general store, a Baptist church, and a population of fifty. Clodine acquired a Community School in the year 1897. By 1914 Clodine had telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>connections,</b> and a population of twenty-five. The Texas and New Orleans Railroad bought the San Antonio and Aransas Pass line in 1934 and removed the depot and section houses. In 1936 the town had gained a factory and several businesses. In 1947 Clodine had a population of fifty and was a shipping point for surrounding farms and a local oil field. In 1990 Clodine had around 31 residents.In 2001 George Bush High School opened. In the early 2003 the rail road was taken up {{to make way for}} the Westpark Tollway. In 2005 the Westpark Tollway was constructed on the former railroad right of way.
