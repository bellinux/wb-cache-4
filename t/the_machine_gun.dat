5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} from <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision {{to move away from}} the concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely used in the same manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E
5|$|At 06:15 the 181st Brigade {{was ordered}} {{to advance to the}} north. The 181st had one machine gun section {{attached}} to each battalion, and the 2/97th Deccan Infantry in reserve. (Prior to this order to advance, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> sections had formed part of the artillery barrage.) By 08:30 the leading troops of the brigade column had crossed the Nahr el Faliq and the causeway at Kh. ez Zebabde.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and {{the largest and most}} drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> Corps were established {{in the southern part of}} Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and the East Coast main line railway station at Grantham. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses which left gaping {{holes in the}} Allied line, {{it was decided that}} the next stage of the advance was to go ahead. At 08:25, parties from the 34th and 35th Battalions headed out along the {{south-eastern}} edge of the ridge towards the outskirts of Passchendaele. Almost immediately, they came under heavy fire from a pillbox close by a railway embankment, at which time Major J.B. Buchanan, the senior brigade officer with the advance party, fell dead, leaving Jeffries to assume control. Gathering a party of eleven men, he set about silencing <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> position. Edging across the open ground, the party attacked the position from the west just as <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> was firing to the north. Realising that an attack was imminent, the machine gunner switched around, mortally wounding Jeffries in the stomach and sending the rest of the party to ground. When its fire eased, the remaining members of the group worked around the position, rushed it and seized two machine guns in conjunction with thirty prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> Corps {{was based in}} the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a {{good state of repair}} and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea was}} that the M19 mortar would be used in {{conjunction}} with <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> especially those mounted in armoured domes. The mortar was to fire into areas that were out of range for <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> such as low spots in the terrain and the far sides of hills. In this way enemy hiding soldiers would be chased out into the open, so that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> could hit them.|$|R

5|$|The 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion {{was one of}} four {{machine gun}} battalions raised as part of the all {{volunteer}} Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) for service overseas during the Second World War. Motorised infantry units, equipped with wheeled motor vehicles and tracked carriers, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions were formed to provide a greater level of fire support than that ordinarily available within infantry battalions. Developed by the British Army, the concept had its genesis in the Australian Army during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, when the machine guns assigned to the infantry battalions—initially two and then four—had been grouped together and co-ordinated at brigade level, to help compensate for the lack of artillery support. On the Western Front, the concept had evolved through the establishment of machine gun companies in 1916 and finally, in 1918, to the establishment of machine gun battalions. Similar formations had also been established among the Australian Light Horse units serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. During the inter-war years, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions had been deemed unnecessary. They were not re-raised when the Army was reorganised in 1921 but in 1937, as the Australian Army looked to expand owing to fears of war in Europe, four such units were formed within the part-time Militia, by converting light horse units and motorising them. Several other Militia machine gun battalions were also raised as new units later after the Second World War began. These were formed by consolidating <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> companies assigned to a number of infantry battalions, and other light horse units were also converted into the role for use as garrison forces. Within the 2nd AIF—Australia's overseas expeditionary force—the decision was made to raise four machine gun battalions as corps troops that were usually allocated at a rate of one per division; several of the Militia units were also later designated Australian Imperial Force units, after the majority of their personnel volunteered for overseas service. This meant that they could be deployed outside of Australian territory even though they were not 2nd AIF units.|$|E

5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Peeler {{was living}} in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond with his wife and three daughters. On 17 February, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War. Posted as a private soldier to <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> section of the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, Peeler {{underwent}} his initial training in Victoria, before departing from Melbourne headed for England aboard HMAT Wandilla on 6 June. The battalion arrived in Plymouth seven weeks later. During the three months Peeler's unit spent in England undergoing additional training, he was charged with being absent without leave for six hours on 3 July, and fined a day's pay. He was nevertheless promoted to lance corporal on 6 November.|$|E

However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
