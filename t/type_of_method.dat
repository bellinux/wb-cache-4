2500|$|Atom-based: Standard {{approaches}} of this type, using atomic contributions, {{have been named}} by those formulating them with a prefix letter: AlogP, XlogP, MlogP, etc. A conventional method for predicting log P through this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> is to parameterize the distribution coefficient contributions of various atoms to the over-all molecular partition coefficient, which produces a parametric model. This parametric model can be estimated using constrained least-squares estimation, using a training set of compounds with experimentally measured partition coefficients. [...] In order to get reasonable correlations, the most common elements contained in drugs (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and halogens) are divided into several different atom types depending on {{the environment of the}} atom within the molecule. [...] While this method is generally the least accurate, the advantage is that it is the most general, being able to provide at least a rough estimate {{for a wide variety of}} molecules.|$|E
60|$|To {{continue}} {{these suggestions}} much further, {{would be to}} write a detailed treatise on education, which we do not purpose. The foregoing outlines of plans for exercising the perceptions in early childhood, for conducting object-lessons, for teaching drawing and geometry, must be considered simply as illustrations of the method dictated by the general principles previously specified. We believe that on examination they will be found not only to progress from the simple to the complex, from the indefinite to the definite, from the concrete to the abstract, from the empirical to the rational; but to satisfy the further requirements, that education shall be a repetition of civilisation in little, that it shall {{be as much as}} possible a process of self-evolution, and that it shall be pleasurable. The fulfilment of all these conditions by one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>method,</b> tends alike to verify the conditions, and to prove that type of the method the right one. Mark too, that this method is the logical outcome of the tendency characterising all modern improvements in tuition--that it is but an adoption in full of the natural system which they adopt partially--that it displays this complete adoption of the natural system, both by conforming to the above principles, and by following the suggestions which the unfolding mind itself gives: facilitating its spontaneous activities, and so aiding the developments which Nature is busy with. Thus there seems abundant reason to conclude, that the mode of procedure above exemplified, closely approximates to the true one.|$|E

40|$|Bootstrap {{method has}} emerged as a {{powerful}} tool for constructing inferential procedures for i. i. d observations. However, the assumption of having i. i. d. observations is crucial. It is easily seen that bootstrap gives incorrect answers if dependence is not taken into account. Two schemes of resampling have been developed. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> take resamples from appropriately residuals obtained by fitting a parametric or semiparametric model. These solutions have been applied with success to ARMA models. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> apply resampling to blocks of the original data to keep the dependence structure of data. The first resampling scheme is based on some model assumptions and therefore is not robust against the violation of the model. The other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> are less model dependent, but the applications is not still automatic. In this paper we review critically these solutions for dependent data with particularly attention to the blocking methods...|$|R
50|$|In most {{physical}} and biological sciences, {{the use of}} either quantitative or qualitative methods is uncontroversial, and each is used when appropriate. In the social sciences, particularly in sociology, social anthropology and psychology, the use of one or other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> can {{be a matter of}} controversy and even ideology, with particular schools of thought within each discipline favouring one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> and pouring scorn on to the other. The majority tendency throughout the history of social science, however, is to use eclectic approaches-by combining both methods. Qualitative methods might be used to understand the meaning of the conclusions produced by quantitative methods. Using quantitative methods, it is possible to give precise and testable expression to qualitative ideas. This combination of quantitative and qualitative data gathering {{is often referred to as}} mixed-methods research.|$|E
