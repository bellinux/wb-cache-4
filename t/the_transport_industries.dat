30|$|The main {{observations}} from the detailed {{results of the}} survey can be summarized as follows. All the studied Wild Cards {{were found to be}} relevant by the experts in terms of their potential impact on <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industries,</b> the breadth of their effect and the vulnerability of the various industry segments. Based on the median of the experts’ responses, 12 Wild Cards will have “high” or “very high” impact on at least one industry segment, if they occur. For only two Wild Cards the fullest impact, on at least one industry segment, is “medium”. The time by which the full impact is reached varies among the Wild Cards.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industries</b> {{have adopted}} the smoke density chamber (SDC) ISO 5659 – 2 (2012) and ASTM E 662, for {{quantification}} of toxic product yields (Fire Test Procedure Code 2010; CEN/TS 45545 – 2 2009) using simple pass/fail chemical detection (e.g. Draeger tubes), conventional or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) gas analysis, despite significant problems of reproducibility. It {{has been suggested that}} the reproducibility problems arise from the single point measurement (the tip of the probe may be in the centre of the plume, below it, or if mixing is more efficient, the upper layer may be recirculated through the flame), or the timing of the effluent sampling may cause instabilities (for example an initial proposal to sample after 8  min was replaced by a proposal to sample when the smoke density reached its maximum). The revised protocol is based on continuous sampling of the fire effluent.|$|E

30|$|Based on the results, a {{scenario}} development linking Wild Cards {{with each other}} and to ongoing social, economic and political trends could be a next step to develop a future perspective for transport. The occurrence of some of the Wild Cards might not only challenge our wisdom, as stated previously, but also challenge our non-wisdom in the field of mobility. Some Wild Cards lead to the conclusion that physical mobility might change towards virtual mobility, at least to a certain degree. This shift might occur without being realized by consumers—if, for example, local 3 D-printing substituted freight transport leading to subsistence economy 2.0. A development of this kind would also lead to a reorientation towards the local in other fields of economic and social life. A hybrid economy and society with revived local community life and virtualized (home) work combined with global contacts, and business relations supported by new technologies could result. In this world, mobility would play a different role—with a transport system rather used for special opportunities than for daily commuting leading to a paradigm shift affecting society, markets, as well as the competitive situations for <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industries.</b>|$|E
40|$|Tribology touches {{every aspect}} of our day to day {{existence}} and the wonder of this is that we are completely unaware how central it is to how we function. Take a snapshot of thebeginning of a normal working day for example. A typical morning start will involve brushing one's teeth with toothpaste containing mild abrasive (with a toothbrush with an optimized design for brushing efficiency), using a shampoo and conditioner which have been tested for frictional properties {{on a wide range of}} hair types, and for those who have the traditional morning fry up - lubricating the pan in advance with cooking oil to provide a boundary layer between the food and the pan and to reduce adhesion and heat transfer. It is clear that tribology plays a major role in our everyday lives. Whether starting out for work by foot, bicycle or car, friction will define whether our shoes or tyres can grip the road surface and whether the brake or clutch will do their job. If it is raining, the speed limit is modified in some countries, testifying to the influence of tribologists in decision making in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{natural fiber}} {{composites}} {{can be very}} cost-effective materials, especially for the building and construction industry (e. g., panels, false ceilings, partition boards, etc.), packaging, automobile, and storage devices, etc. They {{can also be a}} potential candidate for partial replacement of high cost glass/Kevlar fibers to make polymer composites used for low cost applications. From {{the point of view of}} wood substitution, natural fiber composite boards could offer an excellent eco-friendly solution, considering ever-depleting forest reserves and corresponding premiums on wood. Composites based on locally available resources are poised to penetrate the market. Any value-added application avenues for these fiber composites would directly contribute to the economic benefit of their growers. With increasing emphasis on fuel efficiency, natural fiber-based composites are finding wider application in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industries.</b> Hence, the value-added application of natural fiber-based composites made from rural industries will ensure the international market has cheaper substitution materials. Keeping the above in view, this research work has been undertaken to process polymer composites using naturally available resources such as bamboo strips, coconut leaf sticks, etc. The strength property relationships of these composites are evaluated, after subjection to different environments. This study will enable the manufacturer to select these materials for suitable applications. KEY WORDS: polymer, coconut, bamboo...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} two {{experimental methods}} for {{the characterization of}} elastic and damping properties of acoustic porous materials in dynamic regime. Young's or shear moduli and structural damping coefficients of polymer foams or fibrous materials are estimated in practical conditions, i. e. in bending or shear vibrations for temperature and frequency ranges existing in buildings construction or in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industries.</b> The Biot-Johnson-Champoux-Allard theory is {{used to describe the}} poro-visco-elastic behaviour of these materials, modeled as biphasic systems constituted of a solid phase and a fluid one, the air, coupled in time and space. The first method derive from the Oberst's beam one: a transverse displacement is imposed {{at the center of a}} free-free beam. A hierarchical finite element calculus and a non-linear inversion algorithm are used to estimate the material unknown parameters and to determine their evolutions in frequency and temperature. The second method is based on bending vibrations of a multi-layered plate. A simplified numerical calculus is jointly used with the previous inversion algorithm for the same purpose of elastic and damping characterization of poro-visco-elastic materials. Applications to light visco-elastic materials or various foams allow to check the relevance of these two methods compared to the existing ones and fix their limitations...|$|E

40|$|South Africa, {{recognised}} as {{a developing}} economy, is encouraging its citizens to be entrepreneurs through various initiatives and assistance, with a bias towards the previously disadvantage people. This encouragement, from the government, {{has been taken}} advantage of by numerous citizens {{to the detriment of}} themselves, especially in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industry.</b> Kazderich Pro Trans, a small transport entrepreneur, has founded itself based on the notion that businesses will utilize its services frequently based on the preferential treatment, to previously disadvantaged communities. The stakeholders in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industry,</b> however is firstly geared towards maintaining their market share in a fiercely competitive industry with arguably an introspective view of the preferential treatment governmental policies. The purpose of this is to research <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industry</b> and accurately identify <b>the</b> environment <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> businesses operate in, with a view of analysing competencies that attract and retain business. This paper negates the government policy to a minor external environmental factor and argues that the company (Kazderich Pro Trans) should operate on the same principals as its competitors in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> important issue being discussed in this research, the long term strategy, is to make small transport entrepreneurs realise that researching and planning their business are more important than starting it.
