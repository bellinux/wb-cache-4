50|$|Between her {{separation}} from Stephen Bishop in 1965 and the annulment {{of their marriage}} in 1967, Bishop underwent a period of tremendous stress, during which she sought relief <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy.</b> Inspired by this, she decided to train as a psychotherapist herself, continuing to teach English part-time. She said of her time in the education profession that her greatest achievement had been to instil in the pupils, drawn from working class areas of north London, a love of Shakespeare.|$|E

5000|$|No {{evidence}} exists for the repression and recovery of verified, severely traumatic events, {{and their role}} in symptom formation {{has yet to be}} proved. There is also striking absence in the literature of well-corroborated cases of such repressed memories recovered <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy.</b> Given the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse, even if only a small proportion are repressed and only some of them are subsequently recovered, there should be a significant number of corroborated cases. In fact there are none.|$|E
50|$|While some {{specific}} psychosocial issues faced by transgender {{people are often}} addressed <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy,</b> there are psychosocial factors that can influence transgender voice therapy. For example, some clients feel that hormone therapy for transitioning changes concentration and emotional stability, which could affect receptiveness to speech therapy. Davies and Goldberg (2006) also note that an altered voice may feel inauthentic, and it may take time for the client {{to feel as if}} their new voice is an expression of their true self.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral {{addiction}} {{and substance abuse}} disorders are treated similarly; treatment options include exposure and response prevention. No medications have been approved {{for the treatment of}} behavioral addictions. Studies have shown promise in the use of glutamatergic altering drugs to treat addictions other than exercise. Exercise addictions comorbid in patients with an eating disorder may be treated <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> involving education, behavioral interventions, and a strengthened family support structure. In treating the eating disorder, obsessions and compulsions produced by obscured body image ideals will also be treated, this includes exercise addiction.|$|E

50|$|While LBT may be conceptually {{sound and}} have firm {{theoretical}} roots, much of psychotherapy and counseling research {{emphasizes the importance}} of evidence-based practice, that is, interventions and therapeutic approaches that have scientific evidence for their efficacy. Given this, to establish LBT's efficacy and effectiveness empirical validation must occur <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> research methodology {{if it is to be}} considered valid by the psychotherapeutic or counseling communities. Although no such evidence is available, anecdotal evidence for LBT's effectiveness as well as its close relationship with CBT presents it as a possible therapeutic modality.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, Seeman {{published}} {{findings in}} Nature that showed after an autopsy, {{the brains of}} schizophrenics have 50% or more dopamine receptors than the average human brain, though their research also pointed {{to the possibility that}} these additional receptors may have been caused by the medication the schizophrenic patients had been taking as treatment. This led to further research that the medication itself was a cause for the increase of dopamine D2 receptors. During the early 1980s, Seeman’s work was contrary to a prevailing idea that schizophrenia was a socially constructed disorder that could be cure <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy,</b> with Seeman claiming that the source of the disorder was biological instead.|$|E
50|$|John's brother Peter Clement Layard {{served in}} France and {{was killed in}} 1918. On his return to England, John was mentally {{exhausted}} and underwent several attempts to alleviate his troubles <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy.</b> These were unfortunate in various ways. His first analyst, Homer Lane, was arrested for having {{a relationship with a}} female patient. Subsequent work (which served also as a training for Layard in his own exploration of his psyche, and his attempts to make sense of his experiences) took place in England, in Vienna (in 1926), and then in Berlin, where he joined the circle of David Ayerst and his English literary friends.|$|E
50|$|Psychiatric {{research}} has demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy for improving or managing a number of mental health disorders <b>through</b> either medications, <b>psychotherapy,</b> {{or a combination of}} the two.

50|$|The {{psychotherapy}} {{and social}} action model is {{an approach to}} psychotherapy characterized by concentration on past and present personal, social, and political obstacles to mental health. In particular, {{the goal of this}} therapeutic approach is to acknowledge that individual symptoms are not unique, but rather shared by people similarly oppressed and marginalized. Ultimately, the psychotherapy and social action model aims to aid clients in overcoming mental illness <b>through</b> personal <b>psychotherapy,</b> group coping, and collective social action.|$|R
50|$|Patients {{with mental}} {{disorders}} are normally treated by psychiatrists, or psychologists, who both specialize {{in mental health}} and diagnose and treat patients <b>through</b> medication or <b>psychotherapy.</b> These professionals systematically diagnose individuals with mental disorders using specific diagnostic criteria and symptomatology found within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.|$|R
5000|$|D. W. Winnicott in {{his article}} of that name (1958/64) {{highlighted}} {{the importance of the}} capacity to be alone, distinguishing it from both withdrawal and loneliness, and seeing it as derived from an internalisation of the non-intrusive background presence of a mothering figure. Winnicott in his writings always stressed the importance of the baby being allowed [...] "just to lie back and float", and of the [...] "opportunity that the baby has to experience separation without separation". Out of those early experiences emerges the capacity to be alone in (or out of) the presence of others - something which might have to be re-acquired later in life <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since {{at least}} 1914, if not 1909, Hesse had been encountering the newly growing field of {{psychoanalysis}} {{as it moved}} through the German intellectual circles. During the 1910s Hesse felt that his psychological difficulties which he had had as a youth and which he still felt torn by needed {{to be dealt with}} <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy.</b> In 1916-17 he underwent treatment through psychoanalysis with Dr. Josef Lang, a disciple of Carl Jung. Through his contact with Lang and later, in 1921, from having psychoanalysis done by Jung, Hesse became very interested in Jungian analysis and interpretation. Demian is replete with both Jungian archetypes and Jungian symbolism. In addition, psychoanalysis helped Hesse identify psychological problems which he had experienced in his youth, including internal tension caused by a conflict between his own carnal instincts and the strict moralism of his parents. Such themes appear throughout Demian as semi-autobiographical reflections upon Hesse's own exploration of Jungian philosophy.|$|E

50|$|A {{task force}} {{commissioned}} by the APA found that religious identity and how one outwardly identifies one's sexual orientation (see sexual orientation identity) can develop <b>through</b> life. <b>Psychotherapy,</b> support groups, and life events can influence how one identifies privately and publicly. Similarly, self-awareness, and self-conception may evolve during treatment. Some practitioners insist that improvement {{may be seen in}} emotional adjustment (self-stigma and shame reduction), and personal beliefs, values and norms (change of religious and moral belief, behaviour and motivation). However, such an approach to treatment is widely regarded as poorly-advised, risky and potentially damaging to the individual.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis inquires {{into the}} {{problems caused by}} sexually motivated criminal offence in the sexual sphere.

The focus is constricted to adult women with a history of mental trauma following rape in their medical record, who have gone <b>through</b> individual, biosynthetic <b>psychotherapy</b> as a means of dealing with the trauma. The goal is to gain an understanding of rape victims, to understand the principles of biosynthesis, and to determine the specific benefits hereof when healing mental trauma. The theoretical part focuses on the characteristics of the condition of rape victims before psychotherapy. Possible effects of the assault on the victim's subsequent behaviour and personality, as well as the transformation hereof, are described. Symptoms that may occur {{as a result of the}} traumatic event are detailed. Psychosomatic conditions as a consequence of the mental trauma and the importance of body therapy are discussed. Examples of themes, which traumatized clients go <b>through</b> during <b>psychotherapy,</b> are presented. Also, a description of the body oriented psychotherapeutic system, Biosynthesis, is provided. The empirical part of the thesis is identifying specific methods of Biosynthesis.

5000|$|Some {{individuals}} with unwanted sexual attractions {{may choose to}} actively dis-identify with a sexual minority identity, which creates a different sexual orientation identity from their actual sexual orientation. Sexual orientation identity, but not sexual orientation, can change <b>through</b> <b>psychotherapy,</b> support groups, and life events. [...] A person who has homosexual feelings can self-identify in various ways. An individual may come to accept an LGB identity, to develop a heterosexual identity, to reject an LGB identity while choosing to identify as ex-gay, or to refrain from specifying a sexual identity. In a The Wall Street Journal article on reconciling faith and homosexuality, researcher Judith Glassgold, who chaired the task force, stated, [...] "We're not trying {{to encourage people to}} become ex-gay’" [...] and [...] "there has been little research on the long-term effects of rejecting a gay identity, but there is 'no clear evidence of harm' and 'some people seem to be content with that path'".|$|E
