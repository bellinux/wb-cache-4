5|$|Fukuda's <b>training</b> <b>method</b> {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} the student taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the tutelage}} of John Toshack, Alonso's {{captaincy}} marked a resurgence of form for Real Sociedad. Toshack recognised Alonso's potential and invested much time in his young captain, creating a <b>training</b> <b>method</b> designed to improve his touch and control specifically for him. The team cemented its mid-table position in the 2001–02, finishing in 13th place. Alonso appeared consistently in La Liga with 30 appearances {{over the course of}} the season and also scored his first league goal, finishing with a season total of three. Real Sociedad's management changed again in the summer of 2002 with the arrival of Raynald Denoueix, but Alonso kept his place in the first team on the strength of his past performances.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her Olympic and World Equestrian Games successes, van Grunsven holds {{the record for the}} most wins at the Dressage World Cup, winning the event nine times between 1995 and 2008. She has also competed numerous times at the European Dressage Championships, winning seven individual medals and eight team medals between 1991 and 2009. Although van Grunsven has ridden many horses over her career, she won the majority of her top events on two horses: Bonfire and Salinero. Bonfire, upon whom she had many of her early successes, was retired in 2002. Salinero quickly took over as van Grunsven's top horse, and remained in that position until his retirement in 2013, after making a major comeback to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games. Van Grunsven has been closely linked with the controversial <b>training</b> <b>method</b> rollkur, although she has moved to distance herself from the practice after it was banned from international competition.|$|E

40|$|Safety {{issues have}} become a vital issue in the {{management}} of facilities in the construction industry, as the labour-intensive construction industry is particularly {{regarded as one of the}} most unsafe industrial sectors worldwide. To increase workplace safety, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) training has been introduced and pursued. Based on previous research, <b>training</b> <b>methods</b> range from less to more engaging. This paper has reviewed the research from 2006 to present done on effectiveness of different <b>training</b> <b>methods</b> as the first investigation research was carried out in 2006. The literatures were searched through multiple electronic databases for published peer-reviewed articles. Findings have suggested that both <b>training</b> <b>methods</b> were able to impart safety knowledge and safety awareness to the workers; however, more engaging <b>training</b> <b>methods</b> would be more effective on training outcomes. Nevertheless, it was noted that those research projects did not take into consideration on the multiculturalism issue where language communication problem exist. Hence, this research proposes a mix mode of less and more engaging <b>training</b> <b>methods</b> to be applied in a multi-cultural workplace to enhance the effectiveness of training outcomes. This review may provide information on effective safety <b>training</b> <b>methods</b> to be applied in the multi-cultural construction industry...|$|R

2500|$|Clicker {{training}} is a nickname given to an animal <b>training</b> <b>method</b> {{based on a}} bridging stimulus (the clicker) in operant conditioning. The system uses conditioned reinforcers, which a trainer can deliver more quickly and more precisely than primary reinforcers such as food. The term [...] "clicker" [...] comes from a small metal cricket noisemaker adapted from a child's toy that the trainer uses to precisely mark the desired behavior. When training a new behavior, the clicker helps the animal to quickly identify the precise behavior that results in the treat. The technique is popular with dog trainers, but {{can be used for}} all kinds of domestic and wild animals and small children.|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophy}} of parkour {{has been compared}} to that of martial arts. In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: [...] "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?". In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a <b>training</b> <b>method</b> for warriors. [...] "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed {{and you are going to}} sweat like never before." [...] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: [...] "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Korea the Joseon dynasty {{underwent}} a devastating war with newly unified Japan that lasted from 1592 to 1598. The shock of this encounter spurred {{the court to}} undergo a process of military strengthening. One of the core elements of military strengthening was to adopt the musket. According to reformers, [...] "In recent times in China {{they did not have}} muskets; they first learned about them from the Wokou pirates in Zhejiang Province. Qi Jiguang trained troops in their use for several years until they [...] became one of the skills of the Chinese, who subsequently used them to defeat the Japanese." [...] By 1607 Korean musketeers had been trained in the fashion which Qi Jiguang prescribed, and a drill manual had been produced based on the Chinese leader's Jixiao Xinshu. Of the volley fire, the manual says that [...] "every musketeer squad should either divide into two musketeers per layer or one and deliver fire in five volleys or in ten." [...] Another Korean manual produced in 1649 describes a similar process: [...] "When the enemy approaches to within a hundred paces, a signal gun is fired and a conch is blown, at which the soldiers stand. Then a gong is sounded, the conch stops blowing, and the heavenly swan [...] is sounded, at which the musketeers fire in concert, either all at once or in five volleys (齊放一次盡擧或分五擧)." [...] This <b>training</b> <b>method</b> proved to be quite formidable in the 1619 Battle of Sarhu when 10,000 Korean musketeers managed to kill many Manchus before their allies surrendered. While Korea went on to lose both wars against the Manchu invasions of 1627 and 1636, their musketeers were well respected by Manchu leaders. It was the first Qing emperor Hong Taiji who wrote: [...] "The Koreans are incapable on horseback but do not transgress the principles of the military arts. They excel at infantry fighting, especially in musketeer tactics." ...|$|E
