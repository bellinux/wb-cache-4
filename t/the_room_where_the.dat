5|$|The dog {{leaves the}} house and swims back across the river, {{down the street and}} into its master and mistress's home. In a study, the child's father is sitting; Rover enters and pleads with him to follow. They leave, with the man {{following}} the dog across the river in a boat to the slums. They enter <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> child is hidden, and the father quickly takes the child from the beggar woman and leaves with the dog. Upon their return home, the child is placed in the arms of the mother, while Rover prances happily around them.|$|E
5|$|Hsin {{wins the}} lottery, but selects the tile {{representing}} his heart. Chao {{comes in and}} tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over {{the table with the}} vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced Man, after which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.|$|E

5|$|Ledward (Benjamin Rigby) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. He {{is a member}} of the expedition tracking the signal leading to the crashed Engineer ship on the surface of the Engineer homeworld. Shortly after disembarking from the lander, Ledward is assigned by Lope to escort Karine Oram as she takes samples from the local ecosystem. Ledward excuses himself from his duties momentarily to smoke and urinate, during which time, he disturbs a mutated floral pod, causing airborne mutagen to enter his ear canal. His health immediately deteriorates and he is assisted to the lander by Karine. Inside the lander's medical bay, Faris locks Ledward and Karine in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> first Neomorph bursts out of his spine, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{catch up}} with the truck, and while {{pursuing}} it encounter strange weather. The truck stalls, but when they head inside it they find both Druce and the E.B.E. have vanished. When they investigate the truck and the area, Mulder concludes that the encounter was a constructed hoax, intended to convince the duo to cease further pursuit. With help from MUFON and NICAP, Mulder tracks Druce and the E.B.E. to a power plant in Mattawa, Washington. With assistance from the Lone Gunmen, the agents are able to enter the plant with fake identification. Their unfamiliarity soon gives them away, but Mulder flees from the guards through a restricted area and is about to approach <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> creature is held when armed guards stop him.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{negotiations}} from succeeding, Price rigs the Summit {{hotel with}} explosives. To prevent Pakistani President Mudasser (Nicholas Khan) and Home Secretary Andrew Lawrence (Tobias Menzies) from escaping, he paralyses both of them. Learning Price {{is in the}} hotel, Lucas and Ros arrive and capture him. Since disarming the bomb is impossible, Ros threatens to leave Price behind when the bomb explodes unless he divulges the room both politicians are held. Although Price eventually discloses the room number, Ros leaves him in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> bomb is anyway. Lucas is able to carry Mudasser safely out of the hotel, where he recovers and orders {{the release of the}} Indian submarine, preventing the war. However, Ros is still in the hotel, struggling to pull Lawrence to safety. As Lucas runs back to aid her, the hotel explodes, killing Lawrence, Price and Ros.|$|E

25|$|In March Amnesty International (AI) {{visited the}} Provincial Inspectorship of Kinshasa, {{one of the}} main police {{detention}} centers in the city. Out of 100 prisoners visited by AI, more than 20 showed signs of ill-treatment, including open—and sometimes fresh—wounds on legs, arms, and heads; cigarette burns; and friction burns on wrists. These prisoners had received no medical care. They allegedly were daily tied to pillars, beaten with sticks and bricks, and kicked. Those inflicting the abuse regularly demanded money. Prison officials refused AI access to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> abuses allegedly occurred. The deputy commander of the prison claimed no knowledge of the abuse.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00am, {{one of the}} assassins, Hamdi Quran, went to {{the dining}} room of the hotel to make sure that Minister Ze'evi would indeed be there in {{accordance}} with his routine schedule. At 06:20am Ze'evi and his wife Yael went down {{to the dining room}} of the hotel. When Quran noticed the minister was in a dining hall, he immediately went back to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> assassins were staying and updated his associates. As a result, two assailants headed towards their vehicle, which was parked in the hotel's basement parking lot, to fetch their pistols which were modified with silencers. In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator.|$|E
25|$|From Cyprus, {{where they}} took refuge {{at the end}} of the Latin Kingdom, the Franciscans started {{planning}} a return to Jerusalem, given the good political relations between the Christian governments and the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. Around the year 1333 the French friar Roger Guerin succeeded in buying the Cenacle (<b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Last Supper took place) on Mount Zion and some land to build a monastery nearby for the friars, using funds provided by the king and queen of Naples. With two papal bullae, Gratias Agimus and Nuper Carissimae, dated in Avignon, 21 November 1342, Pope Clement VI approved and created the new entity which would be known as the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land (Custodia Terrae Sanctae).|$|E

25|$|The regular-length version {{features}} Superfly {{performing the}} song {{with a band}} in an old Western-style stone building, overgrown with creeping vines. This version features a lot of added animation and distorted images, featuring black-and-white flames and bubbles. The art style features many grainy distortions {{in the style of}} a printed comic, and many patterns based on newsprint. Much of the animation focuses of images of soccer balls, which fly out of the television set in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> band plays, and out of the building's windows. Occasionally, the animations are only additions to the scenes, while other times the entire shots have been animated. At certain points, Ochi and her back-up band are represented as cartoons, and in others, Ochi performs the song with people in gorilla suits.|$|E
25|$|The SS plan to {{evacuate}} the camp. They order camp elder Krämer, {{who is also the}} communists' covert leader, to organize the prisoners for transport. Krämer manages to stall the preparations by pretending to cooperate. Resistance leader Bogorski, a Soviet prisoner-of-war, reveals that he hid the child on his own, where Kluttig would not find him. As the deadline for evacuation nears, the boy is taken out from his hiding. Kluttig enters <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> inmates are gathered, intending to shoot the child, but the prisoners form a wall around him and force Kluttig to leave. Krämer orders an armed uprising. The prisoners, led by Bogorski, drive out the remaining SS. Most of them survive and flee wearing civilian clothing. Höfel and Kropinski are freed from their cells. Krämer takes the boy out as the camp is liberated.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} Amy Lee {{dressed in a}} nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are {{performing}} in another room as Lee awakens and makes {{her way to the}} window. Lee climbs out of the window and climbs the building with the wind blowing her hair and dress until she reaches the window of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.|$|E

25|$|Richard Cotton's {{alterations}} to the Great Hall (now the library) {{are thought}} to include concealing the hammerbeam roof with a plaster ceiling and putting in a fireplace. Timbers {{in one of the}} bedrooms have been dated to around this time. It is unclear whether he installed a grand staircase to access the Hall, which is on the first floor. The room's existing screen is believed to date from somewhat later; it is known to have been moved at some point from its original northern position to {{the south side of the}} Hall, where it now stands. William III stayed at the house in 1690, while travelling to the Battle of the Boyne, and his visit may have been the cause of internal reorganisation. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> king is thought to have slept, known as the Orange Bedroom, is adjacent to the Great Hall; its timbers have been dated to 1546–81.

The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact {{the events of the}} interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office.|$|E

In Elysium, Mega Man reaches <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Carbon Reinitialization Program is to be {{executed}} from.

In battle, Gatz tries to aid Mega Man by attacking Sera's logic circuits, but dies in the attempt. As Mega Man defeats Sera, Yuna arrives at the scene reminding Sera that it is not their Master's wish for her to die. Sera awakes in Yuna's real body and decides to help Yuna protect the Carbons from the machines that are being activated in Terra due to an old system Master tried to stop. However, due to Gatz's death, Mega Man, Sera and Yuna are now stranded in Elysium with no means of transporting back to Terra any time soon.
