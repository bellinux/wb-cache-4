5|$|At 9a.m. on July4, Berger {{left her}} {{apartment}} for the Mother Earth offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb had exploded prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger's <b>tenement</b> building, wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently {{was not involved}} in the conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men's funerals.|$|E

The {{law practice}} occupied the four upper floors of the building; shops were on the lower level. Pitfour's legal services were in great demand {{and he was able}} to charge twice the fees of his associates.|$|E
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided <b>tenement</b> flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the many}} horrors that {{occurred}} in the <b>tenements</b> of New York were the trenches that were often found. These trenches were used as unmarked, mass graves for those who died in the <b>tenements.</b> Due to the massive amount of poverty suffered by those who were living in <b>tenements,</b> death occurred at a rapid rate, linking poverty and the trenches closely together. People were not able to afford anything; however, they were able to live inside the <b>tenements.</b> Death spread quickly, affecting people's lives at <b>tenements,</b> and ultimately, leading to their bodies being dumped in the trenches.|$|R

5|$|Colt {{purchased}} a large {{tract of land}} beside the Connecticut River, where he built his first factory in 1848, a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee <b>tenement</b> housing. He established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak Hall, where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.|$|E

5|$|On November 6, {{an angry}} crowd {{surrounded}} the Indiana Statehouse, listed their grievances, demanded the military leave the city, and threatened more violence if their demands were not met. Ralston addressed {{the crowd to}} promise concessions if the workers would return to work. His speech was credited by the press with ending the strike. After three days of peace, the military withdrew from the city. The Indiana General Assembly met later that month and enacted Indiana's first minimum wage laws, regular working hours, workplace safety requirements, and began projects to improve the city's <b>tenement</b> slums.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the <b>tenements</b> {{further south}} on Washington Street {{were of a}} lower class, {{considered}} “foul,” while the <b>tenements</b> further north on Washington Street near Rector Street, like No. 109, were for the slightly better-off immigrants and were viewed as “better class,” most likely because they were newer than the many converted warehouses and rowhouses further down on Washington Street. Once a pervasive building type in the area, these “old law” <b>tenements</b> were “low, red brick <b>tenements</b> whose fronts were scrawled over with fire escapes” and consisted of apartments {{of three or four}} rooms and “whose rears opened down into desolately dark courts.” ...|$|R

5|$|The Oriel Street {{site was}} {{acquired}} between 1329 and 1392. No. 12, now staircases 19 and 20, {{is the oldest}} <b>tenement</b> acquired by the college; known as Kylyngworth's, it was granted to the college in 1392 by Thomas de Lentwardyn, Fellow and later Provost, having previously been let to William de Daventre, Oriel's fourth Provost, in 1367. A back wing to the property was added around 1600 and further work to the front was conducted in 1724–38. In 1985, funded by a gift from Edgar O'Brien and £10,000 from the Pilgrim Trust, Kylyngworth's was refurbished along with Nos. 10, 9 and 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included {{a number of significant}} figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a Celtic Revival, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of <b>tenement</b> flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|William Thompson {{was born}} on 16 August 1927 in Brooklyn, New York to an {{unmarried}} mother. Little is known of Thompson's early life, but {{he grew up in}} an impoverished <b>tenement</b> house neighborhood. He dropped out of school at a young age, and spent his teen years wandering the streets. A local minister noticed Thompson sleeping in a park one evening and took him to a homeless shelter, the New York Home for Homeless Boys. Thompson remained a resident there until he turned 18 in 1945.|$|E

5000|$|Originally each {{head of a}} parcel-holding {{family had}} the right to vote in Chief Pleas, but in 1604 this right was {{restricted}} to the 39 original <b>tenements</b> required by the Letters Patent, the so-called [...] <b>Tenements</b> (quarantaine: French for a group of forty). The newer parcels mostly did not have the obligation to bear arms. In 1611 the dismemberment of <b>tenements</b> was forbidden, but the order was not immediately followed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tenements</b> {{make up a}} large {{percentage}} of the housing stock of Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland. Glasgow <b>tenements</b> were built to provide high-density housing for the large number of people immigrating to the city in the 19th and early 20th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution, when the city's population boomed to more than 1 million people. Edinburgh's <b>tenements</b> are much older, dating from the 17th century onwards, and some were up to 15 storeys high when first built, which made them among the tallest houses in the world at that time. Glasgow <b>tenements</b> were generally built no taller than the width of the street on which they were located; therefore, most are about 3 - 5 storeys high. Virtually all Glasgow <b>tenements</b> were constructed using red or blonde sandstone, which has become distinctive.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 1700s, John Tynte owned {{what is now}} the Tyntesfield estate; at that time the house was {{approached}} by an avenue of elm trees, planted after they were bequeathed in the 1678 will of Sir Charles Harbord to the people of Wraxall in memory of two boys he had apprenticed from the village. The Tynte's had originally lived on the estate, but by the early 1800s, John had made Chelvey Court in Brockley his principal residence. Tynte's Place was downgraded to a farmhouse and leased to John Vowles. In 1813, George Penrose Seymour of the adjoining Belmont estate purchased the property and gave it to his son, the Rev. George Turner Seymour. He in turn built a new Georgian mansion {{on the site of the}} former Saddler's <b>Tenement,</b> and demolished the old farmhouse. Further remodelling was undertaken by Robert Newton of Nailsea.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Buczynski {{was born}} on January 28, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York to working class parents. His father Edmund, after whom he was named, was the {{youngest}} son of Polish parents and had been raised in a Brooklyn <b>tenement</b> with four brothers and two sisters. Enlisting in the Naval Armed Guard in 1943, he fought in the Second World War aboard two Liberty ships, the SS John Howard and the SS José Marti. Eddie's mother, Marie Mauro, was the granddaughter of southern Italian migrants and {{had grown up in}} a Brooklyn apartment. She began communicating with her future husband in 1944 as pen pals before meeting him when he returned home on leave.|$|E
5|$|In the mid {{and late}} 1840s, {{immigrants}} from Ireland and Germany streamed into the city, swelling {{the population of}} Philadelphia and its suburbs. In Philadelphia, as the rich moved west of 7th Street, the poor moved into the upper class' former homes, which were converted into tenements and boarding houses. Many small row houses crowded alleyways and small streets, and these areas were filthy, filled with garbage {{and the smell of}} manure from animal pens. During the 1840s and 1850s, hundreds died each year in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts from diseases such as malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, and cholera, related to poor sanitation and diseases brought by immigrants; the poor suffered the most fatalities. Small rowhouses and <b>tenement</b> housing were constructed south of South Street.|$|E
5000|$|Such <b>tenements</b> (or [...] "walk-ups") were {{particularly}} prevalent in New York, where in 1865 a report stated that 500,000 {{people lived in}} unhealthy <b>tenements,</b> whereas in Boston in 1845 {{less than a quarter}} of workers were housed in <b>tenements.</b> One reason New York had so many <b>tenements</b> was the large numbers of immigrants; another was that the grid pattern on which streets were laid out and the economic practice of building on individual 25- by 100-foot lots combined to produce extremely high land coverage, including back building. Prior to the 1867 law, <b>tenements</b> often covered more than 90 percent of the lot, were five or six stories high, and had 18 rooms per floor of which only two received direct sunlight. Yards were a few feet wide and filled with privies where they had not been entirely eliminated. Interior rooms were unventilated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tenements</b> were {{cheap and}} easy to build, and filled up almost the entire lot. There were {{typically}} five story walk-ups, with four separate apartments on each floor. There was minimal air circulation and sunlight. Until the reforms of 1879, newly built <b>tenements</b> lacked running water or indoor toilets. A law in 1901 required indoor plumbing be retrofitted to older <b>tenements.</b> Garbage pickup was erratic {{until late in the}} 19th century. Rents were cheap for those who could endure the dust, clutter, smells and noises; the only cheaper alternatives were squalid basement rooms in older buildings. Most of the <b>tenements</b> survived until the urban renewal movement of the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Required {{under the}} New Law {{to include a}} large {{courtyard}} which consumed more space than the 1879 Old Law's air shafts, New Law <b>tenements</b> tend to be built on multiple land lots or on corner lots to conserve space for dwelling units, the renting {{of which is the}} money-making purpose of the structure. In the early 21st century, a typical Lower East Side or [...] "East Village" [...] street will still be lined with five-story, austerely unornamented pre-law (pre-1879) <b>tenements</b> and six-story, bizarrely decorated Old Law (1879-1901) <b>tenements,</b> with the much bulkier, grand-style New Law <b>tenements</b> on the corners, always at least six stories tall.|$|R
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem <b>tenement.</b> He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E
5|$|Sienkiewicz {{was born}} on 5 May 1846 in Wola Okrzejska, now a village in {{the central part of}} eastern Polish region of Lubelskie, then part of the Russian Empire. His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side {{deriving}} from Tatars who had settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His parents were Józef Sienkiewicz (1813–96) and Stefania, née Cieciszowska (1820–73). He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (died during January Uprising), and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria. His family were entitled to use the Polish Oszyk coat of arms. Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska. His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in Grabowce Górne, Wężyczyn and Burzec. In September 1858 he began his education in Warsaw, where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a <b>tenement</b> house (kamienica) in eastern Warsaw's Praga district. He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.|$|E
5|$|The English {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Darby Creek watershed due to the proximity to trading routes and productive landscape. In 1777, British soldiers breached dikes and floodwalls that were constructed on the creek. The Pennsylvania legislature passed an act in 1788 that mandated a maintenance of the dikes and the mowing of plants such as elderberries and pokeweed three times a year. Early English colonists utilized Darby Creek {{as a source of}} water power. Lumber, grist, and textile mills were established {{along the banks of the}} creek. Most of these mills have been demolished, although some of the <b>tenement</b> structures are currently in use as housing. At the end of the 19th century, industrial advances such as engine-driven machinery had made these mills obsolete.|$|E
50|$|No more {{traditional}} <b>tenements</b> {{were to be}} built after these, though they together with the Deer Park <b>tenements</b> mentioned above still highly sought-after places to live. The flats above the Tavern Pub in Tollcross Road are pre-First World War.|$|R
50|$|Although {{typified by}} <b>tenements</b> the <b>tenements</b> {{in their own}} right are not {{necessarily}} typical. Great Junction Street has an abnormal number of flat-roofed <b>tenements.</b> These survived the ravages of the Scottish weather due to their novel construction; three inches of horse hair and tar (strong, flexible and impervious). These roofs normally survive well until tackled by Housing Repair Grant projects, which invariably replace them with felt, not appreciating the durability and value of the original roof.|$|R
50|$|In side streets, {{there are}} {{a large number of}} <b>tenements</b> {{constructed}} before 1914: over 30 <b>tenements</b> by Joseph Święcicki, 19 from Rudolf Kern, 14 from Fritz Weidner and a number of them by other builders (i.e. Karl Bergner, Paul Böhm, Erich Lindenburger).|$|R

Geddes established an informal college of <b>tenement</b> flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.|$|E
5|$|The {{topography}} of Coatbridge {{was an important}} feature in the towns development during the industrial revolution. Coatbridge rests 60 metres below the 'Slamannan plateau' which neighbouring Airdrie {{sits on the edge}} of. The low-lying flat ground of Coatbridge was a vital factor in the siting of the towns' blast furnaces and the Monkland Canal route. Although Airdrie was an already established town and had local supplies of ironstone, the Monkland Canal link did not extend into Airdrie because of its higher elevation. The Clyde Valley plan of 1949 described Coatbridge as 'situated over a flooded coalfield'. <b>Tenement</b> buildings in Coatbridge were not built to the same level as Glasgow tenements due to danger of local subsidence from centuries of local mining.|$|E
5|$|When he was five, Kanae and {{his mother}} joined Ichirō in Tokyo and settled in a <b>tenement</b> house in the San'ya area. His mother did sewing work to help support the family, and with her sister Tama {{provided}} maid service to the Mori household, and thus Kanae often met his younger cousin, Kaita Murayama, who, like Kanae, {{was to make a}} career in art. The painter Harada Naojirō, whom Ōgai had befriended when the two were studying in Germany, asked Kanae's mother, whom he had seen at the Mori household, to model for the painting Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon of 1890. Such occurrences may have contributed to attracting Kanae to art.|$|E
50|$|People {{impacted}} by the project were resettled at a resettlement site in Mankhurd, which is about 7 km from the location of affected structures at SCLR phase-II. The Mankhurd resettlement site had a total of 3,256 residential <b>tenements</b> and 720 commercial <b>tenements.</b>|$|R
