5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest <b>trading</b> <b>entity,</b> {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in the present study}} integrates the types of <b>trading</b> <b>entities</b> in order to clearly determine them. A first reference theme when setting-up a business is that of the legal personality it would take. The new Civil Code, acting as common law in the field of <b>trading</b> <b>entities,</b> determines the realignment and balancing of the regulations on types of business. 	Company Law 31 of 1990 preserves the types of <b>trading</b> <b>entities</b> with legal personality regulated here: general partnership, limited partnership, limited partnership by shares, limited liability company, joint-stock company. 	The simple partnership which can gain legal personality is widely regulated, and for the partnership are mainly preserved the landmarks drawn by the Commercial Code of 1886 that is presently repealed. 	In conclusion, the present study analyses and answers the question – who are the legal <b>trading</b> <b>entities</b> and what are the regulated types of business...|$|R
