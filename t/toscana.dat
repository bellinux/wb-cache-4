25|$|Having a {{doctoral}} degree in both medicine and philosophy from the University of Pisa {{at the age}} of 21, he worked in various cities of Italy. A rationalist of his time, he was a critic of verifiable myths, such as spontaneous generation. His most famous experiments are described in his magnum opus Esperienze Intorno alla Generazione degl'Insetti (Experiments on the Generation of Insects), published in 1668. He disproved that vipers drink wine and could break glasses, and that their venom was poisonous when ingested. He correctly observed that snake venoms were produced from the fangs, not the gallbladder, as was believed. He was also the first to recognize and correctly describe details of about 180 parasites, including Fasciola hepatica and Ascaris lumbricoides. He also distinguished earthworms from helminths (like tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms). He possibly originated the use of the control, the basis of experimental design in modern biology. A collection of his poems first published in 1685 Bacco in <b>Toscana</b> ("Bacchus in Tuscany") is considered among the finest works of the 17th-century Italian poetry, and for which the Grand Duke Cosimo III gave him a medal of honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{race in the}} spring season was the Amstel Gold Race. This race, like the other Ardennes {{classics}} to follow, is much more hilly than the cobbled classics, and thus the three leaders from {{earlier in the season}} were not part of the team's squad. The team did send the runner-up from the 2010 race, Hesjedal, and he felt himself to be on strong form entering the race. However, the Canadian was quite sick on race day, with stomach issues that caused him to be second from last in this year's edition, over 14 minutes down on the winner. The team's best finisher was Fischer in 28th. Hesjedal had largely recovered for La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, but he was not a factor in the conclusion to either race, coming 13th in Flèche Wallonne and 29th in Liège. He was the team's best finisher in Liège, but Le Mével did him better in Flèche Wallonne, riding to ninth place to secure 6 UCI rankings points. Martin took his first win of the season at the Giro della <b>Toscana</b> in June. Le Mével {{had been part of the}} last breakaway group to be caught before the finale, occupying first position on the road into the final kilometer of the race on the steep Stoppe d'Arca climb. Martin was part of a six-man group that caught and overhauled him, and he won the sprint to deliver for the team.|$|E

[...] His regiment repulsed an attack of superior numbers of Ottoman forces on 28 September 1788, at Zemun, near Belgrade, for which he received a personal commendation and earned his promotion to major. In his early military career Klenau demonstrated, not only at Zemun {{but also in the}} earlier skirmishing and raids of 1778 and 1779, the attributes required of a successful cavalry officer: the military acumen to evaluate a situation, the flexibility to adjust his plans on a moment's notice, and the personal courage to take the same risks he demanded of his men.|$|E
500|$|Van Avermaet was the team's top {{finisher}} {{at each of}} the Ardennes classics, {{though he}} did not come especially close to victory in any of them, finishing 24th at the 2011 Amstel Gold Race, 16th at La Flèche Wallonne, and seventh at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the fourth monument. BMC's record at the early-season single day races ended with a series of near misses in May and June. Murphy, an essentially unknown rider on the international scene, was the sixth-place finisher at the inaugural ProRace Berlin. BMC and [...] were the only top-level professional teams in the race. Santambrogio was second at the Giro della <b>Toscana,</b> losing out to 's Dan Martin in the uphill final sprint.

2500|$|Tuscan wine (Italian <b>Toscana)</b> is Italian {{wine from}} the Tuscany region. Located in central Italy along the Tyrrhenian coast, Tuscany {{is home to}} some of the world's most notable wine regions. Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano are {{primarily}} made with Sangiovese grape whereas the Vernaccia grape is the basis of the white Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Tuscany is also known for the dessert wine Vin Santo, made from a variety of the region's grapes. Tuscany has thirty-three Denominazioni di origine controllata (DOC) and eleven [...] Denominazioni di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG). In the 1970s a new class of wines known in the trade as [...] "Super Tuscans" [...] emerged. These wines were made outside DOC/DOCG regulations but were considered of high quality and commanded high prices. Many of these wines became cult wines. In the reformation of the Italian classification system many of the original Super Tuscans now qualify as DOC or DOCG wines (such as the new Bolgheri label) but some producers still prefer the declassified rankings or to use the Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) classification of <b>Toscana.</b> Tuscany has five sub-categories of IGT wines today.|$|E

2500|$|After {{taking some}} time {{to recover from the}} Giro d'Italia, Le Mével was again the squad leader for the Vuelta a España.

The world champion had already signed to ride for the [...] in 2012, but {{made it clear that he}} wished to ride the Vuelta as part of his world championships preparation, something he had done in 2010 when he won the championship. Vaughters denied that Hushovd's transfer was the sole reason for his exclusion. He reiterated, as he had before the Tour de France, that the team had numerous riders capable and worthy of riding the Grand Tours.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Brunello di Montalcino, {{producers in the}} Montalcino region can produce wine under Rosso di Montalcino, Sant'Antimo and Moscadello di Montalcino DOCs {{as well as the}} generic Indicazione geografica tipica designation of <b>Toscana</b> IGT. Moscadello di Montalcino is a sweet white wine made from Muscat. The style was once widely produced in Montalcino but fell out of style following World War II. In the early 1980s, the wine estate of Castello Banfi attempted to revive the style by planting Muscat. The Sant'Antimo DOC was named for the 9th century abbey built by Charlemagne. In the 1970s, producers in Montalcino were influenced by the success of the [...] "Super Tuscan" [...] style of wine that was gaining international recognition for Chianti producers who deviated from DOC regulations with winemaking techniques such blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. In 1996, Italian authorities approved the Sant'Antimo DOC to allow Montalcino producers to produce DOC designated wines that were not 100% Sangiovese. These wines include blended Bianco and Rosso wines as well as varietally labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot grigio, Pinot nero and Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
2500|$|The Arte dei Vinattieri guild {{established}} strict {{regulations on}} how the Florentine wine merchants could conduct business. No wine was to be sold within [...] of a church. Wine merchants were also prohibited from serving children under 15 or to prostitutes, [...] and thieves. In the 14th century, an average of [...] of wine was sold every year in Florence. The earliest references to Vino Nobile di Montepulciano wine date to the late 14th century. The first recorded mention of wine from Chianti was by the Tuscan merchant Francesco di Marco Datini, the [...] "merchant of Prato", who {{described it as a}} light, white wine. The Vernaccia and Greco wines of San Gimignano were considered luxury items and treasured as gifts over saffron. During this period Tuscan winemakers began experimenting with new techniques and invented the process of governo which helped to stabilize the wines and ferment the sugar content sufficiently to make them dry. In 1685 the Tuscan author Francesco Redi wrote Bacco in <b>Toscana,</b> a 980-line poem describing the wines of Tuscany.|$|E
2500|$|The marchese Piero Antinori {{was one of}} {{the first}} to create a [...] "Chianti-style" [...] wine that ignored the DOC regulations, {{releasing}} a 1971 Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon blend known as Tignanello in 1978. He was inspired by Sassicaia, of which he was given the sale agency by his uncle Mario Incisa della Rocchetta. Other producers followed suit and soon the prices for these Super Tuscans were consistently beating the prices of some of most well known Chianti. Rather than rely on name recognition of the Chianti region, the Super Tuscan producers sought to create a wine brand that would be recognizable on its own merits by consumers. By the late 1980s, the trend of creating high quality non-DOC wines had spread to other regions of Tuscany, as well as Piedmont and Veneto. Modification to the Chianti DOC regulation attempted to [...] "correct" [...] the issues of Super Tuscans, so that many of the original Super Tuscans would now qualify as standard DOC/G Chianti. Most producers have brought their Super Tuscans back under legal regulations, notably since the creation of the less restrictive IGT <b>Toscana</b> designation in 1992 and the DOC Bolgheri designation in 1994, while the pioneer Sassicaia was prized with its own exclusive Bolgheri Sassicaia DOC.|$|E
