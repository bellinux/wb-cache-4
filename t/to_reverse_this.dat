5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But as soon as he became leader, Brezhnev began <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define {{what he described as}} a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|The town of Chesham grew {{rapidly in}} the 19th century. After the parish was {{transferred}} to the Diocese of Oxford, reforms introduced by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, led to the parish being partitioned, eventually becoming four independent parishes (Chesham, Latimer, Waterside and Ashley Green). In 1980 it was decided <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> decision, and over the 1980s and 1990s three of these parishes (Chesham, Waterside and Ashley Green) were reunited under St.Mary's Church.|$|E

5|$|Yaropolk {{is found}} aiding {{his father and}} his uncle Vsevolod in 1078, when Oleg Svyatoslavich (and his brother Boris) {{attempted}} to gain the throne of Chernigov from Vsevolod. Oleg had been allied to the Polovtsy, and with their help defeated Vsevolod in battle. Grand Prince Izyaslav and Yaropolk, as well as Vsevolod's son Vladimir Monomakh, were able <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> result, and Oleg was forced to retreat to Tmutorokan.

5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have {{corrupted}} her. The Federation equips her {{suit with a}} Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds; and that she must destroy the seeds <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
40|$|Most {{universities}} and research institutions in sub-Saharan Africa {{are limited by}} inadequate resources and research expertise. The few appropriately qualified academics have a large teaching workload (in addition to a clinical workload {{in the case of}} clinicians). Additionally, young researchers who take up training opportunities overseas rarely return home because of a scarcity of career opportunities and incentives. The Southern Africa Consortium for Research Excellence (SACORE) aims <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>this</b> trend by establishing a vibrant environment to support training and research in southern Africa...|$|R

40|$|Consider {{democracy}} in America {{through the lens}} of the presidential debates. It is not a pretty picture. From a high point in the nineteenth century (for example, the lengthy Lincoln-Douglas Senate campaign debates of 1858) a declining trajectory {{can be traced to the}} present day, with a marked acceleration in the Age of Television. To our polity 2 ̆ 7 s discredit, the presidential debate has long since ceased to be a dialogue that might shed light on the candidates 2 ̆ 7 true powers of deliberation.

25|$|In 1989, a {{contract}} {{was signed by}} band leader, Derek Warfield, signing rights to an American distributor.

50|$|Fox Point Boulevard, later George M. Cohan Boulevard, was {{a surface}} {{boulevard}} connecting the Washington Bridge {{west to the}} Point Street Bridge and downtown Providence.

25|$|Hadrian, the {{subsequent}} emperor, shifted the fourth legion (Legio IV Flavia Felix) from Berzobis to Singidunum in Moesia Superior, suggesting that Hadrian believed {{the presence of}} one legion in Dacia would be sufficient to ensure {{the security of the}} province.

25|$|The various terms all {{point to}} the same basic idea of Buddhism, as {{described}} in five skandhas and twelve nidānas: sense-contact with objects leads to sensation, perception, Saṅkhāra ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.), and consciousness.

The aim of the Buddhist path is <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> causal chain: {{when there is no}} (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.|$|E
25|$|This union lasted {{just over}} a year and {{produced}} few if any benefits for either party. In March 1823, Iturbide was overthrown in Mexico, and the empire was replaced by a republic. The Central American Congress, in which Comayagua but not Tegucigalpa was represented, was quickly convened. With little debate, the United Provinces of Central America declared their independence from Mexico. Mexico's only effort <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> decision consisted in maintaining control over Chiapas, the northernmost of the six previous provinces of Central America.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{lines of}} thinking, the ageing process is routed into a basic {{reduction}} of biological complexity, and thus loss of information. In order <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>this</b> loss, gerontologist Marios Kyriazis {{suggested that it}} is necessary to increase input of actionable and meaningful information both individually (into individual brains), and collectively (into societal systems). This technique enhances overall biological function through up-regulation of immune, hormonal, antioxidant and other parameters, resulting in improved age-repair mechanisms. Working in parallel with natural evolutionary mechanisms that can facilitate survival through increased fitness, Kyriazis claims that the technique may lead to a reduction of the rate of death as a function of age, i.e. indefinite lifespan.|$|E

25|$|In many respects, anion–π {{interaction}} {{is the opposite}} of cation–π interaction, although the underlying principles are identical. Significantly fewer examples are known to date.
