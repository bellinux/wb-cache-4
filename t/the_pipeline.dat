5|$|Although Georgia has no {{significant}} oil or gas reserves, its territory hosts {{part of the}} Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline supplying Europe. Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against the construction of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pipeline</b> circumvents both Russia and Iran. Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{has been a major}} factor in the United States' support for Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{caused a}} massive {{economic}} boom in towns {{up and down}} <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b> By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 {{by the summer of}} 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pipeline</b> Authorization Act {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{to be able}} {{to withstand}} the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
50|$|Main <b>pipelines</b> of <b>the</b> western corridor, {{also known}} as the Bratstvo or Brotherhood <b>pipeline</b> system, are <b>the</b> Soyuz <b>pipeline</b> (Orenburg-Western border <b>pipeline),</b> <b>the</b> Progress <b>pipeline</b> (Yamburg-Western border <b>pipeline)</b> and <b>the</b> Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod <b>pipeline.</b> In addition, it consist of <b>the</b> Yelets-Kursk-Dykanka <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Kursk-Kyiv <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Kyiv-Western border <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Komarno-Drozdovychi <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Ivatsevichy-Dolyna <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Torzhok-Smolensk-Mazyr-Dolyna <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Uzhhorod-Berehove <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Dolyna-Uzhhorod <b>pipeline,</b> and <b>the</b> Khust-Satu Mare <b>pipeline.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Main <b>pipelines</b> of <b>the</b> {{southern}} {{transit corridor}} are <b>the</b> Yelets-Kremenchuk-Kryvyi Rih <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Shebelinka-Dnipropetrovsk-Kryvyi Rih-Rozdilna-Izmail <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Kremenchuk-Ananyiv-Bohorodchany <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Ananyiv-Tiraspol-Izmail <b>pipeline,</b> and <b>the</b> Rozdilna-Izmail <b>pipeline.</b> [...] <b>The</b> gas import <b>pipelines</b> are <b>the</b> Ostrogozhsk-Shebelinka <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Urengoy-Novopskov <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Petrovsk-Novopskov <b>pipeline,</b> and <b>the</b> Orenburg-Novopskov <b>pipeline.</b>|$|R
30|$|Next, it was {{investigated}} whether {{the size of}} the parcels through which pipelines pass are different. A significant difference between <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> in terms of the size of parcels was found (see Tables  7, 8, 9, 10). Because the average size of the parcels affected by the construction of <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> is different for <b>the</b> three <b>pipelines,</b> <b>the</b> comparison of <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> in terms of parcel size could be also made.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{various forms of}} artwork. The most notable form of art unique to <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe cut {{into the shape of}} Alaska with a piece of metal delineating the path of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{was built}} to {{withstand}} earthquakes, forest fires, and other natural disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake damaged some of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> sliders designed to absorb similar quakes, and it caused <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> to shut down for more than 66 hours as a precaution. In 2004, wildfires overran portions of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> {{but it was not}} damaged and did not shut down.|$|E
5|$|To {{supervise}} {{the construction of}} <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee all the other subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor for <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> itself. Fluor Alaska Inc., a division of Fluor Corp., was named the management contractor for the pumping stations and Valdez Marine Terminal, which was the most complex single section of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> since it involved the transfer of oil from <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> to seagoing oil tankers.|$|E
50|$|The integer unit {{consisted}} of two integer <b>pipelines</b> and <b>the</b> integer register file. <b>The</b> two <b>pipelines,</b> <b>the</b> add <b>pipeline</b> and <b>the</b> multiply <b>pipeline</b> are not identical, each are responsible for executing different instructions, although both are capable of executing common add, logical, load, compare, and conditional move instructions. <b>The</b> multiply <b>pipeline</b> exclusively executes shift, store, and multiply instructions (in a non-pipelined multiplier). <b>The</b> add <b>pipeline</b> exclusively executes branch instructions.|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the {{war there}} were {{extended}} arguments over how <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> should be used. In 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> for $143,127,000, <b>the</b> largest post-war disposal of war-surplus property. The corporation converted them to transport natural gas, transforming the energy market in the north-east. The Little Big Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957. <b>The</b> <b>pipelines</b> are owned by Spectra Energy Partners and Enterprise Products and remain in use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a SRAM design using <b>the</b> <b>pipelining</b> technique {{which has been}} used in many microprocessors extensively. The main purpose to design SRAM with <b>the</b> technique of <b>pipelining</b> is to improve the whole performance of the SRAM based on the characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>pipelining</b> technique that it can incease exponentially the circuit performance. A 2 -stage pipelining 4 K SRAM has been verified by simulation, and the results demonstrate that the performance of the read operation can be improved twice if <b>the</b> <b>pipelining</b> technique has been used compared with the conventional SRAM operation...|$|R
5|$|Among Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project {{encouraged}} {{organization and}} the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Only after Native land claims were recognized in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act did <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> progress.|$|E
5|$|Because most of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{was built}} above permafrost, {{each of the}} pipes holding up the raised {{sections}} of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|Decline in oil {{production}} has posed {{a serious problem}} for <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pipeline's</b> {{main line}} was in use {{for less than}} {{fourteen}} months (1943/12/19-1945/04/01). <b>The</b> Canol <b>pipeline</b> actually consisted of four sections. Although the Norman Wells section was shut down, oil was received from Skagway and pumped to Fairbanks and a pipeline was also extended from Whitehorse to Watson Lake. <b>The</b> <b>pipeline's</b> route is now a wilderness hiking trail—the Canol Heritage Trail.|$|R
50|$|The {{natural gas}} trunk {{pipeline}} system stretches 10,138 kilometers. <b>The</b> major transit <b>pipelines</b> are <b>the</b> Central Asia-Center gas <b>pipeline</b> system and <b>the</b> Bukhara-Urals <b>pipeline,</b> which transport natural gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Russia, and Orenburg-Novopskov pipeline and Soyuz pipeline from Orenburg processing plant to Europe. <b>The</b> Gazli-Bishkek <b>pipeline</b> transports natural gas from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan. The Central Asia-Center and <b>the</b> Bukhara-Urals <b>pipelines</b> as also <b>the</b> Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty <b>pipeline</b> are also main import <b>pipelines.</b> <b>The</b> main gas export goes to Orenburg processing plant in Russia. The export to Russia goes also through the Central Asia-Center and <b>the</b> Bukhara-Urals <b>pipelines.</b> There is {{plan to build a}} natural gas pipeline to China. To supply this <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> Ishim (Rudny)-Petropavlovsk-Kokshetau-Astana <b>pipeline</b> is planned.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> July 2007 <b>pipeline</b> attacks, President Calderón {{deployed}} 5,000 special {{troops to}} secure <b>the</b> <b>pipelines,</b> along with dams and power plants. These troops began regular patrols {{of the region}} both {{on the ground and}} in the air. However, Pemex has 60,000 km of pipeline so {{it will be difficult to}} secure <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> from saboteurs.|$|R
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
5|$|In {{building}} <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> engineers faced a {{wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> was {{designed}} with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, and other features. <b>The</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{was designed to be}} pressurized, so any leak would be instantly detected by a loss of pressure at one of the pump stations, which could sound an alarm and halt the flow of oil quickly.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{supported}} <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> project {{even before}} the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of <b>the</b> <b>pipelines,</b> and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|R
5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route. In a report, Brewer said the hot oil conveyed by <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> would melt the underlying permafrost, causing <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was passed along to the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{also has}} had a human toll. Thirty-two Alyeska or {{contract}} workers were killed during the construction project.
