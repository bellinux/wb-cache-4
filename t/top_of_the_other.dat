Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that, when placed one on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> became a small compass.|$|E
5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and {{threw it in the}} air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-A visual {{cryptography}} {{scheme is}} a secret sharing scheme to encode a secret image SI {{in such a way}} that any qualified subset of participants can ―visually ‖ recover the secret image, while forbidden subsets have no information on SI. A ―visual ‖ recovery consists <b>of</b> xeroxing <b>the</b> shares, which are shadow images, onto transparencies and stacking them one on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> <b>The</b> participants in a qualified subset will be able to see the secret image without any knowledge of cryptography and without performing any cryptographic computation. Visual cryptography is a powerful tool for teaching cryptography to general audience. Applications have also been proposed to realize authentication, identification schemes and, recently, e voting schemes.

50|$|Baseball was {{and still}} remains another {{dominant}} {{sport in the}} area. In the past there wasn’t an established little league, but games would be played spontaneously almost anywhere, including playground ball fields, vacant lots and even the street. Teams would be formed by alternate selection until everyone present was chosen by one team or <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>The</b> team captain {{to make the first}} choice was determined by tossing a bat with the handle up to one captain, who would grab it in one hand. Each captain would alternately place a hand on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> hand until there was no more room on the bat. The last hand determined the first choice.|$|R

The common bow consists of two half-knots tied one on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.|$|E

25|$|The {{ceremonial}} centers {{were always}} built to be visible. The pyramids {{were meant to}} {{stand out from the}} rest of the city, to represent its gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All of the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters. Stelae were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.|$|E
25|$|Building of Boca Juniors' current stadium {{began in}} 1938, under the {{supervision}} of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname La Bombonera ('The Chocolate Box'). The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked one on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> the only way that makes it stand into the club premises.|$|E
25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hydrotalcite is a cheap, {{human health}} {{friendly}} material {{that belongs to}} <b>the</b> class <b>of</b> anionic clays. <b>The</b> lamellar matrices <b>of</b> anionic clays are formed by positively charged layers, counterbalanced by exchangeable interlayer anions; their high adsorption and high anionic exchange capacities allow using them as biocompatible matrices for designing drug – clay formulations. For <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug delivery <b>the</b> micromorphology features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hybrid drug-clay formulations are very important. We present here new results regarding <b>the</b> textural features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrotalcite-like anionic clay incorporated with cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used like technique to analyze <b>the</b> micromorphology characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibiotic-clay hybrid formulations. The studied samples were obtained by using direct coprecipitation method or the calcination – reconstruction method; their structural features were studied by using XRD analysis. The inorganic matrix and the organic drug both contribute to establish the specific micromorphology characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials.

30|$|AUFS is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most popular}} layered filesystems {{that rely on}} union mounting. The main idea behind union mount is that a set of {{directories}} are mounted with a specific order and the final filesystem is <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> files contained to each distinct directory. Whenever one wants to read a file, the uppermost layers are scanned first and, if the file is not found, the search is continued to the bottom layers. Each layer may be mounted with different permissions; usually, the topmost layer is mounted with read-write access and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layers are mounted with read-only access. When a write operation takes place, the updates are only written to the topmost, read-write layer, keeping <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layers intact. The same happens when deleting a file: Instead <b>of</b> physically removing <b>the</b> file from its layer, a new special file is generated, demonstrating that the target file is not available. This mechanism inherently supports filesystem snapshots: Prior to each script execution, a new layer is mounted on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> If <b>the</b> script fails, then the newly allocated layer is removed and, hence, all the scripts’ side-effects are canceled. In different case, new layers are appended on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing ones.|$|R
25|$|People try to {{stay awake}} and eat toshikoshisoba, noodles to be eaten at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor {{performs}} the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers {{for the well-being of}} the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed one on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a bottle of champagne.|$|E
