5|$|An {{expressway}} through Clare County {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Harrison to the east. The former route of US27 along M-61 and 1st Street/Clare Avenue in Harrison was designated Bus. US27 at this time. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US27 designation in the state; <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 {{to make the}} change. After <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state to reflect the new parent highway designation.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the Canada 2011 Census, the {{government}} announced that the long-form questionnaire (which collects detailed demographic information) {{will no longer be}} mandatory. According to Minister of Industry Tony Clement, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> made because of privacy-related complaints and after consulting with Statistics Canada.

5|$|An {{expressway}} through Isabella and Clare counties {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Clare to the east. The former route of US27 along McEwan Street and Clare Avenue was designated Bus. US27 at this time. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US10 was rerouted along the US27 freeway to connect {{from the new}} bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US10 at this time, running along Bus. US27 to connect to US27/US10 north of downtown. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US27 designation in the state; <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change.

5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{received}} {{permission from}} the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US10 to Bay City, and when <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus. US10 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US24, including the segment concurrent with BL I-75. Wide Track Drive through downtown was renamed as the Woodward Avenue Loop in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009 a {{trial was}} {{undertaken}} {{to turn off}} traffic lights in Portishead.

5|$|In the mid-2000s, {{the route}} was reconfigured in the {{northern}} part of Medina to use Main and Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> made as part of a village project known as the Pass Thru Project, and the realignment eliminated a three-block overlap with the easternmost part of NY31E on Center Street. Ownership and maintenance of NY63's former alignment was transferred from the state to the village on July1, 2010, as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave Commercial Street and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} little {{opposition}} during the consultation period before the alterations were made. However, opposition to {{the reduction of the}} water area grew. The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised for being non-transparent and sneaky. Some organisations complained that they were not given an opportunity to express their opinion before <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> gazetted, and many politicians and the chief town planner were not informed. Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members of the Royal Canberra Golf Club, whose course was situated on the location of the proposed West Lake, were responsible for the change in policy.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E

5|$|Series veteran Michael Ironside did not reprise {{his role}} as the voice of Sam Fisher. His part was played by Eric Johnson, who also {{performed}} the motion capture.

5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack.

5|$|Successive Reichsstatthalter decrees between 1933 and 1935 {{effectively}} {{abolished the}} existing Länder (constituent states) of Germany and {{replaced them with}} new administrative divisions, the Gaue, headed by NSDAP leaders (Gauleiters), who effectively became the governor of their respective regions. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> never fully implemented, as the Länder were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments such as education.

5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, {{refused to sign}} on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.|$|E
