5|$|Red Cap Garage, {{sometimes}} abridged as Red Cap, was a gay bar and nightclub that {{operated in}} Portland, Oregon from 1987 to 2012. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> connected to two others called Boxxes and the Brig. It hosted drag queen shows, live music, special events, and viewing parties. In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> sold and closed after operating for 25 years, {{and the building}} which housed Red Cap was gutted {{to make way for}} the retail alley known as Union Way.|$|E
5|$|Next at <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> William Beamiss {{indicted for}} highway robbery of Hugh Robert Evans, of Ely. Two witness were called. Mr Justice Abbott summed {{up and the}} jury {{returned}} a verdict of guilty on the prisoner Beamiss.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>was</b> introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
50|$|By way of example: a <b>bar</b> of {{material}} <b>is</b> fed forward through the spindle. The face of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> machined (facing operation). The outside of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> machined to shape (turning operation). <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> drilled or bored, and finally, the part {{is cut off}} (parting operation).|$|R
25|$|A ball hit over <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> worth one point. A {{ball that}} <b>is</b> hit under <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> called a goal and is worth three points.|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} of construction of <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> <b>is</b> manganese steel to reduce wear. Usually, <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> shaped {{in such a way}} that its top is wider than the bottom, and hence <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> can <b>be</b> made fairly deep for strength without being choked by lumps passing partway through them.|$|R
5|$|The Black Cat {{opened in}} 1906, {{shortly after the}} 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the early years, <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> located in the {{basement}} of the Athens Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel. When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911, he turned it into a showplace for vaudeville-style acts. Over the next several years, Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution. In 1921, the bar lost its dance permit and closed down.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, {{he had decided}} to become a barrister. There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with <b>the</b> <b>Bar,</b> <b>was</b> a member of the Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings was literally penniless.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the spring}} of 1918, the 18th Battalion was {{involved}} in operations to repel the German offensive. Maxwell took part in these actions until he was granted leave {{and went back to}} England on 17 July. He returned to France and rejoined the 18th Battalion on 1 August, before taking part in the Battle of Amiens where he was to earn a Bar to his Military Cross. On 9 August, the battalion was preparing to attack near Rainecourt. Maxwell took command of the company after all of its other officers became casualties. Under his leadership, the company was able to attack on time, despite being subjected to heavy fire. A tank that preceded the advance immediately became the object of enemy fire and was knocked out by a 77mm gun. Maxwell, who was in close proximity, rushed over and opened the hatch, allowing the crew to escape. After escorting the tank commander to safety, Maxwell returned to lead the company in the attack, which succeeded in reaching and consolidating their objective. The award of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 1 February 1919.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Boost Max Choc was {{introduced}} to Australia. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> coated in Cadbury chocolate and made of chewy chocolate caramel surrounding a mixed smooth chocolate and crispy chocolate biscuit centre. <b>The</b> <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> 58g each.|$|R
50|$|Darren Doane {{directed}} the song's music video. The inside scenes of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Dixie Tavern in Marietta, Georgia. The outside scenes of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>were</b> filmed at <b>The</b> Trap located at 2822 East Avenue I, Lancaster, California.|$|R

5|$|The new 3rd Army Ranger Infantry Company was {{formulated}} {{based on}} the Table of Organization and Equipment documents of Ranger units in World War II, all {{of which had been}} deactivated. The 3rd Ranger Infantry Company was organized into three platoons. A headquarters element of five men oversaw the platoons. However, due to lack of battalion support for clerical, transportation, supply and mess kitchen support, 3rd company had to acquire the personnel, vehicles, and other equipment needed to support their operations. This resulted in the involvement of considerably more highly trained personnel than the five called for by the TOE. Each platoon had three squads of ten men each, with a platoon sergeant and assistant platoon sergeant (a.k.a. platoon guide). Each squad had two fireteams of five men each and one man in each fireteam carried a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. <b>The</b> <b>BAR</b> <b>was</b> the largest weapon in the platoon. The 60mm M2 mortars, the 57mm recoilless rifles, and the M20 Super Bazookas were carried on the company M35 2½ ton cargo truck but seldom used. The company was authorized two vehicles; an M38 Jeep and an M35 2½ ton cargo truck. The company was more heavily armed than the Eighth Army Ranger Company but less in strength and fire power than standard infantry companies. Like the other numbered Ranger companies, its organization called for five officers and 107 enlisted men in three platoons.|$|E

25|$|Another bar {{to employ}} female impersonators in the Barbary Coast was Finocchio’s, {{which opened in}} 1929. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> opened by Joseph Finocchio and was on Stockton Street. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> seen as the symbol of gay life for 10 years, being a {{well-known}} place for gay men to socialize together. Finocchio’s employed female impersonators that would eventually gain fame, such as Ray Bourbon.|$|E
50|$|The Marco Polo Chocolate <b>Bar</b> <b>is</b> a {{chocolate}} covered hazelnut wafer candy which {{is sold in}} 1.2 ounce (34 g) bars at some candy retailers.The candy is easily identified by its distinctive green and white wrapper. <b>The</b> chocolate <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> produced in Poland.

5000|$|<b>The</b> top <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> {{extended}} {{further than}} <b>the</b> other <b>bars</b> to facilitate exercises where the user hangs vertically. <b>The</b> <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> 40 mm thick and oval shape.

25|$|Between 1900 and 1905 {{the club}} also {{operated}} a licensed bar, but despite improving he club's finances this venture caused some controversy, and <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1905.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> {{specially}} {{constructed in}} an empty storefront in Mingo Junction, Ohio for $25,000; it later became an actual saloon for local steel mill workers. U.S. Steel allowed filming inside its Cleveland mill, including placing the actors around the furnace floor, only after securing a $5 million insurance policy. Other filming took place in Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|Pascal (Pa) - {{the unit}} of {{pressure}} - the air pressure in car tyres is typically around 200kPa, equivalent to 200,000 Pa. The Earth's atmospheric pressure is about 100kPa, and thus historically an alternative unit, <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> <b>was</b> defined as 100kPa. For weather forecasting, the hectopascal or millibar (both equivalent to 100 Pa) are widely used.|$|E
30|$|The three supports, which hold <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> <b>were</b> {{accurately}} aligned using {{a standard}} 30  mm diameter chrome rod, produced by Bosch Rexroth Corp. An identical rod {{was also used}} to produce <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> (<b>the</b> raw material which was used to produce <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> <b>is</b> a standard 30  mm chrome rod, produced by Bosch Rexroth Corp).|$|R

25|$|His {{life and}} work are celebrated in two {{prominent}} ways – the annual John Hewitt International Summer School – and, less conventionally, a Belfast pub is named after him – the John Hewitt Bar and Restaurant, which is situated on the city's Donegall Street and which opened in 1999. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> named after him as he officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which owns the establishment. It is a popular meeting place for local writers, musicians, journalists, students and artists. Both the Belfast Festival at Queen's and the Belfast Film Festival use the venue to stage events.|$|E
25|$|A {{public debate}} followed, {{with the result}} being that a joint {{committee}} between the Law Society and <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>was</b> formed to discuss {{the future of the}} legal profession. Known as the Marre Committee after its chairwoman, Mary Marre, The Committee was established in April 1986 and made its report in July 1988. The Committee had not been a successful one—the result was split, with the solicitor members and six of the seven independent members recommending the extension of solicitors' rights of audience to the Crown Court, with the Bar representatives and one independent member disagreeing and attaching a Note of Dissent to the final report that undermined its conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, Gravano {{opened an}} afterhours club in Bensonhurst. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> {{the scene of}} a violent altercation one night, {{involving}} a rowdy biker gang intent on ransacking the establishment, which may have served as inspiration for a similar scene in the 1993 film A Bronx Tale. A melee ensued, in which Gravano broke his ankle and the bikers were chased off. Gravano then went to Castellano and received permission to murder the leader of the gang. Along with Milito, Gravano hunted down the leader, wounding him and killing another member of the gang. Castellano was flabbergasted when he learned the crutch-ridden Gravano personally took part in the hit.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the loss}} of their {{conveyancing}} monopoly, solicitors turned to the barrister's monopoly on rights of audience and attempted to have it removed. In March 1984 the Council of the Law Society of England and Wales attempted to press for full rights of audience for solicitors, something <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>was</b> heavily opposed to. The dispute {{came to the attention of}} the public when Cyril Smith's solicitor asked to read out a statement settling a libel action in the High Court—he was refused, both at the High Court and the Court of Appeal, although a practice statement issued by the Court of Appeal in 1986 indicated that they felt solicitors should be allowed to appear in front of the High Court and Court of appeal in formal proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Gatorade {{revealed}} the Gatorade Energy Bar in 2001. This bar was Gatorade's {{first foray into}} solid foods and was introduced to compete with PowerBar and Clif Bar. Gatorade Energy Bars contained {{a large proportion of}} protein, in addition to carbohydrates. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> primarily made up of puffed grains and corn syrup, common components of other energy bars. In 2001, Gatorade introduced the Gatorade Performance Series, a special line of sports nutrition products. These products include Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Drink, Gatorade Protein Recovery Shake, the Gatorade Nutrition Shake, and the Gatorade Nutrition Bar. The Endurance Formula, introduced in 2004, contained twice the sodium and three times the potassium of the typical Gatorade formula as well as chloride, magnesium and calcium, to better replace what athletes lose while training and competing.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 McFarlane {{was sentenced}} to life {{imprisonment}} in connection with the Bayardo Bar attack on Aberdeen Street in the Protestant Shankill Road district of Belfast, which killed five people (three men and two women) and injured 60 more on 13 August 1975. In a 1995 House of Lords debate, Gerry Fitt, the formerly Nationalist Party MP for West Belfast, alleged that McFarlane had machine-gunned three pedestrians who were passing by the Bayardo as it was blown up. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> <b>was</b> attacked because it was allegedly frequented by member of the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The IRA initially denied it had carried out the attack. The attack occurred against a background of severe sectarian violence. The IRA killed 88 Protestant civilians in similar attacks in 1974–76, in reprisal for loyalist attacks on Catholics, which killed 250 civilians in the same period.|$|E
