5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan swinging from a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby orangutan was painted over a nail on <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E
5|$|Amorium was {{strongly}} fortified and garrisoned, but a traitor revealed a weak spot in <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> the Abbasids concentrated their attack, effecting a breach. Unable {{to break through}} the besieging army, Boiditzes, the commander of the breached section privately attempted to negotiate with the Caliph without notifying his superiors. He concluded a local truce and left his post, which allowed the Arabs to take advantage, enter the city and capture it. Amorium was systematically destroyed, never to recover its former prosperity. Many of its inhabitants were slaughtered, and the remainder driven off as slaves. Most of the survivors were released after a truce in 841, but prominent officials were taken to the caliph's capital of Samarra and executed years later after refusing to convert to Islam, becoming known as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium.|$|E
5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> he had been standing moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays slipped inside and {{for about an hour}} an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E

5|$|Four {{sections}} of the Flodden Wall survive: {{to the north and}} south of the Grassmarket; in Greyfriars Kirkyard; and along Drummond Street and the Pleasance. North of the Grassmarket the wall runs alongside Granny's Green Steps and has been incorporated into later buildings, including the former Greyfriars Mission Kirk. A line of granite paving across the Grassmarket marks the line of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> it was uncovered during construction work in 2008. In the Vennel the last remaining bastion of the town walls survives. The Flodden Tower, as it is sometimes known, comprises two remaining walls with a total length of , pierced by crosslet gunloops and a 19th-century window. Sections of the Flodden Wall can be seen within Greyfriars Kirkyard, adorned with 16th and 17th century tombstones. At the junction of Forrest Road and Bristo Street a line of cobbles and a narrow gap in the later buildings mark the line of the wall. The longest section is in Drummond Street and the Pleasance, where it originally enclosed the Blackfriars Monastery. At the corner of the wall a blocked archway is probably the entrance to a demolished bastion. The site of the Netherbow is marked with an outline of brass blocks at the junction of the Royal Mile and St Mary's Street.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E
25|$|When {{a visitor}} looks upon the wall, {{his or her}} {{reflection}} can be seen simultaneously with the engraved names, which is meant to symbolically bring {{the past and present}} together. One wall points toward the Washington Monument, the other {{in the direction of the}} Lincoln Memorial, meeting at an angle of 125° 12′. Each wall has 72 panels, 70 listing names (numbered 1E through 70E and 70W through 1W) and two very small blank panels at the extremities. There is a pathway along the base of <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>where</b> visitors may walk.|$|E

King Tommen Baratheon, Joffrey's eight-year-old brother, now rules in King's Landing under his mother, Cersei Lannister. Brienne, the Maid of Tarth, is on a mission to find Sansa Stark, aided by Jaime Lannister. Sansa is hiding in the Vale, {{protected}} by Petyr Baelish, who has murdered his wife Lysa Arryn and named himself Protector of the Vale and guardian of eight-year-old Lord Robert Arryn.|$|E
25|$|Brockie {{was killed}} at Ypres in 1915, but a {{simmering}} controversy broke out between Churchill and Haldane {{until his death}} in 1950 as to the exact events of that night. Haldane claimed that the party had again agreed to defer their escape, but that Churchill had then gone over the wall by himself. Churchill's account describes him waiting behind the wall {{for more than an hour}} for the others to join him, and then a discussion between them through <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> the others told him the sentry was suspicious and they could not escape. Haldane agreed a conversation took place, but not how Churchill had come to be on the other side of the wall while they had not.|$|E
25|$|Inside the New House {{the downstairs}} {{consists}} of a main kitchen and a secondary kitchen (scullery) with pantry. It also includes a living room, although as the main room of the house, most meals would have been eaten in the main kitchen, equipped with an early range, boiler and hot air oven. Upstairs is a main bedroom and a second bedroom for children; to the rear (i.e. the colder, north side), are bedrooms for a servant and the servant lad respectively. Above the kitchen (for transferred warmth) is a grain and fleece store, with attached bacon loft, a narrow space behind <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> bacon or hams, usually salted first, would be hung to be smoked by the kitchen fire (entering through a small door in the chimney).|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the assault Muhammad b. 'Abdallah gathered his commanders together, and then sent men to the gates all along {{the western side of}} the city. The reinforcements engaged the Samarrans and, after killing a large number of them, forced them back to the gateways. Fighting continued until the late afternoon, with the defenders finally managing to expel the Samarrans from the gates and forcing them to flee back to their camp. The areas in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> the Samarrans had broken through were ordered repaired. The assault on {{the eastern side of the}} city also failed, as the Baghdadis were able to force the attackers back. As with the fighting on the western side, many Baghdadi and Samarran soldiers were killed in the battle for the Shammasiyyah Gate. The assault having therefore failed, the Samarrans returned to their siege positions.|$|E
25|$|The final assault {{began at}} 10:55 am on 31 August when James Leith's 5th Division rushed the main breach {{from the south}} while Thomas Bradford's Portuguese brigade stormed the smaller one from the east. After running the {{gauntlet}} of mines and small-arms fire, both columns reached the tops of their respective breaches and came under murderous fire. After enduring the one-sided slaughter for nearly 30 minutes, both columns retreated {{to the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> the troops hugged the ground to escape the intense fire. In this emergency, Graham ordered his siege guns to fire {{over the heads of the}} surviving attackers. This expedient saved the day for the Allies, as the fire ripped apart the inner defenses, inflicting heavy losses on the French. As some of the 5th Division managed to make progress, an accident set off a store of bombs, killing 60 Frenchmen and injuring many more.|$|E
25|$|Although shorter {{swords and}} daggers were used, the katana was {{probably}} the ninja's weapon of choice, and was sometimes carried on the back. The katana had several uses beyond normal combat. In dark places, the scabbard could be extended out of the sword, and used as a long probing device. The sword could also be laid against <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> the ninja could use the sword guard (tsuba) to gain a higher foothold. The katana could even {{be used as a}} device to stun enemies before attacking them, by putting a combination of red pepper, dirt or dust, and iron filings into the area {{near the top of the}} scabbard, so that as the sword was drawn the concoction would fly into the enemy's eyes, stunning him until a lethal blow could be made. While straight swords were used before the invention of the katana, the straight ninjatō has no historical precedent and is likely a modern invention.|$|E

25|$|Round towers – The use {{of round}} towers as wall towers is {{probably}} contemporary with rectangle towers {{and may be}} mixed with rectangle towers as at St Pölten. There are many 'stadt' with right angle corners to <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>where</b> round towers are used.|$|R

500|$|Apart from a brief {{encounter}} between Waters and Barrett in Harrods {{a couple of}} years later (during which, when Barrett saw Waters, he ran outside, dropping his bags full of sweets in the process), this was the last time any member of Pink Floyd saw him. A reflection on the day appears in Nick Mason's book [...] A reference to this reunion also appears in the film <b>The</b> <b>Wall,</b> <b>where</b> the character Pink, played by Bob Geldof, shaves his body hair after having a mental breakdown, just as Barrett had.|$|E
500|$|After riders have boarded and {{the station}} floor is retracted, Superman: Krypton Coaster departs with {{a left turn}} out of the station. This leads {{directly}} to the [...] chain lift hill. At the top, the train crests the lift hill and follows a fairly level 180 degree turn to the right above the quarry wall. This leads into a [...] drop off the quarry wall directly into the [...] vertical loop. With the quarry wall on the track's right, the train inclines {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> it performs a helix to the right. After dropping from the quarry wall again, the train enters the zero-g roll where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness. This is followed by the [...] cobra roll and a mid-course brake run. The exit from the mid-course brake run banks down to the right into the two interlocking corkscrews. This leads to a final turn before the final brake run and return to the station.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 September 1944 {{an attempt}} to kill a German soldier {{was made by the}} French Resistance in Rosendäel. The house that the assailant fled to was {{surrounded}} and the occupants arrested. All eight were held at the Fort des Dunes, except for Daniel Decroos, who had been killed while trying to escape. Another detainee had been wounded by an exploding grenade. On 6 September six detainees were executed by firing squad in the north ditch and the wounded detainee was euthanized. The seven were buried next to the ramparts. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> the prisoners had been shot was destroyed and collapsed on the graves. Following the Liberation the execution was investigated and the graves discovered. [...] The remains were exhumed and reinterred.|$|E
2500|$|Lining the {{perimeter}} walls to Brookes Street and Gregory Terrace are horse stables. The stables are in long timber buildings with skillion roofs clad with corrugated iron. The buildings comprise {{back to back}} stalls and are arranged with narrow [...] "lanes" [...] between them. The holding capacity must be well over a hundred horses and the individual accommodation is fairly standard – each has a concrete floor, single door and window space filled with a metal grille. The concrete has been roughed up by stamping a rough lattice pattern into it over most areas. There is a horse washing area against <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> the floor is rough concrete and pebble and the bays are divided by vertical corrugated metal panels.|$|E
2500|$|Sumner's {{original}} order {{called for}} the division of Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock to support French and Hancock sent forward his brigade under Col. Samuel K. Zook behind Palmer's. They met a similar fate. Next was his Irish Brigade under Brig. Gen. Thomas F. Meagher. By coincidence, they attacked the area defended by fellow Irishmen of Col. Robert McMillan's 24th Georgia Infantry. One Confederate who spotted the green regimental flags approaching cried out, [...] "Oh God, what a pity! Here comes Meagher's fellows." [...] But McMillan exhorted his troops: [...] "Give it to them now, boys! Now's the time! Give it to them!" [...] Hancock's final brigade was led by Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell. Leading his two regiments on the left, Col. Nelson A. Miles suggested to Caldwell {{that the practice of}} marching in formation, firing, and stopping to reload, made the Union soldiers easy targets, and that a concerted bayonet charge might be effective in carrying the works. Caldwell denied permission. Miles was struck by a bullet in the throat as he led his men to within 40 yards of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> they were pinned down as their predecessors had been. Caldwell himself was soon struck by two bullets and put out of action.|$|E
