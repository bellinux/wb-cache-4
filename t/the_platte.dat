5|$|In Nebraska, a {{small number}} of pallid {{sturgeon}} have been captured along the lower reaches of <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than <b>the</b> <b>Platte,</b> between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|When the Southern Pawnees {{arrived in}} Nebraska, the Skidis were not {{pleased to see}} them on lands that they {{regarded}} as their own. Nevertheless, they were willing to accept them as neighbors, so long as they kept to the south side of <b>the</b> <b>Platte.</b> However, the Chaui leaders demanded that they be recognized as the heads of the entire Pawnee people, above the Skidi chiefs. They defied the Skidis by sending a large hunting party to Prairie Creek, {{on the north side of}} <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> within sight of the Skidi villages on the Loup. The Skidis responded by attacking the Chaui hunters and driving them back across <b>the</b> <b>Platte.</b> The Chauis and Pitahawiratas resolved on war, and summoned the Kitkehahki fighters to join them against the Skidis; the Kitkehahkis, unwilling to leave their people unprotected against Skidi raids, left the Republican and moved to <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> near the other bands.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> South <b>Platte</b> River {{has been}} dammed about 20 times for water storage, {{drinking}} water and irrigation purposes in Colorado as it flows to its confluence with <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> River. <b>The</b> total number of dams in <b>the</b> South <b>Platte</b> drainage may exceed 1,000 as nearly all major streams {{have at least one}} dam on them. <b>The</b> South <b>Platte</b> River serves as the principal source of water for arid eastern Colorado. <b>The</b> South <b>Platte</b> River valley provided a major emigration path to Denver. The wagon trails followed the south side of <b>the</b> Platte/North <b>Platte</b> River.

5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition reached <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> in 1804, {{they found}} the Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They {{were told that the}} band had {{returned}} to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between 1777 and 1785, the Kitkehahkis again {{abandoned}} and then re-occupied the Republican valley. A Spanish account of 1785 describes a {{village on the}} south side of <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> in Butler County, not far from the modern town of Linwood, Nebraska; this village was occupied by the Kitkehahkis until about 1785, when they returned to the Republican.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Pawnee people were not a single unified tribe. At {{the middle of the}} 18th century, they consisted of two major groups. The Skidis, or Wolf Pawnees, had migrated northward with the Arikaras, and had probably been in Nebraska since 1600 or earlier. By the beginning of the 18th century, they were established on the Loup River, which flows through central Nebraska into <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> River from the north.|$|E

40|$|An ichthyological survey (1989 - 1995) of 31 {{sites on}} <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> and South Platte rivers and {{immediately}} below <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> diversion dam (junction of <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> and South Platte rivers) {{resulted in the}} captures and distributional documentation of 46 species of fishes. Four other species, found in the drainage, were captured in tributary streams only. Preserved voucher records are based on 49 sampling visits (1989 - 1995) to the 32 localities (approximately 55, 000 specimens). An additional 42, 000 nonvouchered specimens were taken, identified, and released at 17 of the localities (1980 - 1995). Above Lake McConaughy, <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> River is dominated by five species (Cyprinella lutrensis, Hybognathus hankinsoni, H. placitus, Hybopsis dorsalis, and Notropis ludibundus), whereas below Lake McConaughy the fish fauna is dominated by only four species (Catostomus commersoni, Cyprinella lutrensis, Hybopsis dorsalis, and Notropis ludibundus). <b>The</b> South <b>Platte</b> fish fauna is dominated by six species (Cyprinella lutrensis, Hybopsis dorsalis, Notropis ludibundus, Pimephales promelas, Semotilus atromaculatus, and Fundulus zebrinus). The two units on <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> River are each divisible into eastern and western sections, based on the compositions of the fish faunas. The eastern and western divisions are attributed to effects of the impoundment of <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> River by Lake McConaughy. Recent (1995) work on <b>the</b> South <b>Platte</b> River also suggests the existence of eastern and western subdivisions, but those subdivisions were not evident 10 - 20 yr ago. Including nonvouchered records obtained by ichthyology classes, the twelve sites on <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> River above Lake McConaughy harbor 15 - 29 species of fishes (39 species taken in total), whereas the eight sites on <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> River below Lake McConaughy harbor 17 - 29 species (34 species taken in total) and the twelve sites on <b>the</b> South <b>Platte</b> River harbor 19 - 33 species (37 species taken in total) ...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Platte</b> Canyon High School {{hostage crisis}} was a hostage taking and {{shooting}} at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, on September 27, 2006. The gunman, 53-year-old Duane Roger Morrison, took six female students hostage and sexually assaulted them, later releasing four. When police broke open the classroom's door with explosives, Morrison opened {{fire with a}} semi-automatic pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head. The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed, and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had committed suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom. Keyes was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. MDT (23:32 UTC) at Saint Anthony's Hospital in Denver, Colorado after undergoing emergency surgery.|$|E
5|$|There is no firm {{documentary}} evidence of {{occupation of the}} Webster County village after 1809. However, analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that the site was re-occupied during the second decade of the 19th century; and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that the Kitkehahki were living on the Republican. By 1833, however, the village had been abandoned and the band was living on the Loup River. In that year, the four Pawnee bands, treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government, signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of <b>the</b> <b>Platte.</b>|$|E

5|$|Whether the Republican valley was {{abandoned}} after the Omaha attack is not recorded. The invading Omahas had camped on <b>the</b> <b>Platte,</b> undisturbed by the Chauis, {{on their way}} to the Kitkehahkis; this might indicate that the two Pawnee bands were on bad terms at the time. The power of the Omahas was broken soon thereafter: in about 1801, a smallpox epidemic spread from the Skidis to the Omahas, killing half of the tribe, Blackbird among them.|$|E
5|$|Young {{reviewed}} {{information on}} the Great Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulted with mountain men and trappers, and met with Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit missionary familiar with the region.

A new route {{on the north side}} of <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> and North Platte rivers was chosen to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access, and campsites with travelers using the established Oregon Trail on the river’s south side.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado River basin shares {{drainage}} boundaries {{with many}} other major watersheds of North America.

50|$|Starting at the {{terminus}} of {{the railroad}} in Atchison, the Overland Trail paralleled the other emigrant trails on <b>the</b> Great <b>Platte</b> River Road along <b>the</b> North <b>Platte</b> River in Kansas and Nebraska. At Julesburg, Colorado, the trail splits from the others and continues along <b>the</b> South <b>Platte</b> River. Following <b>the</b> same general path that miners used during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, the trail follows <b>the</b> South <b>Platte</b> through <b>the</b> present day towns of Sterling, Fort Morgan and to Latham, the last station on <b>the</b> South <b>Platte.</b> Located near <b>the</b> present day city of Greeley, Latham was an important stage stop and junction joining the Overland Trail and a short spur connecting the trail to Denver and the surrounding mining towns. From Latham the stage route crosses <b>the</b> South <b>Platte</b> to Laporte and strikes the well established Cherokee Trail going north into Wyoming. In 1862, the Fort Morgan Cut-Off was established between Fort Morgan and Denver saving three days and 40 mi from the previous route and cutting off stations between Fort Morgan and Latham.|$|R
5|$|The Missouri was {{the reason}} Omaha was founded, and {{continued}} to be important to the city's growth for many years. In 1853 William D. Brown had the first vision for the city, leading him to found the Lone Tree Ferry crossing the Missouri River from Council Bluffs, Iowa. Later the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company hired Alfred D. Jones to plat Omaha City, which {{was among the first}} settlements in the Nebraska Territory. Along with the Lone Tree Ferry Landing in Downtown Omaha, other ferries were established in the Omaha area at Florence, Saratoga and Bellevue. Large steamboats would carry provisions up the Missouri from St. Louis, stocking the warehouses in Jobbers Canyon and loading the trains of the Union Pacific and at the Omaha Quartermaster Depot, which in turn supplied the U.S. Army's Department of <b>the</b> <b>Platte.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} route also {{follows the}} river {{along the edge}} of the Laramie Mountains to an area near the current towns of Casper and Glenrock. In 1847, during the first Mormon emigration, Brigham Young established a ferry near present-day Casper known as Mormon Ferry. The next year the ferry was moved a few miles downriver. The ferry was free for Latter Day Saints, but charged a toll for other users. The ferry was manned by groups of Mormons every summer from 1848 until 1852. In 1853 John Baptiste Richard built a toll bridge near the ferry site, which would eventually put all ferries on the North Platte out of business. In 1859, Louis Guinard built <b>the</b> <b>Platte</b> Bridge near the site of the original Mormon Ferry. Guinard also built a trading post at one end of the bridge which eventually became Fort Caspar.|$|E
