40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) No. 2015 / 848 {{on insolvency proceedings}} (recast) as concerns the coordination among insolvency proceedings. The recast Regulation {{on the one hand}} maintains the general framework of the pre-existing Regulation (EC) No. 1346 / 2000, based on the co-existence of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> to be opened in the Member State where the debtor possesses the centre of his main interests (COMI), and secondary insolvency proceeedings, which may be opened in another Member State where the debtor possesses an establishment, with effects limited to the debtor’s assets present within that Member State. On the other hand, the recast Regulation introduces a series of amendments, inspired to the objective of securing the prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> insolvency proceeedings. These amndments tend to favour the concentration within <b>the</b> <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> of <b>the</b> whole of the operations inherent in the disposal of the insolvency of the debtor, so as to reduce as far as possible the need for secondary insolvency proceedings to be opened in another Member State. This aim is concretely pursued by granting extensive powers to the administrator of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> among which, the power of undertaking to apply, as concerns the protection of creditors’ rights in respect of assets located in a Member State where secondary insolvency proceedings could have been opened, the same law as would have applied in case such proceedings were opened (s. c. “synthetic” or “virtual” secondary insolvency proceedings). The recast Regulation contains also express provisions dealing with jurisdiction on actions directly deriving from insolvency proceedings and closely linked with them, favouring their joinder, either before the courts of the Member State competent for the insolvency proceedings as such, or before the courts competent for other actions in civil and commercial matters to which they may be related. The new Regulation refrains instead from regulating the relationships between the insolvency proceedings and pending lawsuits or arbitral proceedings concerning assets of the debtor, which are left for domestic law to regulate, thereby exposing the uniformity in the application of the Regulation to the risk inherent in the differences among Member States’ laws on the subject. Furthermore, reflecting a traditional, strictly inter partes approach, the new Regulation, unlike the Brussels I recast Regulation, falls short of addressing the problems of coordination which might arise with proceedings pending before third country courts...|$|R
40|$|This thesis focuses {{primarily}} {{on the field of}} European cross-border insolvency law, currently represented by the EU Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (EC No 1346 / 2000). The EU Regulation considered theoretical conflict between advocates of universalism and territorialism, and is generally regarded as reflecting it in a way of modification, which is represented by distinction between main and ancillary insolvency proceedings. Determination of international jurisdiction in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> is inherently linked with the criteria of <b>the</b> centre of <b>main</b> interests (COMI), which serves as a specific connecting factor to constitute both the court with jurisdiction and applicable law, for the purpose of the whole insolvency process in accordance with the principle lex fori concursus. The COMI concept is the root of the jurisdiction trouble, thus this thesis aims at providing substantial information on the concept, since the EU Regulation neglects its proper introduction. One of many issues related to COMI conception is a phenomenon of forum shopping, term used to describe situations when debtors manipulate with facts relevant for establishing jurisdiction, in order to obtain more favourable position, usually at creditors' expense.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the admissibility of {{the right}} to counsel of the accused in the English criminal trial, and focuses on the pre-trial stage and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> in <b>the</b> 13 th and 14 th centuries. Although the pre-trial proceedings had not been formalised until the mid 16 th century, there are still some data available on which an opinion may be based. The author’s focus of attention is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> criminal proceeding and the admissibility {{of the right}} to counsel at that stage, for which the sources of information seem more reliable. As can be deduced, the right to counsel depended on the form in which the criminal proceeding commenced and the weight, or gravity of the crime. In most serious cases the right to counsel was restricted. However, it was probably not until the Tudor period when the rule against defence counsel considerably toughened. This is further evidenced by instances occurring between 1300 and 1500 in which legal aid was extended in cases tried on indictment. An exception were matters initiated by private accusation, so called appeal of felony, and offences of lesser gravity, called misdemeanours. Legal issues that emerged during a criminal trial were also capable of justifying the right to counsel...|$|R

[...] He stated that [...] "several hundred" [...] death {{sentences}} have been pronounced by the state court. In 60% of cases, the death penalty had been pronounced, in other cases, a perpetual KZ-briefing. [...] "An acquittal was virtually eliminated. In my days, there was no innocent, [...] "said Thümmler in his testimony. [...] "We asked the accused if they agree, and they all said yes, yes." [...] The Court consisted of him as chairman and one representative of the Judicial Police and the SD as assessor. As a defender, an official of his department had acted when - what was rarely happened - the accused had requested for a defender. He had determined {{the composition of the}} court and the person of the prosecutor and the defense. According to the findings of the court, it was with the accused to civilians who had been arrested by the Gestapo in Katowice. The arrests were made for alleged resistance activities and criminal activities such as smuggling, courier services or listening to enemy broadcasts. The trial lasted rarely longer than two minutes; basis of the judgments were the previous [...] "confessions" [...] of the defendants. As a witness in Frankfurt, Thümmler told that he had not heard or known whether the [...] "confessions" [...] were made in [...] "rigorous interrogations". Such interrogation methods by the Gestapo were associated with abuse.Investigation against Thümmler did not lead to a conviction: 1970 rejected the district court Ellwangen <b>the</b> opening of <b>main</b> <b>proceedings</b> from.

40|$|A {{guarantee}} {{for real}} ensuring of defendant’s rights is the qualified legal assistance {{by the side}} of the lawyer, chosen or assigned by the proceeding body. Providing legal protection to defendants was an important achievement in the long and difficult efforts to democratize the criminal proceedings. It was initially achieved in developed countries which promulgated the fundamental rights and freedoms and on this basis the major laws of activity of justice’s bodies were enforced. The role of lawyer in the criminal proceeding gradually increased and became an important factor in the fight against violations of law and injustice.  The lawyer became a respected procedural figure, standing in front of prosecution, as the opposing party able to develop a cross-examination and to influence in a fair solution of case. However in practice, it is not rare the violation of rights of defendants by proceeding organs. So, it is right to make this question: What will be done with their rights and how will they be protected? In practice there were different opinions in terms of guaranteeing the rights of these defendants and how far the rights of lawyers of the defendants are extended. This is the reason why this paper will bring in attention the position, procedural guarantees of lawyers, the actions that can take and the exercise of their main rights in defending the interest of defendant, taking into account <b>the</b> <b>main</b> phases of criminal <b>proceedings.</b>  Special attention will be devoted to case law of European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in terms of guaranteeing the rights of defendants, the orientations of the Albanian Constitutional Court and that of Supreme Court. At the end, this paper will reach in some conclusions through which proposals and amendments will be made to the code of criminal procedure, starting from the principle that the rights and procedural guarantees of defendants should be guaranteed at the maximum, because it’s the only way to achieve the highest degree of democratization of the criminal proceedings...|$|R

5000|$|... 17 October 1995. The {{following}} {{judgment was}} delivered {{in open court}} in Luxembourg.1 By order of 22 June 1993, received at the court on 23 November 1993, the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court) referred to the court for a preliminary ruling under article 177 of the E.E.C. Treaty two questions on the interpretation of article 2(1) and (4) of Council Directive (76/207/E.E.C.) of 9 February 1976 on {{the implementation of the}} principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.2 Those questions were raised in proceedings between the plaintiff, Mr. Kalanke, and Freie Hansestadt Bremen (City of Bremen).3 Paragraph 4 of the Landesgleichstellungsgesetz of 20 November 1990 (“L.G.G.;” the Bremen Law on Equal Treatment for Men and Women in the Public Service) (Bremisches Gesetzblatt, p. 433) provides:“Appointment, assignment to an official post and promotion“(1) In the case of an appointment (including establishment as a civil servant or judge) which is not made for training purposes, women who have the same qualifications as men applying for the same post are to be given priority in sectors where they are under-represented.(2) In the case of an assignment to a position in a higher pay, remuneration and salary bracket, women who have the same qualifications as men applying for the same post are to be given priority if they are under-represented. This also applies in the case of assignment to a different official post and promotion …(4) Qualifications are to be evaluated exclusively in accordance with the requirements of the occupation, post to be filled or career bracket. Specific experience and capabilities, such as those acquired as a result of family work, social commitment or unpaid activity, are part of the qualifications within the meaning of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) if they are of use in performing the duties of the position in question.(5) There is under-representation if women do not make up {{at least half of the}} staff in the individual pay, remuneration and salary brackets in the relevant personnel group within a department. This also applies to the function levels provided for in the organisation chart.”4 It appears from the order for reference that, at the final stage of recruitment to a post of section manager in the Bremen parks department, two candidates, both in B.A.T. pay bracket III (see ante, p. 317G-H), were shortlisted: the plaintiff, the holder of a diploma in horticulture and landscape gardening, who had worked since 1973 as a horticultural employee in the parks department and acted as permanent assistant to the section manager; and Mrs. Glissmann, holder of a diploma in landscape gardening since 1983 and also employed, since 1975, as a horticultural employee in the parks department.5 The staff committee refused to give its consent to the plaintiff's promotion, proposed by the parks department management. Reference to arbitration resulted in a recommendation in favour of the plaintiff. The staff committee then stated that the arbitration had failed and appealed to *330 the conciliation board which, in a decision binding on the employer, considered that the two candidates were equally qualified and that priority should therefore be given, in accordance with the L.G.G., to the woman.6 Before the Arbeitsgericht (Labour Court), the plaintiff claimed that he was better qualified than Mrs. Glissmann, a fact which the conciliation board had failed to recognise. He argued that, by reason of its quota system, the L.G.G. was incompatible with the Bremen Constitution, with the Grundgesetz (German Basic Law) and with paragraph 611a of the B.G.B. (German Civil Code). His application was dismissed, however, by the Arbeitsgericht and again, on appeal, by the Landesarbeitsgericht (Regional Labour Court).7 The first chamber of the Bundesarbeitsgericht, hearing the plaintiff's application for review on a point of law, considers that resolution of the dispute depends essentially on the applicability of the L.G.G. It points out that, if the conciliation board was wrong in applying that Law, its decision would be unlawful because it gave an advantage, solely on the ground of sex, to an equally qualified female candidate. The Bundesarbeitsgericht accepts the Landesarbeitsgericht's finding that the two applicants were equally qualified for the post. Considering itself bound also by that court's finding that women are under-represented in the parks department, it holds that the conciliation board was obliged, under paragraph 4(2) of the L.G.G., to refuse to agree to the plaintiff's appointment to the vacant post.8 The Bundesarbeitsgericht points out that the case does not involve a system of strict quotas reserving a certain proportion of posts for women, regardless of their qualifications, but rather a system of quotas dependent on candidates' abilities. Women enjoy no priority unless the candidates of both sexes are equally qualified.9 The national court considers that the quota system is compatible with the German constitutional and statutory provisions referred to in paragraph 6 above. More specifically, it points out that paragraph 4 of the L.G.G. must be interpreted in accordance with the Grundgesetz with the effect that, even if priority for promotion is to be given in principle to women, exceptions must be made in appropriate cases.10 It notes a number of factors suggesting that such a system is not incompatible with Directive (76/207/E.E.C.).11 Considering, however, that doubts remain in that regard, the Bundesarbeitsgericht has stayed the proceedings and sought a preliminary ruling from the court on the following questions:“(1) Must article 2(4) of Council Directive (76/207/E.E.C.) be interpreted as also covering statutory provisions under which, when a position in a higher pay bracket is being assigned, women with the same qualifications as men applying for the same position are to be given priority if women are under-represented, there being deemed to be under-representation if women do not make up at least half of the staff in the individual pay brackets in the relevant personnel group within a department, which also applies to the function levels provided for in the organisation chart?“(2) If question (1) is answered in the negative, must article 2(1) of Council Directive (76/207/E.E.C.) be interpreted, having regard to *331 the principle of proportionality, as meaning that it is not permissible to apply statutory provisions under which, when a position in a higher pay bracket is being assigned, women with the same qualifications as men applying for the same position are to be given priority if women are under-represented, there being deemed to be under-representation if women do not make up at least half of the staff in the individual pay brackets in the relevant personnel group within a department, which also applies to the function levels provided for in the organisation chart?”12 Both questions seek to clarify the scope of the derogation from the principle of equal treatment allowed by article 2(4) of Directive (76/207/E.E.C.) and should therefore be examined together.13 The national court asks, essentially, whether article 2(1) and (4) of Directive (76/207/E.E.C.) precludes national rules such as those in the present case which, where candidates of different sexes shortlisted for promotion are equally qualified, automatically give priority to women in sectors where they are under-represented, under-representation being deemed to exist when women do not make up at least half of the staff in the individual pay brackets in the relevant personnel group or in the function levels provided for in the organisation chart.14 In its order for reference, the national court points out that a quota system such as that in issue may help to overcome in the future the disadvantages which women currently face and which perpetuate past inequalities, inasmuch as it accustoms people to seeing women also filling certain more senior posts. The traditional assignment of certain tasks to women and the concentration of women at the lower end of the scale are contrary to the equal rights criteria applicable today. In that connection, the national court cites figures illustrating the low proportion of women in the higher career brackets among city employees in Bremen, particularly if sectors such as education, where the presence of women in higher posts is now established, are excluded.15 The purpose of Directive (76/207/E.E.C.) is, as stated in article 1(1), to put into effect in the member states the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards, inter alia, access to employment, including promotion. Article 2(1) states that the principle of equal treatment means that “there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex either directly or indirectly.”16 A national rule that, where men and women who are candidates for the same promotion are equally qualified, women are automatically to be given priority in sectors where they are under-represented involves discrimination on grounds of sex.17 It must, however, be considered whether such a national rule is permissible under article 2(4), which provides that Directive (76/207/E.E.C.):“shall be without prejudice to measures to promote equal opportunity for men and women, in particular by removing existing inequalities which affect women's opportunities …”18 That provision is specifically and exclusively designed to allow measures which, although discriminatory in appearance, are in fact *332 intended to eliminate or reduce actual instances of inequality which may exist in the reality of social life: see Commission of the European Communities v. French Republic (Case 312/86) 1988 E.C.R. 6315, 6336, para. 15.19 It thus permits national measures relating to access to employment, including promotion, which give a specific advantage to women with a view to improving their ability to compete on the labour market and to pursue a career on an equal footing with men.20 As the Council considered in the third recital in the preamble to Recommendation (84/635/E.E.C.) of 13 December 1984 on the promotion of positive action for women:“existing legal provisions on equal treatment, which are designed to afford rights to individuals, are inadequate for the elimination of all existing inequalities unless parallel action is taken by governments, both sides of industry and other bodies concerned, to counteract the prejudicial effects on women in employment which arise from social attitudes, behaviour and structures; …”21 Nevertheless, as a derogation from an individual right laid down in Directive (76/207/E.E.C.), article 2(4) must be interpreted strictly: see Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Case 222/84) 1987 I.C.R. 83, 104, para. 36.22 National rules which guarantee women absolute and unconditional priority for appointment or promotion go beyond promoting equal opportunities and overstep the limits of the exception in article 2(4) of Directive (76/207/E.E.C.).23 Furthermore, in so far as it seeks to achieve equal representation of men and women in all grades and levels within a department, such a system substitutes for equality of opportunity as envisaged in article 2(4) the result which is only to be arrived at by providing such equality of opportunity.24 The answer to the national court's questions must therefore be that article 2(1) and (4) of Directive (76/207/E.E.C.) precludes national rules such as those in the present case which, where candidates of different sexes shortlisted for promotion are equally qualified, automatically give priority to women in sectors where they are under-represented, under-representation being deemed to exist when women do not make up at least half of the staff in the individual pay brackets in the relevant personnel group or in the function levels provided for in the organisation chart.Costs25 The costs incurred by the United Kingdom and the Commission of the European Communities, which have submitted observations to the court, are not recoverable.

The approximated task could be resolved through learning the supervised classifier with a composed word embeddings of two posts. Considering that the success in this task could be quite sensitive to the choice of word representations, we propose a comparison of the performance of different word embedding models. We train 7 models (Word 2 Vec, Glove, Word 2 Vec-f, Wang 2 Vec, AdaGram, FastText, Swivel), evaluate embeddings produced by them on dataset of human judgements and compare their performance on the task of non-relevant posts detection. To make the comparison, we propose a dataset of semantic relatedness with posts from {{one of the most popular}} Russian Web forums, imageboard " 2 ch", which has challenging lexical and grammatical features.
