40|$|The Project {{is aimed}} at {{designing}} a wind turbine that can {{be able to build}} by Laypersons, using readily available material which is feasible & affordable to provide much needed electricity. Since most of the high wind power density regions in the zone of high wind speed are already being tapped by large scale wind turbine and so it required creating a large scope for the development of low wind speed turbines. Our study focuses primarily on designing the blade for <b>tapping</b> <b>power</b> in the regions of low wind power density. The aerodynamic profiles of wind turbine blades have major influence on aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbine. This can be achieved by comparing the effectiveness of a crude blade fashioned from a different Size, Material & standard of PVC drainage pipe which are easily available in market. It can be evaluated by performing experimental analysis, data collection & its evaluation on different type & size of PVC Pipe & preparing an analytical tool for best Design...|$|E

The tapping stations are to be of small power ratings so that it will not interfere with the main control and stability of the HVDC network.

This paper therefore proposes a simple analytical technique used to determine <b>power</b> <b>tapping</b> limit on DC-link of a VSC HVDC network. Effect of <b>power</b> <b>tapping</b> below and above the analytical tap limit is illustrated by results from simulation carried out in Matlab/Simulink, hence validating the proposed technique...|$|R
