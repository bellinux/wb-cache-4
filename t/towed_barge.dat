50|$|When boat electrofishing, {{the boat}} {{itself is the}} cathode, and the anode(s) are {{generally}} mounted off the bow. The stunned fish swim toward the anode, where they are caught alive using a dip net. <b>Towed</b> <b>barge</b> electrofishers operate similarly to backpack electrofishers, with the exception that the generator is located on a floating barge instead of on a backpack. Often the barge can be left stationary on the shore and longer cathodes and anodes allow the crew to sample large areas. Barge electrofishers often employ gas-powered generators since a user {{does not have to}} carry the extra weight on his or her back.|$|E
5000|$|On February 1, 1937 Cecil Francis Kelly {{was awarded}} the Empire Gallantry Medal (gazetted February 5, 1937) for his actions in May 1936. This medal was awarded to Kelly {{alongside}} Inspector George Adamson. His citation reads:In May of 1936, with Mr. Kelly as pilot, Inspector Adamson {{was in charge of}} two Port Police launches escorting a cargo of defective dynamite, which was being taken for destruction up the Hooghly River in a <b>towed</b> <b>barge.</b> The barge proved quite unseaworthy, and after a journey of about 15 miles up the river, was sinking. Inspector Adamson and his assistants had no responsibility except for escorting the cargo, but in spite of this they tried at great personal risk to keep the barge afloat by bailing from 7:00 pm until midnight, when it was found necessary to beach the barge on the bank near a large jute mill. In spite of the dynamite exuding nitroglycerine, Inspector Adamson and his two sergeants worked indefatigably in the water and in the dark to help guide the barge ashore by hand. The beaching took five-and-a-half hours. The barge was partially unloaded, but it was too dangerous to remove the two tons at the bottom, so the barge had to be re-floated, towed into deep water, and sunk. Inspector Adamson rendered great assistance during the whole operation, and stood by in a police launch despite the grave danger. Mr. Kelly supervised the handling of the barge throughout, and without his skilled assistance the feat could not have been accomplished. A small accident, such as the striking of a bootsole nail on a stone in the river bank, the [...] " [...] working [...] " [...] of the hull of the barge when she was subsequently towed off, or a slip with any of the gear used, would have resulted in nearly certain death to those working, and a disaster of the first magnitude to the surrounding mills. Though it was not his duty as pilot, Mr. Kelly remained in the barge while it was towed off the beach and until it was safely sunk, supervising its handling in the current by the two launches. Both men displayed cool, deliberate, and sustained gallantry for many hours under conditions of the greatest strain.|$|E

40|$|Smolt {{predation}} in {{the vicinity}} of Yaquina and Coos bays, Oregon, by one bird species, the common murre Uria aalge, appears to be very high. One strategy to reduce mortality of salmon smolts is to transport them in a vehicle for release offshore where predators are less likely to concentrate. Offshore releases of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in Sweden and Norway yielded consistently higher returns than onshore releases. Preliminary results with offshore release of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha in Oregon are mixed, but handling and transport methods are suspected {{to play an important role}} in survival of smolts released offshore. Smolts released offshore from a towed net pen exhibited a much higher return rate than smolts released from a tank aboard a fishing vessel or from a <b>towed</b> <b>barge.</b> Straying was less of a problem when smolts were released from a towed net pen in comparison with a <b>towed</b> <b>barge</b> or deck tank...|$|E

In our paper we shall analyze the effects induced by some recently used skegs and examine {{the connection between the}} parameters depending upon the towing resistance and the {{dynamic stability}}; moreover our investigation shall examine some unusual stern shapes.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} investigation {{on the effect}} of different tow rope lengths and arrangements for a towed ship in calm water by using the experimental model conducted at Marine Technology Centre, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Three variations of tow rope arrangements were tested in the experiment: Straighttow, V-tow and Kite-tow. A total of fourteen types of tow rope arrangements were tested at a constant speed of 0. 5 m/s and a rake-barge were captured via Qualysis Track Manager (QTM) „Image Processing Techniques?. From the experiment, it was observed that for Straight-tow, the tow rope length increment was proportional to the oscillation where for every increment of Lv length (length of tow rope in V shape arrangement) reduced the oscillations by around 12 %. Kite-tow arrangement design offered a better safety towing system and has nearly zero sway motion but large water width due to the drift distance from the tow point which is around 0. 64 and 1. 1 times barge length. The result from Straight-tow with different skegs arrangement s showed significant improvement in reducing the sway motion pf the <b>towed</b> <b>barge.</b> Similarly, V-tow barge with different skegs arrangements also presented a substantial improvement in decreasing the amount of sway motion. In the final part of the research, computer simulation using FORTRAN program and codes from Yasukawa & Fitriadhy (2010) were carried out and the results were compared with the experimental model of Straight-tow barge. Computer simulations and model experiment results showed less than 10 % deviation in sway motions...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{model of the}} locks system on the Illinois Waterway is described. The model was developed using ProModel for Windows and includes boats and <b>barge</b> <b>tows</b> traveling through the locks system and operation of the locks.

The handling of both boats and <b>barge</b> <b>tows</b> in the locks greatly complicates the simulation model, since their differences in size is significant.
