25|$|Free workers also earn {{compensating}} differentials, whereby <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> {{more for}} doing unpleasant work. Neither sustenance nor enforcement costs rise with the unpleasantness of the work, however, so slaves' costs do not rise {{by the same}} amount. As such, slaves are more attractive for unpleasant work, and less for pleasant work. Because the unpleasantness {{of the work is}} not internalised, being born by the slave rather than the owner, it is a negative externality and leads to over-use of slaves in these situations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of firefighter: wholetime and retained. Wholetime firefighters work {{full-time}} in the fire service. Retained firefighters are on call for long periods (at least 70 hours a week) to respond to incidents. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> a salary for the time they spend on call and a greater amount for each incident they respond to, on average 2 or 3 per week. Many have jobs outside of the fire service. Large town fire stations have wholetime crews, while small rural ones are usually staffed only by retained firefighters. Voluntary firefighters are now rare: the only voluntary units now in operation are the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit (near Aberystwyth, Wales).|$|E

25|$|A 2012 International Monetary Fund study {{concluded}} that the US financial sector has grown so large that it is slowing economic growth. New York University economist Thomas Philippon supported those findings, estimating that the US spends $300 billion too much on financial services per year, and that the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of Chicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers {{in research and development}} add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry workers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 for every dollar <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paid.</b> A study by the Bank for International Settlements reached similar conclusions, saying the finance industry impedes economic growth and research and development based industries.|$|E
25|$|For local {{government}} purposes, Scotland {{is divided into}} 32 council areas, with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000people. Local councils {{are made up of}} elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a Provost, or Convenor, to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area. Councillors are subject to a code of conduct enforced by the Standards Commission for Scotland. The representative association of Scotland's local authorities is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA).|$|E

Ron later singed his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In Order of the Phoenix, Lee Jordan is punished by Dolores Umbridge for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, {{as one of her}} Educational Decrees states that teachers can only talk to students about the subjects <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> to teach. In Cursed Child Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of Chamber of Secrets and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).|$|E

Baby brings her father to help Penny, but when Jake asks point blank, [...] "Who's responsible for this girl?", Johnny replies [...] "I am", claiming responsibility out of fear that Penny will be fired if it gets out that she slept with Robbie. Jake treats Penny, but is angry that Baby used his money to pay for the procedure, and forbids Baby to associate with Johnny or his friends. Baby goes to Johnny to apologize for her father's behavior. They dance, and afterwards have sex. Jake tells his family they'll be leaving early over breakfast. Marjorie says <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> up til Sunday and Lisa protests, because she wants to sing at the end-of-season talent show. Jake gives in, and Baby continues to see Johnny despite her father's warning. She pulls Johnny off the footpath when her father is nearby, and Johnny is hurt that she won't stand up for him to her father. Robbie sees them during their argument and makes a derisive remark about [...] "going slumming" [...] with the staff. Johnny assaults him.|$|E
