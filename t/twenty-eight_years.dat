5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, <b>twenty-eight</b> <b>years</b> earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy {{for a walk in}} a perambulator (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E

25|$|Up to 25% of {{military}} burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.

During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of <b>twenty-eight</b> <b>years</b> when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.|$|E

25|$|At age forty-six, Digby {{traveled}} to the Middle East, {{and fell in love}} with Sheik Abdul Medjuel el Mezrab (also known as Sheikh Mijwal Al Mezrab in accounts by contemporary Western travellers in Syria). Medjuel was a sheik of the Mezrab section of the Sba'a, a well-known sub-tribe of the great 'Anizzah tribe of Syria'. However, Abdul Medjuel or Abdul Mijwal (Slave of Medjul dates) is a nonsensical name. Arabic sources give the Shaikh's name as Mijwal al-Musrab. He was twenty years her junior, and the two were married under Muslim law and she took the name Jane Elizabeth Digby el Mezrab. Their marriage was a happy one and lasted until her death <b>twenty-eight</b> <b>years</b> later.

500|$|Hergé {{reached a}} {{particularly}} traumatic period {{in his life}} and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé <b>twenty-eight</b> <b>years</b> his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé's new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: [...] "It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: I was married, and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, {{but on the other hand}} I had this scout-like idea of giving my word for ever. It was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up." [...] During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as [...] "the beauty and cruelty of white"—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: [...] "At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and remember one where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that tried to catch me. And then instantly everything around me became white." ...|$|E
