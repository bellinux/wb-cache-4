25|$|Runs did not flow; {{they were}} grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as {{delivery}} after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb. For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through {{the cover and}} mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. When I joined him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single. If he ever scored a better hundred I hope that I am <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|With the South African tour {{cancelled}} {{a new one}} {{was arranged}} to Ceylon and Pakistan, which was in political turmoil {{that resulted in the}} fall of President Ayub Khan and imposition of martial law by his successor General Yahya Khan. After a few easy-going matches in Ceylon the tour match against the West Pakistan Governor's XI saw play abandoned after 25 overs, there were no other tour matches and all the Tests were affected by political demonstrations against the military regime. In the First Test at Lahore Cowdrey won the toss and made exactly 100, his 22nd Test century to match Wally Hammond's England record. England made 309, dismissed Pakistan for 209 and Cowdrey declared the second innings at 225/9 to give them 326 to win, but Pakistan made 203/5 for a draw. Saeed Ahmed won the toss in the Second Test at Dacca in East Pakistan, soon to be Bangladesh, where there was rioting and gunfire around the team hotel. Pakistan made 246, which was matched by England's 274, thanks to D'Oliveira's 114 not out. Pakistan took 101 overs to make 196/5 and a token declaration left England to make 33/0. Cowdrey won the toss again in the Third Test at Karachi, but there were riots on the first two days by fans who wanted Hanif Mohammad as captain instead of Saeed. England piled up 502/7, with Colin Milburn making 139 and Tom Graveney 105, but the match was abandoned after demonstrators wrecked the stadium {{on the morning of the}} third day, leaving Alan Knott stranded on 96 not out. Cowdrey was not <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as he left on the second day after his father-in-law died, leaving Graveney in charge. The team followed on the third day, with manager Les Ames abandoning the Test and the rest of the tour to save the team.|$|E
500|$|American Tragedy {{opens with}} the single [...] "Been to Hell". J-Dog said that the song is, [...] "the truth about what really happens to people when they move to L.A., to be actors or models or God knows what other {{delusions}} people have... failure. It's all too true, but most people aren't <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> first-hand. But we are, so it's our interpretation of it all." [...] The track is followed by [...] "Apologize", a track that directly addresses critics and states the band's defiance {{in the face of}} negative opinions, as evident by the chorus, [...] "We don't apologize and that's just the way it is, but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit." [...] Third is [...] "Comin’ in Hot", a party song and the album's fourth single that uses humor to describe what happens in night clubs. [...] "My Town" [...] is the fifth single and a mid-tempo song talking about Los Angeles and Hollywood. Next is [...] "I Don't Wanna Die", a song about the fear of death fueling the need to kill another person. [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] was the lead single from the album and is about the troubles each band member was going through at the time the song was written. The song's lyrics tell the story of a person who is depressed and hopeless, taking a very somber tone to the track. Despite this, the instruments and melodies contrast to make an uptempo track. Next is [...] "Gangsta Sexy", a party anthem song about heading to nightclubs and pursuing women. The following track, [...] "Glory", is a metal-inspired song which drew influence from war and fighting. [...] "Lights Out", the ninth song on the album, is about Deuce, ex-vocalist of Hollywood Undead. It is a response to [...] "Story of a Snitch". [...] "Coming Back Down", the third single released from the album, is a rock ballad song with acoustic guitars on the track. The lyrics describes about a story of an unknown loved one who has recently died, with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them. [...] "Bullet", the eleventh track from the album, is an uptempo pop song about suicide. It is played in an upbeat tempo with energetic vocals, which gives contrast to the dark lyrical content. Rick Florino called the track, [...] "heart-wrenching genius". [...] "Levitate" [...] is an uptempo discothèque song about sex, while the verses of the song talk about suicide and alcoholism. It was also featured in the [...] trailer, [...] "Autolog Drift Challenge", {{as well as on the}} game's soundtrack, where it was ranked eighth on ProGamists list of [...] "Top ten songs featured in racing games".|$|E

60|$|After a few strokes more, {{he stepped}} back from the foot of the tree to one side. Jonas {{wondered}} why he left his work before the tree fell.

60|$|But though Harriet {{may have}} cried {{when she got}} home on that fatal Friday evening, she was full of the triumph of the hunt on this morning.

40|$|If {{the philosopher}} has an {{analogue}} in the theatre, {{perhaps it is}} not with the performer, the one who shows, but with the stage-hand, the one who sets the stage. This is not, as some might argue, because the stage-hand has some special access to what is behind-the-scenes, or because she knows that what is on-stage is only illusion. The stage-hand’s work is not hidden. It is exactly the opposite: the work is <b>there</b> for all <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> is because it is there that all can <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> is the work that makes the seeing possible...|$|R
