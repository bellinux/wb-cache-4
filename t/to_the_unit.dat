5|$|The Battle of France, the German {{invasion}} of France and the Low Countries, began on 10 May 1940.

Wilcke bailed out and was taken prisoner of war. Following the armistice with France, he and Mölders, who had also been a prisoner of war, returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> on 30 June 1940.

5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement.

The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} its new aircraft, {{the squadron}} was tasked with anti-shipping attacks, and it and No.100 Squadron cooperated {{in an attack}} on a Japanese convoy near Cape St. George on the night of 20 October during which a No.6 Squadron pilot claimed to have damaged a cruiser. No.6 Squadron also bombed Japanese positions in New Britain during October in conjunction with No.100 Squadron. In addition to these offensive operations, the squadron regularly flew anti-submarine patrols to protect Allied shipping. In November the squadron moved to Goodenough Island and became part of No. 71 Wing RAAF alongside No.8 and No.100 Squadrons. From November 1943 to March 1944, No.6 Squadron took part in attacks on the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and also struck other targets in the region to support the naval and ground forces engaged in the New Britain Campaign. From March the squadron mainly undertook convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols, which proved uneventful. No.6 Squadron's operations were hampered by mechanical problems with its Beauforts, which had been issued <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> after being reconditioned following service with other RAAF squadrons, and this problem continued until October when it received an allocation of recently built aircraft.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{arrived in}} London on 25 July 1940, {{and met with}} de Gaulle, who {{announced}} that he was promoting him to Chef d'escadrons (major). He also encountered his cousin Pierre de Hauteclocque, Xavier's brother, who was serving with the 13e Demi-Brigade de Légion Étrangère (13e DBLE, an infantry regiment of the French Foreign Legion). This was the largest unit that had joined the Free French Forces. After participating in the Battles of Narvik, it had found itself in Britain when France surrendered. Formed after the war began, it contained many men who had fought for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War, and many refugees from Nazi and Fascist countries. De Hauteclocque then offered his own services <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit,</b> but its commander, Colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, rejected his offer on the grounds that he was high-born, over-qualified and a cavalryman.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the DISCOM {{consisted}} of a Headquarters Company, a Division Materiel Management Center, a Division Data Center, the 15th Medical Battalion, 15th Adjutant General Battalion, 15th Finance Company, 15th Supply and Transport Battalion, 27th Maintenance Battalion and the 68th Chemical Company. In October 1984, the 1st and 2nd Forward Support Battalions were activated from elements of the three functional battalions attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit.</b> The following year saw the Army of Excellence Reorganization (AOE) transform the remaining elements of the three functional battalions (maintenance, medical, and supply and transport) into the 4th Main Support Battalion. The AOE reorganization also added the 493rd Transportation Company (Aircraft Maintenance) to the Division Support Command. The forward and main support battalions, along with the Aviation Maintenance Company, were redesignated in 1987, becoming the 15th and 115th Forward Support Battalions, 27th Main Support Battalion, and 227th Transportation Company (Aviation Maintenance).|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen, {{the former}} Chief of the General staff, christened the ship at her {{commissioning}} on 6 March 1908. Captain Franz von Hipper was the ship's first commanding officer; he took {{command of the}} ship {{the day she was}} commissioned. He was tasked with conducting the ship's shakedown cruise, which lasted from 26 March to the middle of July. She officially joined the fleet on 12 July. The ship then departed for Asia, though Hipper left the ship and went on to command the I Torpedo-boat Division in Kiel. Gneisenau was assigned to the Ostasiengeschwader (East Asia Squadron), where in 1910 she joined Scharnhorst, which had been assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> the previous year. The two ships formed the core of the squadron, with Scharnhorst serving as the flagship. The pair were crack gunnery ships; Gneisenau won the Kaiser's Cup four times during her career: twice while in German waters in 1908 and 1909 and twice in Asia in 1910 and 1911, and Scharnhorsts finished in second place in 1913 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|Lafontaine had hesitated {{over the}} 24 hours since the {{afternoon}} of 13 May. He spent hours reconnoitring the terrain, sometimes trying to contain and reason with fleeing, routing scores of French infantrymen and artillerymen of the 55th and 71st Infantry Divisions, and travelling around the area to various regimental headquarters, looking for his Corps commander, General Gransard (whom was deliberately reconnoitring the terrain, for some time, at that relative point in time), for an order to attack, and, in the meantime, extemporarily assessing and conferring with some local command personnel. Owing to this Lafontaine also delayed issuing orders to the tactical attack units until 05:00 on 14 May, by which time the Germans had consolidated their bridgehead and the Panzer divisions' combined arms infantry teams were already advancing inland to Bulson. Lafontaine had had a mission plan since 20:00 on 13 May to defeat the Germans and retake the Meuse bridgeheads, but he waited for an order to proceed. Lafontaine's need for an order was contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> actions of the Germans, who operated the tactically more efficient Auftragstaktik (Mission Command) system. Ultimately, Lafontaine had squandered valuable hours essential for a prompt, perhaps opportune and timely, perhaps potentially decisive counter-attack effort.|$|E

5|$|Mercer's {{greatest}} passion however {{was reserved}} for the Canadian militia, which he joined as a student in 1881. Posted to The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada as a private soldier, Mercer devoted much time and energy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> and became an excellent soldier and first-rate shot. Mercer rose steadily {{through the ranks of}} the militia, being made an officer in 1885 and a captain in 1891. In 1903 as a brevet major, Mercer led a company to Sault Ste. Marie to calm a riot by striking dock workers, his only deployment before 1914. In 1911, Mercer was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the regiment and in 1913, Mercer was aide-de-camp to Defence Minister Sam Hughes during a military tour of Europe, during which he inspected the German army first-hand and became convinced that war was imminent.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Commando Regiment, {{then known}} as 4 RAR (Cdo), was {{deployed}} {{as a part of}} the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in 2001. When notified to replace 1 RAR in East Timor, 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion, developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR. With the commitment to East Timor continuing, however, 4 RAR was re-roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to East Timor as AUSBATT IV. This involved reorganising from the existing two commando-companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel. This saw B and C Company remain commando-qualified. A Company was formed in June 2000 followed by D Company in November both filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit.</b> The battalion took official control over Area of Operations (AO) Matilda in the northern border region on 25 April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Sengelman.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Army {{sought to}} forge a strong esprit de corps among the new recruits, and to this end {{extended}} them several sentimental allowances: for example, morale amongst the Frenchmen rose when they were informed that the Rhodesian insignia on their berets would be backed with the French tricolour. In a similar vein, their request for permission to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia outside their headquarters each morning was approved. French-speaking men already in the army were attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> to act as interpreters and assist with coordination and tactical instruction. Some of these were Mauritians, who {{by virtue of their}} upbringing spoke both English and French at a native-like level. The company itself, which numbered about 200 men, was assigned headquarters near Salisbury at Cranborne Barracks, the home of the Rhodesian Light Infantry. It was organised {{in the same manner as}} a standard Rhodesian independent company, the only exception being its exclusively francophone personnel.|$|E
