5|$|In 1969 Stanley Marcus {{recommended}} {{to the board}} of directors that the company merge with Broadway-Hale of California in order to have enough capital to expand. Neiman's subsequently became a subsidiary of Carter-Hawley Hale, Inc., and Marcus accepted a position as corporate executive vice president and director of CHH. He retired as Chairman Emeritus in 1975, <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> store to his son, Richard C. Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{was first}} {{attracted}} {{to the study of}} electricity when he saw the showman Archibald Spencer do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744). He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was a spike {{in the number of}} suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.|$|E
5|$|With Belldandy and Keiichi now {{portrayed as}} a couple, Fujishima {{introduces}} other factors: specifically the complications caused by family and friends. Forced to leave his dorm, as women {{are not permitted to}} stay on the premises, Keiichi and Belldandy end up living at the Tariki Hongan Temple in the city of Nekomi, Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo. Within both the manga and the anime, the temple was turned over to them by its former guardian, Koshian, a Buddhist monk who was overwhelmed by the purity of Belldandy's spirit and her unparalleled skills in polishing the temple altar, in cooking, and in Zazen meditation. Koshian departs the series by leaving for a pilgrimage to find spiritual perfection, (although he does briefly return later in the series), <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> temple to Belldandy and Keiichi's care without realizing Belldandy's true nature as a Goddess. Later, Fujishima has Belldandy's two sisters (Urd and Skuld) join Belldandy and Keiichi in the temple. The story then follows the numerous misadventures of the not-so normal household, their growth {{over the course of the}} series and the budding romance between an ordinary young man and an angelic goddess.|$|E

25|$|The fraud that {{he spoke}} of {{regarding}} Fabre had been carried out in early October, when the French East India Company had been liquidated {{in accordance with the}} anti-capitalist legislation of the summer.

In 1794, Robespierre had evidence of Fabre’s criminality and he denounced Fabre for what he viewed as a particular heinous crime, criminality disguised by patriotism.|$|E

25|$|The rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} flitting among dense cover {{but also in}} more open {{positions}} on trees, the tops of bushes and on posts. It is frequently seen on the ground hopping about and flaring and bobbing its tail up and down. When perched it also displays its tail in this way and also sometimes droops its wings before giving them a little flick forward. It feeds mainly on the ground on insects such as beetles, grasshoppers and the larvae of butterflies and moths, and on earthworms, <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter to find its prey.|$|E
25|$|An {{advance on}} the basic design was the iron ploughshare, a {{replaceable}} horizontal cutting surface mounted {{on the tip of}} the share. The earliest ploughs with a detachable and replaceable share date from around 1000 BC in the Ancient Near East, and the earliest iron ploughshares from ca. 500 BC in China. Early mouldboards were basically wedges that sat inside the cut formed by the coulter, <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> soil to the side. The ploughshare spread the cut horizontally below the surface, so when the mouldboard lifted it, a wider area of soil was turned over. Mouldboards are known in Britain from the late 6th century on.|$|E

He confirmed that the investigation supported claims made by The Washington Post and other sources of dirty tricks committed and funded by the Committee to Re-Elect the President, notably activities of questionable legality committed by Donald Segretti. The White House had for months steadfastly denied any involvement in such activities.|$|E

25|$|When {{faced with}} a 3rd down and 7 on their ensuing drive, Bradshaw once again made a crucial long pass {{completion}} to Stallworth, this time a 45-yard reception to the Rams 22-yard line, barely beyond the outstretched hand of Perry. Two plays later, a pass interference penalty on Los Angeles cornerback Pat Thomas {{in the end zone}} gave the Steelers a first down at the 1-yard line. The Rams managed to keep Bleier and Harris out of the end zone for two plays, but Harris then scored on a third-down, 1-yard touchdown run to give the Steelers a 31–19 lead and put the game away. The Rams responded by driving to Pittsburgh's 37-yard line, but ended up <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ball on downs with 39 seconds left in the game, and the Steelers ran out the clock for the win.|$|E
25|$|Head Coach Jim Mora era {{began his}} {{coaching}} debut for the Seahawks with {{a game at}} home against division rival St. Louis Rams. Quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and the offense struggled early, <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ball three times (two interceptions and one fumble) on the first quarter alone. After Rams kicker Olindo Mare missed a 37-yard field goal for the lead, Hasselbeck led the Seahawks to their first score of the game after he connected with tight end John Carlson for a touchdown. With the second quarter coming to a close, St. Louis returned a blocked field goal for a touchdown, only to have it overruled by a penalty. This gave another chance for the Seahawks to score, as Hasselbeck threw his second touchdown of the game to Nate Burleson to put the Seahawks up 14–0 by halftime.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new (and founding) Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena, Jean-Baptiste Brondel, {{invited the}} Ursuline {{religious}} order {{of women to}} join the Jesuits at St. Peter's Mission in January 1884. A sister in the Toledo chapter, Mother Mary Amadeus (Sarah Therese Dunne), led five Ursulines to St. Peter's in October. They quickly established a boarding school for girls (open to children of settlers and Native Americans). The Jesuits gave the nuns $200 in provisions, a farm, some cows, and some wagons to help them survive, and promised to pay them $200 a year to teach boys if more nuns could {{be brought to the}} mission. In 1885, the Jesuits began <b>turning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> educational duties of St. Peter's Mission to the Ursulines, who opened St. Peter's Industrial School for Girls that year with 11 Blackfeet students.|$|E
