5|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
25|$|E: As I {{lay in bed}} <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> overheard {{the three}} doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, {{she became}} the {{youngest}} pupil to graduate from the Guildhall School of Music at the time, and the following year she won the Dawn Beauty Competition, winning £50. As she matured into a young woman, O'Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected her for a while. In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically. My arms felt like lead. I gave a rotten show <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> grew up with the terrible feeling that I was being laughed at".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jayson Rodriguez for MTV News, da Don explained how he conceptualized the song, saying [...] "I came from a Jerry Bruckheimer meeting after seeing the movie, and they were telling us all the music they needed for all the scenes and the characters. So <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> went to the studio and I was telling Chris about (the meeting). And he was like, 'Let's get on it.' It was crazy, because Jerry Bruckheimer's dream {{was to have a}} song from Rihanna (for the movie), and I delivered Rihanna and Chris Brown in 24 hours. So they were like, 'Wow, that's crazy. He continued to explain how he, Rihanna and Brown developed the song in the recording studio, saying [...] "When her, Chris and myself were in the room, it's fun. That's when the music isn't work at all. It's all freestyle. Chris comes up with an idea; I come up with one. Rihanna will weigh in. And we build." [...] The song leaked on January 6, 2009. Their version of the song was excluded from the soundtrack, in favor of a version performed by the American girl group The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
2500|$|At first , we {{were called}} Force. I {{think we had}} gotten that name from a UFO album, {{but there was also}} a band called Rising Force with Yngwie Malmsteen. And then I thought, 'We should move up. We should do {{something}} else.' <b>That</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> was so nervous telling them I thought it should be Europe. They got so quiet after I told them. But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the website New Release Tuesday, August said [...] "I ended up moving back to Dallas, got involved in church again and one <b>night</b> <b>I</b> realized <b>that</b> I hadn't had true convictions in years. I hated that and it hit me hard. <b>I</b> decided <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to rededicate my music and my life to God. That was January 18, 2009. <b>That's</b> the <b>night</b> <b>I</b> wrote 'Starry Night'." [...] He was signed to Fervent Records and soon shared the song with his new record label. The meaning behind the song is August's reflection on how people can take great photographs or make great paintings about objects, yet these objects and everything else were created by God.|$|R

2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers. I kept shaking my head [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> was on my way back to New York with Frank.|$|E
2500|$|According to Packard, {{the core}} {{idea for the}} series emerged from bedtime stories that he told to his daughters, {{revolving}} around a character named Pete and his adventures. Packard stated, [...] "I had a character named Pete and I usually had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island. But <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> {{was running out of}} things for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do." [...] His two daughters came up with different paths for the story to take and Packard thought up an ending for each of the paths. [...] "What really struck me was the natural enthusiasm they had for the idea. And I thought: 'Could I write this down?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wild {{was looking}} forward to a fast ride on his first country train journey in many years. In the early days of his youth, in the 1930s, {{railways}} were always pushing to achieve an average speed of 60 miles per hour (97km/h). He had grown up [...] "when speed was regarded as the essential thing on the railway". But disappointment in his trip came when he realised that despite the train's much-publicised but very brief dash at 160 km/h, the journey, over all, had the leisurely features of a branch-line train. ... In the end, the journey took 4 hours and 37 minutes – 20 minutes longer than scheduled, at an average speed of 70.6 kilometres per hour. [...] I was absolutely appalled by the whole thing. After I flew home <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> looked up an old reference book. [...] I learned that if the train had completed the run in an even four hours – a schedule that was soon to be introduced – it would have travelled at the same average speed of 81.6 km/h as the London to Bristol Express in 1851.|$|E

2500|$|... "In one {{championship}} with Crispa, walo lang kami (there {{were only}} eight of us), some were even fetched from the hospital. In those days, when your team only had seven players, you automatically lose by default. That {{was the fifth}} game, against Toyota. I didn't play the previous game but <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> was a starter. In my entire basketball career, I never practiced as a point guard. Even in that particular game, Baby (Dalupan) did not tell me that I was starting as a point guard. He just sent me out there. In the previous game, I noticed that Hubalde was playing forward. When he attracted a double-team, he'd swing the ball but {{the man at the}} top of the key couldn't deliver. Atoy Co couldn't get the ball because he was also well-covered. So the next game, the whole evening I was the point guard. We won the championship. I dominated the game. It was my show the whole evening. That's the kind of talent Baby has. Baby has some moves that would just change the face or the tempo of the game. I don't know where he got those ideas. Whoever thought I would be playing as a point guard?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1944, {{all of the}} Resistance governments {{agreed to}} accept the {{authority}} of the Free French government based in Algiers (until 1962 Algeria was considered to be part of France) and the Resistance was renamed FFI (Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur-Forces of the Interior). The Germans refused to accept the resistance as legitimate opponents and any résistant captured faced the prospect of torture and/or execution as the Germans maintained that the Hague and Geneva conventions did not apply to the resistance. By designating the resistance as part of the French armed forces was intended to provide the Resistance with legal protection and allow the French to threaten the Germans with the possibility of prosecution for war crimes. The designation did not help. For example, the résistante Sindermans was arrested in Paris on 24 February 1944 after she was found to be carrying forged papers. As she recalled: [...] "Immediately, they handcuffed me and took me to be interrogated. Getting no reply, they slapped in the face with such force that I fell from the chair. Then they whipped me with a rubber hose, full in the face. The interrogation began at 10 o'clock in the morning and ended at 11 o'clock <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> must tell you I had been pregnant for three months".|$|E
2500|$|By 1942 {{she was a}} star in the Chicago area, {{performing}} at the Rhumboogie Club. The band leader and arranger Marl Young who worked at the club recognised her talent and signed her under contract to the then famous Club DeLisa. [...] A year later, the future owner of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, heard her sing in Washington DC and wrote in his memoirs:"1943, I was about 19 years old; I went to a nightclub in the northeast black district of Washington DC and heard a singer named Little Miss Cornshucks and thought: 'Oh God!' She was better than anything I had heard so far. She came across like a country girl, provided with a headscarf and a basket in her hand and so on; but she could sing the blues better than anyone I've heard to date. <b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> asked her if I could record a record with her. We then played Kansas City and a few other blues numbers and the song So Long. She had such a wonderful sound and I remember how I always thought, 'Oh my God, and I have no record company; I can make the drive just for myself.'" [...] "So Long" [...] became her signature tune and a regional hit in 1943 for the short-lived Sunbeam label.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 November 1971, {{when the}} natural climate {{was dry and}} more {{adaptable}} and by which time the Bangladesh Forces had severely weakened {{the strength of the}} West Pakistan Forces through its guerilla operations, under a complicated politico-military scenario. India-Pakistan war of 1971 breaks out and Indian troops enter Bangladesh allied with Mukti Bahini. The Pakistani force were demoralized from constant attacks by the Mukti Bahini, on 16 December 1971 the Pakistani Military force in Bangladesh surrender to a joint force of Indian and Bangladesh forces. Group Captain A. K. Khandker represented the Bangladeshi side at the signing of the surrender treaty. K M Shafiullah, S Force commander, and a handful of others were also among the hundreds of local masses who surrounded the event from a distance. [...] "No protocol was set on what they were supposed to do". A fact Shafiullah admitted himself. [...] "We rushed to the Race Course from the airport. I was a member of Bangladesh delegation. But we were not sure what we were supposed to do. I {{was standing in front of}} the signing table. That's why I do not appear in any photographs. There was rejoicing all around.

2500|$|... "The days soon arrived when, on forced marches {{after the}} enemy, all {{discharges}} of firearms {{except at the}} enemy were strictly prohibited under severe penalty. [...] Being out on the right flank one day, just {{out of sight of}} the troops, I came upon a beautiful covey of grouse. [...] They were so tame I could almost knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> could not hit them. [...] So finally, in spite of those orders and with growing appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle. [...] The right wing of the command was wildly excited by the shots. [...] The skirmishers thrown out on that side soon discovered my lonely presence and hustled me to Colonel Chambers with the news that no Indians were visible. [...] He very sternly asked. [...] ‘Mr. Strahorn, did you do that firing?" [...] Upon my answering, [...] "Yes sir," [...] he still more gruffly asked, [...] "At Indians, or what?" [...] "Not at Indians, Colonel, but at grouse," [...] I answered. [...] "I was so hungry for grouse that I just couldn’t help it, so I’m ready to pay the penalty. [...] What is it?’ [...] Be it remembered that I was in the Colonel’s mess, and he replied quietly on the side, ‘Well, it will make a damn sight of difference whether you got a grouse.’" ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatum drew {{inspiration}} from the pianists James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, who exemplified the stride piano style, and from the more [...] "modern" [...] Earl Hines, six years Tatum's senior. [...] Tatum identified Waller as his main influence, but according to pianist Teddy Wilson and saxophonist Eddie Barefield, [...] "Art Tatum's favorite jazz piano player was Earl Hines. He used to buy all of Earl's records and would improvise on them. He'd play the record but he'd improvise over what Earl was doing ... 'course, when you heard Art play you didn't hear nothing of anybody but Art. But he got his ideas from Earl's style of playing – but Earl never knew that." [...] A major event in his meteoric rise to success was his appearance at a cutting contest in 1933 at Morgan's bar in New York City that included Waller, Johnson and Willie [...] "The Lion" [...] Smith. [...] Standard contest pieces included Johnson's [...] "Harlem Strut" [...] and [...] "Carolina Shout", and Waller's [...] "Handful of Keys". Tatum performed his arrangements of [...] "Tea for Two" [...] and [...] "Tiger Rag", in a performance that {{was considered to be}} the last word in stride piano. [...] Johnson, reminiscing about Tatum's debut afterward, simply said, [...] "When Tatum played Tea For Two <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> guess {{that was the first time}} I ever heard it really played." [...] Tatum's debut was historic because he outplayed the elite competition and heralded the demise of the stride era. [...] He was not challenged further until stride specialist Donald Lambert initiated a half-serious rivalry with him.|$|E
