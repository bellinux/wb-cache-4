40|$|Abstract. Facial nerve {{paralysis}} is {{a common}} disease due to nerve damage. Most approaches for evaluating <b>the</b> degree of <b>facial</b> paralysis rely {{on a set of}} different facial movements as commanded by doctors. Therefore, automatic recognition of <b>the</b> patterns of <b>facial</b> movement is fundamental to the evaluation of <b>the</b> degree of <b>facial</b> paralysis. In this paper, a novel method named Active Shape Models plus Local Binary Patterns (ASMLBP) is presented for recognizing facial movement patterns. Firstly, the Active Shape Models (ASMs) are used in the method to locate facial key points. According to these points, the face is divided into eight local regions. Then the descriptors of these regions are extracted by using Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to recognize <b>the</b> patterns of <b>facial</b> movement. <b>The</b> proposed ASMLBP method is tested on both <b>the</b> collected <b>facial</b> paralysis database with 57 patients and another publicly available database named <b>the</b> Japanese Female <b>Facial</b> Expression (JAFFE). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient for both paralyzed and normal faces...|$|R

5|$|Although both colour morphs {{occur in}} much of the European range, brown birds predominate in the more humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase {{becoming}} more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour.

The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> contusions healed.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents. The reliability of <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed to countries including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{perception}} of facial expressions with scaling differences, pose variations and occlusions would greatly enhance natural human robot interaction. This research proposes unsupervised automatic facial point detection integrated with regression-based intensity estimation for facial action units (AUs) and emotion clustering {{to deal with}} such challenges. <b>The</b> proposed <b>facial</b> point detector is able to detect 54 facial points in images of faces with occlusions, pose variations and scaling differences using Gabor filtering, BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints), an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. Especially, in order to effectively deal with images with occlusions, ICP is first applied to generate neutral landmarks for <b>the</b> occluded <b>facial</b> elements. Then FCM is used to further reason the shape of <b>the</b> occluded <b>facial</b> region by taking the prior knowledge of <b>the</b> non-occluded <b>facial</b> elements into account. Post landmark correlation processing is subsequently applied to derive the best fitting geometry for <b>the</b> occluded <b>facial</b> element to further adjust the neutral landmarks generated by ICP and reconstruct <b>the</b> occluded <b>facial</b> region. We then conduct AU intensity estimation respectively using support vector regression and neural networks for 18 selected AUs. FCM is also subsequently employed to recognize seven basic emotions as well as neutral expressions. It also shows great potential to deal with compound and newly arrived novel emotion class detection. The overall system is integrated with a humanoid robot and enables it to deal with challenging real-life facial emotion recognition tasks...|$|R
