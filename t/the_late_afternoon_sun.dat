500|$|Torrez {{was removed}} from the game after walking Mickey Rivers. [...] Reliever Bob Stanley came in, and after Rivers stole second Thurman Munson drove him in with a double. In the eighth inning, a home run by Reggie Jackson made the score 5–2 in favor of the Yankees. [...] The Red Sox cut New York's lead to just one run {{in the bottom of the}} eighth against closer Goose Gossage on RBI singles by Fred Lynn and Yastrzemski. [...] But the Yankees would hold off the Red Sox, thanks in part to a heads-up {{defensive}} play by right fielder Lou Piniella with one out in the bottom of the ninth. [...] With Burleson on first base, Jerry Remy hit a line drive to Piniella in right field, but Piniella was blinded by <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> and could not see the ball. However, he pretended to field the play normally, pounding his glove as though he would easily catch the ball. [...] This prevented Burleson from advancing to third base. [...] When Jim Rice followed with a deep fly to the outfield, Burleson could only move up to third base instead of scoring the tying run.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the city}} proper {{just south of}} the main plaza, is the Cathedral, which is located over the ruins of pre-Hispanic temples. The current {{structure}} dates from 1752 and has a façade of sculpted pink stone. The best time to appreciate the façade is in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> shines directly on it. This church is considered {{to be one of the}} best examples of Mexican Churrigueresque architecture. The first parish church was built on this site between 1567 and 1585, but it was in ruins by the beginning of the 17th century. A second church was built between 1612 and 1625 and was called the Chapel of Santo Cristo. [...] The remains of this construction can be seen in the first level of the south tower and the main façade. The current cathedral was begun in 1729 with main façade finished in 1745 but not opened to worship until 1752.|$|R
40|$|The site {{designated}} {{for the new}} St. Anthony’s primary school is located on a gentle slope eastward with steep incline to the west. This west hill helps form a natural barrier against the wind driven rains during southwest monsoons as well as protecting from <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> summer <b>sun</b> (Fig. 2). The school requires a total built-up space of ap-proximately 1500 m. Classroom spaces comprise 41 % of the total school programme (Fig. 3). Consider-ing also the long occupancy periods in classrooms, it clearly puts emphasis {{on the need for}} a well designed classroom space.

It forced his gaze over and beyond toward the west, where <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> had begun to mellow and redden, edging the clouds with exquisite light. To the southward lay Arizona, land of painted mesas and storied canyon walls, of thundering streams and wild pine forests, of purple-saged valleys and grassy parks, set like mosaics between the stark desert mountains.|$|E

50|$|After winning two {{battles in}} the space of a few hours, the {{soldiers}} must have doubted their ability to prevail in a third but once again the ingenuity of Prior Abernethy saved the day. As the finale to a stirring speech he bade the tired soldiers look towards the Pentland Hills where a band of hard-working Cistercian monks under the prior's instructions had erected a huge canvas saltire, a silver cross on a blue background shining in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> to inspire them to one last effort. Approaching along the valley from Borthwick Castle via Rosewell, the remaining English forces under Sir Richard Neville were defeated and the Battle of Rosslyn finally won.|$|E

5000|$|The pyramid {{consists}} {{of a series of}} square terraces with stairways up each of the four sides to the temple on top. Sculptures of plumed serpents run down the sides of the northern balustrade. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> strikes off the northwest corner of the pyramid and casts a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade, creating the illusion of a feathered serpent [...] "crawling" [...] down the pyramid. The event has been very popular, but it is questionable whether it is a result of a purposeful design. Each of the pyramid's four sides has 91 steps which, when added together and including the temple platform on top as the final [...] "step", produces a total of 365 steps (which is equal to the number of days of the Haab' year).|$|E
5000|$|The {{coniferous}} {{trees of the}} boreal forest of Canada are recurring motifs in Ruberg's watercolour paintings. They are represented as symbols of strength. These trees are well adapted to survive prolonged northern winters (their branches shed snow easily and their needle leaves help retain water and warmth). Ruberg felt special attachment to the conifers, saying [...] "I have always felt a strong pull towards the north country. I grew up by a large forest of fir trees. The fir tree {{is a part of}} home to me."A typical compositional arrangement in a Ruberg watercolour painting is a row of trees {{standing in front of a}} sunlit sky. In a painting where the sun explicitly appears, its effect is to fill the sky with a warm palette of colour.

50|$|The massing of the {{building}} is rectangular, roughly 144 by 275 ft, oriented so that the short dimension faces South Park Row, to the north. The front (north) elevation contains a slight projecting center bay, at the entrance. Until recently (1991-92), a large projecting Ionic Order covered porch highlighted the main public entrance to {{the building}}; it was recently found to be structurally unsound, dismantled, and stored on site, pending funding for its eventual restoration. Directly above the main entrance is a terra cotta palladian window, with recessed circular niches and festooned garlands across the head. The east and west sides {{of the building}} contain projecting central sections; each is three bays in width. On the east side, the secondary entrance to the building {{is set in a}} rusticated granite entrance way with an arched door. The arched window on the second floor, directly above, is also flanked by coffered niches, set in the brick. On the west side, the large window at the stair landing has been infilled with glass block (presumably done as a retrofit at some point in an attempt to relieve the building's occupants of <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> glare).|$|E

5000|$|The circus is constructed, {{after the}} fashion of many Roman {{buildings}} of this period, in concrete faced with opus vittatum. The putlog holes which held the scaffolding are evident in many places in the walls, which stand several metres high in places. The modern-day visitor enters the circus from the west end, where {{the remains of the}} two still imposing towers are located. These would have contained the mechanism for raising the carceres (starting gates), which were positioned on an arcuated course between the towers. Once out of the gates, the chariots would race down the track, the full [...] length of which can still be seen. The track was excavated in the 19th century by Antonio Nibby, whose discovery of an inscription to the 'divine Romulus' led to the circus being positively identified with Maxentius. The spina, the barrier running {{down the middle of the}} track, is exactly 1000 Roman feet (296 m) long, and would have been cased in marble. Its many ornaments, including cones, metae and obelisks, would have cast strange, Piranesi-esque shadows across the track in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> In the centre stood the Obelisk of Domitian which Maxentius presumably had moved from the Isaeum as part of the tribute to his son. Covered in hieroglyphs and lying broken in five pieces it was much discussed during the Renaissance and engraved by Etienne du Perac among others. The Collector Earl of Arundel paid a deposit for the pieces in the 1630s and attempted to have them removed to London but Urban VIII forbad its export and his successor Innocent X had it erected in the Piazza Navona by Bernini. The track's outer walls were laid out to be wider at the start to allow the racers to spread out before reaching the spina, and were also made wider at the point of the turn, which accommodated the turning circle of the chariots. At the east end of the track is a small triumphal arch, in which exposed opus vittatum work can be seen. The judges' box was located about two-thirds of the way down on the southern side of the track, where it would have been in clear sight of the finishing line. The imperial box, the remains of which are identifiable, was situated in the usual fashion to give the most dramatic views of the race. Directly opposite the imperial box, in the south track wall, there is a small arch, through which can be seen the Tomb of Caecilia Metella. From the height of the box the tomb would have been entirely visible, and it has been argued that the circus, which is curiously positioned relative to contemporary and existing structures, was purposely skewed in order to integrate the tomb into the Maxentian architectural scheme.|$|E
