5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E

5|$|Ofotbanen {{lost their}} license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7October 2008. This was because Ofotbanen had not {{documented}} necessary accounts for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary liquidity. On 24October, {{the company was}} declared bankrupt. Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK10 million.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} Indian tribes {{have a common}} law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon {{aboriginal}} title, that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that cause of action, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> action was not barred by a statute of limitations, abatement, implicit federal ratification, or nonjusticiability. Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of laches, a question which the majority did not reach, but expressed doubts about.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{the problem was}} that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{the accident was}} Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot {{might have been the}} root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> her death could not be determined.|$|E

They expressed their worries about conversion because it impacted the Buddhist community.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bankruptcy, Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in bankruptcy. They also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically sound to operate. The company filed for bankruptcy in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E
5|$|In September 2005, an Israeli-declared AIDS expert {{claimed that}} Arafat bore all the {{symptoms}} of AIDS based on obtained medical records. But others, including Patrice Mangin of the University of Lausanne and The New York Times disagreed with this claim, insisting that Arafat's record indicated that it was highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> his death was AIDS. Arafat's personal doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi and aide Bassam Abu Sharif maintained that Arafat was poisoned, possibly by thallium. A senior Israeli physician concluded that Arafat died from food poisoning. Both those claims were rejected by Haaretz and The New York Times. Then-Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath had also ruled out poisoning after talks with Arafat's French doctors.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion and concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E
40|$|Pierre Fortin's {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{increase in}} Canada's debt-to-output ratio is reconsidered.

We also extend Fortin's analysis to examine <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> debt accumulation by level of government.

5|$|On 8 April 1954, Comet G-ALYY ("Yoke Yoke"), on {{charter to}} South African Airways, {{was on a}} leg from Rome to Cairo (of a longer route, SA Flight 201 from London to Johannesburg), when it crashed in the Mediterranean near Naples {{with the loss of}} all 21 {{passengers}} and crew on board. The Comet fleet was immediately grounded once again and a large investigation board was formed {{under the direction of the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). Prime Minister Winston Churchill tasked the Royal Navy with helping to locate and retrieve the wreckage so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the accident could be determined. The Comet's Certificate of Airworthiness was revoked and Comet 1 line production was suspended at the Hatfield factory while the BOAC fleet was permanently grounded, cocooned and stored.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{was followed by}} a national day of mourning in Canada, and a ban on all E350 Ford Club Wagon type vehicles being used for student transport in New Brunswick. Two investigations, one by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the other by Transport Canada, found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the disaster was a combination of poor road conditions, lack of proper snow tires, and possible driver error. Pressure from the public and victims' families prompted the chief coroner of the province to launch an inquiry, which produced recommendations to improve student transport safety in New Brunswick. The provincial government agreed with the majority of the suggestions and has since enacted many of them.|$|E
5|$|The former Oxford University {{historian}} Adrian Goldsworthy {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{the fall of}} the Roman Empire in the West should not be blamed on barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent civil wars, which led to its ability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers to be seriously weakened.

5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB accident report determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' {{said that he would}} have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E
5|$|Nuka-Worlds {{release date}} of August 30, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was {{announced}} in a post on the Bethesda Game Studios blog on August 15,. along with the expansion's trailer. Bethesda started releasing keys for the beta version on August 16 and pre-release gameplay was live streamed through Twitch.tv on August 23, with the official trailer coming out two days later. The expansion has a larger file size than Far Harbor, being 3.66 GB as opposed to 2.69 GB. This resulted in people wondering if Nuka-World would contain more gameplay, although the price implied it would be somewhere between Automatron and Far Harbor. The North American release of Nuka-World on PlayStation 4 was delayed due to unknown problems. Unlike the PS4 launch of Far Harbor, no major stability or frame-rate issues were found while playing, except when inside a location called The Galactic Zone. In the article on the website Push Square, it was noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the frame-rate issues in The Galactic Zone were unknown and were not consistent.|$|E
