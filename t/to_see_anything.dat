5|$|Dorothy and Toto {{discover}} {{that they are in}} Munchkinland, a small town part of the vast Land of Oz. After discussing her situation with the town's people, the Munchkins (played by Rizzo the Rat and the other rats), she learns that the land's ruler the Wizard, has the power to grant her wish of becoming a famous singer. She meets the Good Witch of the North (Miss Piggy), and receives a pair of magic silver slippers from the Wicked Witch of the East (Miss Piggy), the Witch of the North's sister who was killed when Dorothy's trailer fell on her. Soon after, she embarks on a journey with Toto on the yellow brick road to meet the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the Emerald City, the capital of Oz. On her journey, she meets three creatures: a Scarecrow (Kermit), a Tin Thing (Gonzo), and a Cowardly Lion (Fozzie). They are also seeking the Wizard of Oz to give them a brain, heart, and courage, respectively. The group meets various obstacles involving a deep gorge where the Kalidah Critics (Statler and Waldorf) are heckling them and a Poppy Field Club run by Clifford which nearly puts them to sleep. After arriving at the Emerald City and meeting the Wizard, Dorothy and her friends are sent to retrieve the Wicked Witch of the West's magic eye, a tool she uses <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> she desires in the Land of Oz.|$|E

The ITS are managed by two traffic management centers (TMC), one located in Pompano Beach, and the other located in Ocoee, operated by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

25|$|Madden's fear {{of flying}} (aviophobia) is well known. Two {{different}} theories have developed as to the cause. One theory relates to the October 29, 1960, Cal Poly football team plane crash that {{claimed the lives of}} sixteen players, the team’s student manager, and a football booster. Having graduated from Cal Poly only two years prior, Madden lost many friends in the accident. However, it is known that Madden flew up until 1979, when he had a panic attack on a flight originating in Tampa. The details, nature and extent of this panic attack are not known. Madden, however, stated once in an interview that his fears were not about turbulence, flying, or heights, but primarily claustrophobia. He also once noted that when he did fly, traveling all over the United States, it did not allow him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E

25|$|Leaving Northern Ireland on 9 March 1944, 2nd Escort Group {{moved to}} the area {{believed}} to hold the highest concentration of U-boats.

Their first attack was unsuccessful dropping two depth charges that failed to explode believed {{to be caused by}} faulty safety clips, during the attack the rear gunner in the Swordfish was killed by the U-boats anti-aircraft guns. The depth charges dropped short on a second attack and failed to explode on a third attack during the same night. On the night of 15 March two Swordfish got an ASV contact ahead of the escort group.

500|$|Gordon-Cumming was {{replaced}} in the witness box by the prince. Examined by Clarke, {{he stated that}} he had not seen any cheating, and was ignorant of the accusations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. After 20 minutes of questions from both Clarke and Russell, the prince was free to depart. As the prince was leaving the witness box, a member of the jury put two questions to Edward: whether the heir had seen [...] "nothing of the alleged malpractices of the plaintiff?", and [...] "what was your Royal Highness's opinion at the time as to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" [...] To the first question the prince replied {{that he had not}}, although he explained that [...] "it is not usual for a banker <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> in dealing cards"; to the second, he stated that [...] "the charges appeared to be so unanimous that it was the proper course—no other course was open to me—than to believe them". In comparison with Gordon-Cumming's performance in the witness box, Edward did not make a strong impression; the reporter for The New York Times noticed [...] "that the heir apparent was decidedly fidgety, that he kept changing his position, and that he did not seem able to keep his hands still... Except to those near him, only two or three of his answers were fairly audible throughout the courtroom". The Daily News agreed, and stated that the impression gained from the prince's performance was unfavourable.|$|E
500|$|After Oakley and Weinstein left The Simpsons, {{they created}} Mission Hill in 1997, {{a show about}} a hip, lazy, 24-year-old {{cartoonist}} named Andy French, and sold it to The WB for a fall 1999 debut. They pitched the show in 1998 [...] "as an animated series for young adults with a sophisticated, Simpsons-style sensibility." [...] They aimed to make the show about realistic issues affecting young adults, which were too mature for The Simpsons. The network was impressed and initially ordered 13 episodes; they ordered five more once the first was completed. Oakley explained: [...] "The audience we're going for is one that's sophisticated, that likes high and low humor, that's very savvy in animation. [...] this show is definitely a case {{where a lot of}} people don't get it. It's not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It's observational humor. It's jokes told in a weird way, in the background or with a bizarre sound effect." [...] The show was plagued by [...] "public relations" [...] difficulties, which meant it was [...] "tarnished" [...] from the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual upfronts, was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter. Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> of the show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to the Washington Post, [...] "for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it." [...] The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as The Deseret News; and earned a positive write-up in Variety. Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of The Downtowners due to its closeness to an MTV show. All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it. Weinstein stated: [...] "I don't know exactly why America doesn't know about this show. It's like Teen People came out with its fall preview, and we're not even in it." [...] Mission Hill came {{at a time when the}} TV schedules were already saturated with animated shows; some of the response could be chalked up to its genre.|$|E

2500|$|T. S. Eliot's [...] "The Waste Land" [...] is a {{foundational}} text of modernism, {{representing the}} moment at which Imagism moves into modernism proper. Broken, fragmented and seemingly unrelated slices of imagery come {{together to form a}} disjunctive anti-narrative. The motif of sight and vision is as central to the poem as it is to modernism; the omni-present character Tiresias acting as a unifying theme. The reader is thrown into confusion, unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> but a heap of broken images. The narrator, however (in [...] "The Waste Land" [...] as in other texts), promises to show the reader a different meaning; that is, how to make meaning from dislocation and fragmentation. This construction of an exclusive meaning is essential to modernism.|$|E

2500|$|Writer Peter Guralnick {{is among}} those to {{identify}} Solomon Burke as {{a key figure in}} the emergence of soul music, and Atlantic Records as the key record label. Burke's early 1960s songs, including [...] "Cry to Me", [...] "Just Out of Reach" [...] and [...] "Down in the Valley" [...] are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: [...] "Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's [...] "Just Out Of Reach". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke — primarily in a pop vein. [...] Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> even resembling a movement." ...|$|E
