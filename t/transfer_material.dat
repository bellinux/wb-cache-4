2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of <b>transfer</b> <b>material</b> could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The CdSe/ZnS core/shell {{quantum dots}} (QDs) were {{synthesized}} and characterized with absorption spectrometry, photoluminescence (PL) spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy. PL quenching of colloidal CdSe/ZnS QDs {{in the presence}} of charge <b>transferring</b> <b>material</b> was studied by means of steady-state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy. With increasing charge <b>transferring</b> <b>materials</b> concentration in the CdSe/ZnS QDs solution, the PL intensity and lifetime of CdSe/ZnS QDs decrease gradually. The quenching efficiency of CdSe/ZnS QDs decrease with increasing the oxidation potential of charge <b>transferring</b> <b>materials.</b> Based on the analysis, there are two pathways in the PL quenching process: static quenching and dynamic quenching. The dynamic quenching is correlated with hole transfer from QDs to the charge <b>transferring</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{electrode}} {{arrangement for}} electrohydrodynamic (EHD) enhancement {{of heat and}} mass transfer is disclosed. Electrodes of alternating polarity are embedded within a nonconductive heat <b>transfer</b> wall <b>material</b> and are connected to a high voltage source {{at either end of}} the heat <b>transfer</b> wall <b>material</b> where the heat <b>transfer</b> wall <b>material</b> passes through a tube sheet, fitting or other confinement. When voltage from the high voltage source is applied to the alternating electrodes, electric field gradients are created on both the interior and exterior heat transfer surfaces of the heat <b>transfer</b> wall <b>material.</b> Regions of intense electric field gradient reside in close proximity to both heat transfer surfaces, thus when nonconductive fluids pass over the heat transfer surfaces, bubbles are repelled from the regions of strong electric field gradients above the electrodes and additional fluid is attracted into these regions. The result is simultaneous augmentation of heat and mass transfer, particularly by evaporation and condensation, on both sides of the heat <b>transfer</b> wall <b>material.</b> Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

5000|$|Normally {{the heat}} {{transfer}} between airstreams {{provided by the}} device is termed as [...] "sensible heat", which is the exchange of energy, or enthalpy, resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content. However, if moisture or relative humidity levels in the return air stream are high enough to allow condensation {{to take place in}} the device, then this will cause [...] "latent heat" [...] to be released and the heat <b>transfer</b> <b>material</b> will be covered with a film of water. Despite a corresponding absorption of latent heat, as some of the water film is evaporated in the opposite airstream, the water will reduce the thermal resistance of the boundary layer of the heat exchanger material and thus improve the heat transfer coefficient of the device, and hence increase efficiency. The energy exchange of such devices now comprises both sensible and latent heat transfer; in addition to a change in temperature, there is also a change in moisture content of the exhaust air stream.|$|E
5000|$|A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a {{computer-controlled}} plotting {{device with}} a blade {{instead of a}} pen. A vector based design is created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths {{laid out in the}} design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well.The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colors of vinyl. A design with multiple colors must have each color cut separately and then layered {{on top of each other}} as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colors, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a standalone cutter. Despite the limitations in the design process, the durability of solid, cut vinyl and its resistance to fading far outweigh many negatives in common applications. Also, in addition to the capabilities of the cutter itself, the adhesive vinyl comes in a wide variety of colors and materials including gold and silver foil, vinyl that simulates frosted glass, holographic vinyl, reflective vinyl, thermal <b>transfer</b> <b>material,</b> and even clear vinyl imbedded with real 24 carat gold leaf!

The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.|$|E

The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has been over 22 % [6].
