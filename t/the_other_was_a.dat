The bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million.

Burnley won the East Lancashire Charity Cup, beating Blackburn Rovers 8–2 over two legs, but fared poorly in the Lancashire Senior Cup, losing to Manchester City. As league champions, Burnley qualified for the Charity Shield, in which they were beaten 0–2 by FA Cup winners Tottenham Hotspur. Burnley also played two friendly matches during the season.

5|$|As a {{promotion}} for the film, Warner Bros. Entertainment released , {{a series of}} narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase {{in the summer of}} 2008 on digital video stores, such as iTunes Store and Amazon Video on Demand. DC Direct released action figures based on the film in January 2009. Director Zack Snyder also set up a YouTube contest petitioning Watchmen fans to create faux commercials of products made by the fictional Veidt Enterprises. The producers also released two short video pieces online, which were intended to be viral videos designed as fictional backstory pieces, with one being a 1970 newscast marking the 10th anniversary of the public appearance of Dr. Manhattan. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> short propaganda film promoting the Keene Act of 1977, which made it illegal to be a superhero without government support. An official viral marketing web site, The New Frontiersman, is named after the tabloid magazine featured in the graphic novel, and contains teasers styled as declassified documents. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. DC Comics reissued Watchmen #1 for the original cover price of $1.50 on December 10, 2008; no other issues are to be reprinted.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was {{a modified version of the}} original route, bypassing Bihać and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> completely new route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E

White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov {{shook his head in}} disbelief.|$|E

5|$|Nine {{professional}} wrestling matches {{were scheduled}} for the event, which featured a supercard, a scheduling {{of more than one}} main bout. The first of these matches was a Singles match from the SmackDown brand that featured The Undertaker defeating World Heavyweight Champion Edge to win the title. The second was a Triple Threat match from the Raw brand, in which WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated challengers Triple H and John Cena to retain the championship. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> singles match from the ECW brand, in which Kane defeated ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero to win the ECW title. From the six scheduled bouts on the undercard, three received more promotion than the others. In a No Disqualification match, Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeated Big Show. The second match involved wrestlers from all three brands fighting in a Money in the Bank ladder match, which CM Punk won. The other match was a retirement match in which Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair, leading to Flair's departure from the WWE and a period of retirement from active wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Other {{visitors}} {{stayed to}} prospect for and mine deposits of copper, gold, lead, and silver. These sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment. In December 1903, two men from Ballarat were prospecting for silver. One was an out-of-work Irish miner named Jack Keane and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren. Quite by accident, Keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo's work site and named the claim the Keane Wonder Mine. This started a minor and short-lived gold rush into the area. The Keane Wonder Mine, along with mines at Rhyolite, Skidoo and Harrisburg, {{were the only}} ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile. Outright shams such as Leadfield also occurred, but most ventures quickly ended after a short series of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore (these mines now dot the entire area and are a significant hazard to anyone who enters them). The boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the 1900s (decade) but soon declined after the Panic of 1907.|$|E
5|$|Power and {{communications}} across Rodrigues {{and the island}} of Mauritius were crippled by the storm, with {{the entirety of the}} former and 90 percent of the latter losing electricity. For approximately ten hours, the country was cut off from the outside world, with all communications disrupted. About 50,000 of the nation's 280,000 telecommunication lines sustained serious damage, resulting in prolonged power outages. Repair crews estimated that it would take until January 27, nearly a week after the storm's passage, for power to be fully restored. Widespread areas also lost water on Mauritius. Schools across the region sustained significant damage and as a precautionary measure, all classes were canceled until January 29. Agriculture sustained considerable losses {{as a result of the}} storm. Approximately 15 metric tons of flour and 20 metric tons of rice were damaged and preliminary estimates for sugarcane losses across the island reached US$47 million. Property damage from the storm amounted to US$50 million, and there were four deaths on the island; three were caused by traffic accidents, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man who died while making storm preparations.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} storm {{of the season}} was Cyclonic Storm Hibaru, which formed southeast of Sri Lanka in January. After nearly five months of inactivity, two depressions formed {{toward the end of}} June on opposite sides of India. The depression in the Arabian Sea was one of only two in that body of water during the year, the other of which formed in September and killed 13people. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> depression that formed over land and killed 26people in Madhya Pradesh, followed by another depression in July that killed one person. A series of deadly storms affected southeastern India beginning in September; a depression killed six people in Madhya Pradesh, Cyclonic Storm Pyarr killed 80people, an unclassified tropical storm killed 16people in nearby Bangladesh, and a deep depression in October killed 100people in Andhra Pradesh. December was active, with cyclonic storms Baaz and Fanoos hitting southern India, resulting in 11fatalities, and a deep depression remaining over waters {{in the middle of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|The {{landing craft}} used {{included}} twelve actual World War II examples, 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs, standing {{in for the}} British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord. The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect {{of blood in the}} seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in operating condition. The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional, Soviet T-34 tanks. The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers. One was created for the film using the chassis of a Czech-built Panzer 38(t) tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m/43 assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December {{on the western side}} of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E
