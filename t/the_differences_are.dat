5|$|There {{are several}} {{subspecies}} differing in plumage shade or size, although <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> clinal, and races interbreed where their ranges meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} is monotypic, lacking any subspecies. Birds {{in the south}} east of New Guinea are {{sometimes}} separated into a proposed subspecies, P. d. monticola, but <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> very slight and the supposed subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{recognised}} subspecies, although <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> mainly clinal; birds become {{smaller and}} paler {{in the east}} of the range and the males have larger white wing spots. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the subspecies' ranges overlap.|$|E
50|$|Subtraction is {{the inverse}} of addition. Subtraction finds <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between two numbers, the minuend minus the subtrahend. If the minuend {{is larger than}} <b>the</b> subtrahend, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> positive; if <b>the</b> minuend is smaller than <b>the</b> subtrahend, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> negative; if they <b>are</b> equal, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> 0.|$|R
30|$|The A values {{greater than}} 0 {{indicated}} that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in intra-group <b>is</b> {{greater than that}} in inter-group, but less than 0 represented that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in inter-group <b>is</b> greater than that in intra-group. Observe-delta value is smaller which indicates that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> small within groups, and the Expect-delta value is greater which indicates that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> great between groups. The significance value below 0.05 indicate that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> significant.|$|R

5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to termite attack; <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman {{speakers}} are {{conscious of}} {{a distinction between}} two dialects of Wagiman, which they refer to as matjjin no-roh-ma 'light language' and matjjin gu-nawutj-jan 'heavy language'. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> minor and speakers have no difficulty understanding one another.|$|E
5|$|Matheos {{suggested}} {{using an}} altered {{version of the}} United States passport for the album's cover art. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> that the arrows are double-headed, the olive branch is wilted, and the eagle's wings have been clipped. Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against sending out promotional copies of the album before its release date {{in order to prevent}} an early Internet leak of it. The album was released in Europe on February 17, 2003.|$|E
40|$|In this study, by cluster simple random sampling, the {{prevalence}} of ectopic of first permanent molar in 8 years old Tehran school children is considered and determined as 0. 87 percent The involvement of maxilla was more than mandible and <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> significant.

5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography {{focused upon}} morphology: the same derivational affix would {{be written in}} the same way in {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} {{has nine}} subspecies, although <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> small and change gradually across the range. The subspecies are sometimes treated as three {{groups based on}} close similarities in morphology, habitat usage, and vocalizations. These groups cover eastern North America, the Great Basin and central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions. The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern S. c. carolinensis has the palest back. The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. The calls {{of the three groups}} differ, as described above. The Great Basin and Eastern forms have been observed in secondary contact on the Great Plains, where they do not seem to mix.|$|E
5|$|Type C: This Mini {{connector}} {{is smaller}} than the type A plug, measuring 10.42mm × 2.42mm but has the same 19-pin configuration. It is intended for portable devices. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> that all positive signals of the differential pairs are swapped with their corresponding shield, the DDC/CEC Ground is assigned to pin 13 instead of pin 17, the CEC is assigned to pin 14 instead of pin 13, and the reserved pin is 17 instead of pin 14. The type C Mini connector can be connected to a type A connector using a type A-to-type C cable.|$|E

5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In Birmingham, 60.4% of the {{population}} was aged between 16-74, compared to 66.7% in England as a whole. There are generally more females than males in each single year of age, except for the youngest ages (0–18) and late-30s and late-50s. Females represented 51.6% of {{the population}} whilst men represented 48.4%. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> most marked in the oldest age group reflecting greater female longevity, where more women were 70 or over. The bulge around the early-20s is due largely to students coming to the city's universities. Children around age ten are a relatively small group, reflecting the decline in birth rates {{around the turn of the}} century. There is a large group of children under the age of five which reflecting high numbers of births in recent years. Births are up 20% since 2001, increasing from 14,427 to 17,423 in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Some {{differences}} are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy: most notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area. However most of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> subtle {{changes in the}} connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons.|$|E
25|$|The {{minimum and}} maximum are 159.6 and 187.6 we can group them as follows {{rounding}} the numbers down. The class size (CS) is 3. The assumed mean is {{the centre of}} the range from 174 to 177 which is 175.5. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> counted in classes.|$|E
25|$|Since {{mutation}} rate is relatively constant, roughly {{one half of}} these changes occurred in the human lineage. Only a very tiny fraction of those fixed differences {{gave rise to the}} different phenotypes of humans and chimpanzees and finding those is a great challenge. The vast majority of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> neutral and do not affect the phenotype.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>difference</b> {{in quality}} <b>is</b> often {{reinforced}} by {{a difference in}} length (but <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> contrastive in final closed syllables). The exact distribution of the two vowels varies greatly from speaker to speaker.|$|R

25|$|There {{is clear}} {{empirical}} evidence for structural and functional {{differences in the}} brains of people who stutter. Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument {{that at least some}} of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> not a consequence of stuttering.|$|E
25|$|Co-Counselling International (CCI) {{was started}} in 1974 as a {{breakaway}} from Re-evaluation Counseling by John Heron, {{who was at the}} time director of the Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey UK, and Tom Sargent and Dency Sargent from Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Unlike other breakaways from RC, which involved changes of leadership but otherwise continued to practice in similar ways to RC, the CCI break was ideological, and CCI developed in significantly different ways. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> in practice, theory and organisation.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> {{much more}} {{pronounced}} in vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly {{higher than that of}} protium. In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.|$|E
