5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in {{the top half of the}} table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the top half of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E
5|$|York mostly {{occupied}} {{the bottom half}} of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> the turn of the year, and dropped as low as 23rd in September 2013. During February 2014 the team broke into {{the top half of the}} table and with one match left were in sixth-place. York's defensive record was the third best in League Two with 41 goals conceded, bettered only by Southend (39) and Chesterfield (40). Davies made the highest number of appearances over the season, appearing in 47 of York's 52 matches. Fletcher was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Jarvis with nine goals.|$|E
5|$|Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club {{secretary}} in 1911, {{and when the}} First World War broke out {{he took over the}} managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept them in the First Division, albeit in the lower half of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>before</b> former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager.|$|E

5|$|York made a {{good start}} to 1993–94, before a series of poor results saw them slip to 17th place in late November 1993. They only lost five of their last 30 {{fixtures}} to finish the season fifth in the Second Division table—their highest league placing since 1976. They lost to Stockport County in the play-off semi-final, being beaten 1–0 in the second leg at Edgeley Park after drawing 0–0 {{at home in the}} first leg. York were in lower midtable {{for the first half of}} 1994–95, but improving form saw them move up <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>before</b> finishing in ninth place. They struggled through most of 1995–96, and only avoided relegation by winning their last match away to Brighton & Hove Albion; they finished in 20th place. This season saw York record a 4–3 aggregate victory over Manchester United in the League Cup second round. York defeated a strong United team including some younger players 3–0 at Old Trafford in the first leg; in the second leg, United fielded some more experienced players, and despite losing 3–1, York progressed on aggregate. United went on to win the Premier League and FA Cup double. York finished 20th in 1996–97, only securing safety in the penultimate match with an away win over Rotherham United. For the second consecutive season, they eliminated Premier League opponents from the League Cup in the second round, with a 4–3 aggregate win over Everton. After drawing the first leg 1–1 at Goodison Park, York progressed after winning the second leg 3–2 at home. In mid December 1997, York were fourth in the table, but declining form after New Year saw them finish 1997–98 in 16th place.|$|E
5|$|York started 1976–77 poorly, {{and they}} were in the bottom two of the Third Division for most {{of the first half of}} the season. The midseason signings Chris Galvin and Gordon Staniforth marked an {{improvement}} in results, but after winning only one of their last 15 matches they finished in bottom place and were relegated for the second successive season. The 1977–78 season also started poorly; York lost seven of their opening 12 matches, leaving them 17th in the table. McGuinness was dismissed in October 1977 and was succeeded the following month by Charlie Wright, a former Charlton Athletic player. York remained in the lower reaches of the table and finished the season in 22nd place, forcing the club to apply for re-election for the sixth time. This was successful, as the club polled the maximum number of votes. This season, attendances fell to an all-time low, and amid growing financial trouble, Michael Sinclair took over as chairman in April 1978 in a boardroom shuffle. Results improved in 1978–79; York finished 10th in the Fourth Division and reached the FA Cup fourth round. They played reigning First Division champions and European Cup winners-elect Nottingham Forest, and were beaten 3–1 at the City Ground. In 1979–80, York were consistently in the lower reaches of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>before</b> finishing 17th. With the club 18th in the table by mid March 1980, Wright was dismissed. Youth coach Barry Lyons succeeded him, initially as caretaker manager, before being appointed permanently in May 1980.|$|E

Snary's bowling was less effective in terms of containment than before – he conceded runs at more than two per over – and he took only 23 wickets, playing in around half the team's games.

After the World Championship, King {{dropped out of the}} {{automatic}} qualifying places for the 2011 Premier League Darts, and was not awarded a wildcard. His successful streak in the Players Championship Finals continued as he again reached the semi-final for the second consecutive year. He lost in the semi-final to Phil Taylor 8–10. He lost in the third round of the 2011 UK Open tournament, losing 9–5 to Mark Walsh. He successfully qualified for the 2011 World Matchplay Darts as the 9th seed., but lost 6–10 against Justin Pipe in the first round, reporting a complaint of tennis elbow. At the 2011 European Championship, he beat Co Stompé 6–1 in the first round, before losing 3–10 to Taylor in the second round. He also qualified for the 2011 Championship League Darts winner's group by beating Simon Whitlock 6–3 in the final of group five. In the winner's group finished second in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> losing to Paul Nicholson in the semi-final. At the Players Championship Finals in December, he beat Colin Lloyd 6–4 to meet Phil Taylor in the second round. King produced his second victory over Taylor in major competitions with an 8–5 win. However, he lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winner Kevin Painter.|$|E
500|$|However, Taylor criticised Neilson for {{his lack}} of fitness, {{and as a result}} the winger did not feature in any of the {{following}} three games and was instead loaned out to Cambridge United initially on a month-long loan to act as cover for Antonio Murray and Robbie Willmott, who were suspended and injured respectively. He capped his debut for Cambridge United on 6 March 2010 against Barrow by scoring the only goal of the game to give his new side a 1–0 victory. After scoring another two goals, Cambridge extended Neilson's loan with manager Martin Ling saying he would [...] "assess the situation in the summer". He played in all 14 of Cambridge's games during his loan spell and scored three goals helping them finish in the top-half of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> he returned to Bradford {{at the end of the}} Conference Premier season.|$|E

The Crusaders' seven players in the programme was more than any other New Zealand Super 14 franchise. The Crusaders players were Chris Jack, Richie McCaw, Greg Somerville, Reuben Thorne, Dan Carter, Leon MacDonald, and Aaron Mauger. All but one of the seven returned to play for the Crusaders in their eighth round match against the Stormers (Greg Somerville did not return due to injury). The Crusaders climbed to second on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> defeating the Western Force 53–0 at Jade Stadium in the tenth round.

Not to sit down to <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> the domestic animals have been fed is a lesson derived from Deut. xi. 15.
