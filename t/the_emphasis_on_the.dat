5|$|The Gododdin, {{known in}} Roman times as the Votadini, held territories {{in what is}} now {{southeast}} Scotland and Northumberland, part of the Hen Ogledd (Old North). The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
5|$|The console {{versions}} of Arkham Knight received positive reviews from critics, particularly for its narrative, visuals, gameplay, combat, and world designs, with most criticism given to <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Batmobile. The Windows version, however, became {{the subject of}} intense criticism due to major performance problems, even on high-end graphics hardware, prompting Warner Bros. to temporarily withdraw it from sale. Upon its release, the game was the fastest selling game of 2015, and the fastest selling game in the Arkham series, reaching over 5 million units sold globally by October 2015. Rocksteady released additional content for the game, including story-driven missions, challenge maps, and skins for Batman and his allies, as well as new Batmobiles from Batman's history and custom racetracks for them.|$|E

5|$|Haynes {{returned}} to Assam in June 1943, to organize for Bissell the Assam-American Air Base Command (AAABC) which he led as a mixed force composed primarily of Tenth Air Force units with {{some elements of}} the Fourteenth Air Force. Haynes was tasked with coordinating area defense and offensive destruction of the enemy, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> former. For the first two months, Haynes was given fewer officers and men than he deemed necessary, and the AAABC made little headway in its mission. In mid-August, large-scale re-organization of Allied forces in Asia resulted in the AAABC being renamed the , and placed under George E. Stratemeyer. Haynes led the group until September 1943, when he {{returned to}} the U.S. after 18 months in Asia. Before he left, he told American reporters that his forces had helped deny the port of Rangoon to the enemy, and helped soften Burma for invasion. He stated that the highlight of his time in Asia was the air raid against Hong Kong. After his upcoming air crossing of the Atlantic, his eighth such, Haynes said that the first thing he intended to do was look up his 14-year-old son in high school and his wife who was working in the drafting department at Sperry in Garden City, New York.|$|E

25|$|The {{tempo of}} reggae is usually slower than ska but faster than rocksteady. It is this slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third beat, {{and the use}} of syncopated, melodic bass lines that {{differentiate}} reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.|$|E

25|$|A {{corollary}} to <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front {{was a lack}} {{of troops}} for the Eastern Front against Russia. In the east the Germans planned a defensive strategy and relied on the Austro-Hungarian Army (Landstreitkräfte Österreich-Ungarns/Császári és Királyi Hadsereg) to divert the Russians from East Prussia, while France was crushed. Divisions from the German army in the west (Westheer) would be redeployed to the East to deal with the Russians as soon as a breathing-space was gained against the French.|$|E

25|$|Jainism prescribes {{a path of}} non-violence to {{progress}} the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.|$|E
25|$|Frank Goodwin and his {{brothers}} developed most of the core Market buildings.

Upon his retirement in 1925, his nephew Arthur Goodwin took over most of the Market ownership, selling some shares to people outside of the family.|$|E
25|$|The Western {{tradition}} of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is {{widely seen as}} producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith.

Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished art works.|$|E

25|$|Batsmen are {{required}} to retire upon reaching a pre-agreed personal score, usually 25 or 30. Should the side be dismissed {{with a number of}} batsmen retired, they may then return to the crease in the order they retired. It is not unprecedented for a batsman to retire for a second or even third time in one innings. This rule ensures that the majority of a team will get a bat, and hence ensures <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire team both getting involved and being able to contribute to the final score.|$|E
25|$|The Bhakti {{movement}} {{began with}} <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> worship of God, regardless of one's status – whether priestly or laypeople, men or women, higher social status or lower social status. The movements were mainly {{centered on the}} forms of Vishnu (Rama and Krishna) and Shiva. There were however popular devotees of this era of Durga. The best-known devotees are the Nayanars from southern India. The most popular Shaiva teacher of the south was Basava, while of the north it was Gorakhnath. Female saints include figures like Akkamadevi, Lalleshvari and Molla.|$|E
25|$|Without {{calling into}} {{question}} {{the value of the}} preceding analyses, the third interpretation, which comes from an Assumptionist systematic theologian, Fr. George Tavard (19222007), a Frenchman living in the United States, places <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deeply Trinitarian inspiration of d’Alzon’s writings, articulated around themes and actions which champion the rights of God. This undeniable aspect does not appear to us to invalidate the others because, on the one hand, d’Alzon was influenced by the Christocentric thought of his day and because, on the other hand, Fr. Tavard speaks more on or about Fr. d’Alzon than from Fr. d’Alzon himself.|$|E

The conference paper is focused on several particular cases with <b>the</b> <b>emphases</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> activity of the National Administration of Property Assets and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> different approach to the restitution (emigrants, Jews with German nationality and so-called repatriates) ...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> net scrip of co-op members, which {{equal the}} amount {{injected}} into the co-op by the administration, is the distinguishing feature of the Chartalist view. From this perspective, the function of introducing lending, as Krugman suggests, is that interest on this lending creates or destroys net member savings. For example, if the administration lends ten hours worth of scrip at 10% interest for one year (thus collecting eleven hours worth of scrip in one year's time), then it has created ten hours worth of scrip but will withdraw eleven hours in the future, thus reducing net private sector assets by one hour.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oral {{qualities of}} {{traditional}} story telling are {{also evident in}} this short story. The narrator is telling us about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those who have access to this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
25|$|After the dreadfully {{desultory}} affair at the Sydney Football Stadium {{a fortnight}} before, the ten-try bonanza {{turned on by}} the two sides at Ballymore was a timely reminder that running rugby, with <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> players and not the whistle, was what the public wanted. Welsh referee Clive Norling had given only thirteen penalties, ensuring the continuity needed by sides with the attacking flair of France and Australia. A close study of the video replay shows that Norling made at least six major mistakes, five of which led to points being scored. Nevertheless he was hailed as a hero for his willingness to let the players be the stars.|$|E
