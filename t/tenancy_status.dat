40|$|In {{my thesis}} paper I have studied {{different}} factors shaping {{the housing market}} trends in Slovenia. An online-survey-based analysis of housing preferences has been performed, classifying the respondents into three categories based {{on the type of}} their household type, their head householder and the current residential status. I have also carefully considered their views of different factors influencing the resolution of residential issues, subduing them to comparison and evaluation. Furthermore, I have researched the acceptability of the <b>tenancy</b> and owner-occupancy <b>statuses</b> amongst Slovenes, as well as elaborated on their advantages and disadvantages. Factors most commonly decisive with one's residential status are: housing prices, income, permanent employment, household size, neighbourhood, accessibility of city centres as well as sufficient privacy and the feeling of safety. The majority of respondents have given more importance to non-commercial factors, however, the price often plays a crucial role in making the final decision. A great number of survey participants have voiced their ambition for estate ownership, thus considering all other forms merely temporary solutions. The key motive behind it is free and independent decision-making as well as arranging of the owned dwelling. Nonetheless, they do admit to certain advantages of tenancy and consider it a relatively equivalent substitute to ownership. The results of the study show that many households resolve their residential issue by settling in an independent or shared dwelling of either one's own or partner's parents...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} found that supporting formerly homeless people and those {{at risk of}} homelessness into public housing in Western Australia reduced their use of health services {{as well as the}} frequency with which they did so. The reduction in health service use, which was particularly evident for hospital stays and psychiatric care, could save WA $ 4, 846 per person per year for a total of $ 16. 4 million per year. This increases to $ 84, 135 per person per year for clients of the NPAH Mental Health program. 	The study used linked health service and public housing data to examine the impact of public housing on health service utilisation and health system costs pre- and post-housing for 3, 383 public housing tenants from five NPAH programs in Western Australia (983 who received NPAH support and 2, 400 who were priority housing tenants). The linked data was complemented by a survey a small group of 277 current WA public housing tenants (93 who received NPAH support and 185 who were priority housing tenants) which examined their history of homelessness, the levels of support received before and after being housed, their confidence in maintaining their <b>tenancy,</b> self-reported health <b>status</b> and health service use. 	Average cost of providing support under NPAH programs is $ 6, 462 per person per year, compared with cost offsets of $ 13, 276 per person per year. 	The results suggest that sustaining a tenancy for over 12 months is crucial to achieving health service reductions and cost savings. 	Providing stable housing with support improves health outcomes as well as housing outcomes and consequently reduces health care costs.

40|$|In all European countries, migrant populations {{tend to have}} worse living {{conditions}} than native; {{this is particularly true}} for those born outside the EU.

To examine differences in economic integration of foreigners, the paper documents deprivation differentials across groups of foreigners. In particular, we measure differences in material deprivation between groups of foreigners once we control for the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of each group using a flexible standardization methodology. Our results show that, in Italy, foreigners from African and Mediterranean countries and to a lesser extend from South Asia are most deprived and that the construction of the counterfactual distributions (considering age, gender, household composition, education, labor market position, household income, <b>tenancy</b> <b>status</b> and integration) only marginally explain the gap between different foreigner groups...|$|E
40|$|In the 'rice-wheat' and the 'cotton-wheat' farming {{systems of}} Pakistan's Punjab, late {{planting}} of wheat is a perennial problem due to often delayed harvesting {{of the previously}} planted and late maturing rice and cotton crops. This leaves very limited time for land preparation for 'on-time' planting of wheat. 'No-tillage' technologies that reduce the turn-round time for wheat cultivation after rice and cotton have been developed, but their uptake {{has not been as}} expected. -This paper attempts to determine the farm and farmer characteristics and other socio-economic factors that influence the adoption of 'no-tillage' technologies'. Logit models were developed for the analysis undertaken. In the 'cotton-wheat' system personal characteristics like education, <b>tenancy</b> <b>status,</b> attitude towards risk implied in the use of new technologies and contact with extension agents are the main factors that affect adoption. As regards the 'rice-wheat' system, resource endowments such as farm size, access to a 'no-tillage' drill, clayey soils and the area sown to the rice-wheat sequence along with tenancy and contact with extension agents were dominant in explaining adoption.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} agricultural contracts using a transaction costs approach. We contend that {{in a context of}} modern agriculture, with well defined property rights, agricultural contracts must balance costs and benefits, aligning tenant and landlord incentives towards a similar objective. The study debates the potential effects of <b>tenancy</b> <b>status</b> and duration of contracts, over soil conservation and input use. We present empirical evidence about the effects over the soil and input use in tenant (fixed rent or sharecropping) and owner-operator farms using farm level data from the 2002 National Agricultural Census of Argentina. The empirical results show some differential effects but do not support a general and clear negative effect for tenancy arrangements. Our intuition is that the interaction among specific characteristics of farmers (education, experience, assets, etc.), the natural resources endowment (soil fertility) and the economic and institutional environment (labor markets, monitoring costs, property rights, rule of law etc.) are more important factors than the land tenancy or contract type itself.

40|$|This paper uses {{extensive}} micro-level {{data from}} Argentine agriculture circa 1880 - 1914 to explore various hypotheses {{relating to the}} supposed unusual and favored position enjoyed by the owner-operated large scale estates (latifundia) on the pampas as compared to small-scale units operated by cash tenants and sharecroppers. I have access to several data sets which allow me to explore whether tenancy and scale mattered as determinants of technique and efficiency in the rural estates of Buenos Aires province {{at the turn of}} the century, and I obtain some surprising results. Tenants did not seem disadvantaged in terms of access to land. Accumulation of land in and of itself produced no direct gain in terms of augmented land prices (due to say, scale economies or monopoly power). And <b>tenancy</b> <b>status</b> appears to have mattered very little as a determinant of investment choices. I conclude that the case against the latifundia, and the pessimistic conventional view of tenant farming on the pampas rests, at present, on little firm quantitative evidence. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this essay}} I analyse the {{transitions}} {{experienced by the}} Hos of Kolhan (in Singhbhum district of Chotanagpur) under colonial rule. Despite similarities, Ho village organization was distinct in many ways {{from that of the}} other adivasi groups, including the Mundas whom they resembled most closely. Under colonial rule these specificities, particularly those related to <b>tenancy</b> <b>status</b> of the Hos, tended to become more distinct, leading to shifts and repositionings within the internal community organization on the one hand, together with the reassessment of the Ho community’s relationship with ‘alien’ outsiders on the other. Such changes, moreover, occurred in a context when new British legislations attempted simultaneously to weave together the contradictory principles of exceptionalism and homogenization. This essay seeks to investigate into the Ho social organization and trace the changes that it experienced under colonial rule. It focuses on three specific aspects of this transition, namely the co-opting of thevillage leadership, the mankis and the mundas within the new governance {{and its impact on the}} village society, the negotiations of the Hos with the new tenancy legislations, and the redefinition of their relationships with various non-tribal ‘outsider’ groups...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines measurement {{problems caused}} by imperfect data and productivity issues in a microeconometric framework. The empirical work is done on a panel of 384 farmers in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the period extending from 1979 - 84. The farmers use modern, labor and traditional inputs towards the production of two broad categories of outputs: crops and livestock. The first goal is to study estimation methods of agricultural input demand systems {{in the light of}} imperfect data and compare the consequences of not taking data quality into account versus when they are. These problems are addressed using techniques that include discrete choice models and virtual price methods. The second goal is to measure and examine the productivity of farmers and investigate the sources for existing variations in efficiencies. This is done using Stochastic Frontier Analysis methods and Data Envelopment Analysis. Besides the estimation of efficiency scores, investigating the effects of <b>tenancy</b> <b>status</b> and input-use on productivity are also addressed. The final goal is to link the above treatments empirically. This is done by examining the degree of misspecification that might arise from a failure to include the efficiency measures in the estimation of demand systems...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} a global {{environmental}} threat to all economic sectors, particularly the agricultural sector. Pakistan {{is one of the}} countries negatively affected by climate change due to its high exposure to extreme events and low adaptive capacity. In Pakistan, farmers are the primary stakeholders in agriculture and are more at risk due to climate vulnerability. Based on farm household data from 450 households collected from three districts in three agroecological zones in the Punjab province of Pakistan, this study examines how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt their farming in response to perceived changes in climate. The results demonstrate that awareness of climate change is widespread throughout the area, and farm households make adjustments to adapt their agriculture in response to climatic change. Overall 58 % of the farm households adapted their farming to climate change. Changing crop varieties, changing planting dates, planting of shade trees and changing fertilizers were the main adaptation methods implemented by farm households in the study area. The results from the binary logistic model reveal that education, farm experience, household size, land area, <b>tenancy</b> <b>status,</b> ownership of a tube well, access to market information, information on weather forecasting and agricultural extension services all influence farmers' choices of adaptation measures. The results also indicate that adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of information, lack of money, resource constraints and shortage of irrigation water in the study area. Findings of the study suggest the need for greater investment in farmer education and improved institutional setup for climate change adaptation to improve farmers' wellbeing...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{identify}} the economic competencies needed and possessed by farmers in Hyderabad District, Sind, Pakistan;The target population for this study consisted of 97 randomly selected farmers and 26 agriculture officers in Hyderabad District, Sind, Pakistan. Thirty-seven competency statements constituted the economic competence portion of the questionnaire. Sections on demographic variables and sources of information used by farmers were also included. A 1 - 5 point response scale was used to assess the degree of competence needed and the degree of competence possessed by the farmers included in the study. The data were collected through personal interviews with the respondents. In analyzing the data, descriptive statistical procedures were used;The findings show that farmers possess low economic competence, whereas they need high competence as identified by themselves and agriculture officers. As perceived by respondents, a significant difference at the 0. 01 level existed between the level of competence needed and possessed by farmers for all economic competencies included in the study. There was no significant difference in the overall mean for the economic competencies needed and possessed as perceived by farmers when grouped by years of farming experience. When farmers were grouped by educational level, significant differences were observed for several competencies. Farmers with a high school education or more tended to rate competencies significantly higher than farmers with lower levels of education;The level needed and the level possessed for most of the economic competencies were significantly different at the 0. 01 level when farmers were grouped by <b>tenancy</b> <b>status.</b> The owner-landlord group rated most competencies significantly higher than the owner-operator, tenant and owner-tenant groups;It was recommended that all economic competencies should be incorporated in the Baccalaureate and M.

40|$|The Kaghan Valley {{is in the}} {{territorial}} jurisdiction of Mansehera District, named after a tiny village Kaghan, {{at the end of}} the valley. The valley culminates in the tree-clad high mountains and glaciers in the North-East with varying altitudes from 1 to 5 thousand meter s above sea level. The region is relatively active geophysically, hydrologically and biologi cally diverse by virtue of the altitude and aspect-driven variability in energy and moisture. In such region a better un derstanding of changes in land resources, production of agronomic and horticultural crops, use of timber and non-timber products, and livestock structure/composition have important implications and understanding these changes along with the indigenous knowledge of mountain people which, is key to sustainable development of the Himalayan region. Our results showed that the main causes of lowest agriculture production in the area are poor crop management in context of the mountains, drought spells, low soil fertility, land fragmentation and <b>tenancy</b> <b>status</b> of the agricultural land. Off season vegetables cultivation on the sloppy land leads to sever soil erosion and soil land degradation of this mountain ecosystem. Overgrazing during the summer season is another problem as the pastures are visited both by the Afghan and local nomads without relating with carrying capacity of the alpine meadows. The overgrazed soil is usually subject to rainfalls and sever e soil erosion. Any use of resources of such fragile rare high mountain ecosystem requires a great sense of responsibility but in this case the forest resources are being plundered and are used roughly. We recommend adequate use of agricultural inputs, specific crop management practices for mountain agriculture. Local social welfare organizations should work to create awareness about the sustainable use of natural resources. The government should resolve the ownership problem of land as common property keeping in mind the customary laws of the region to make sure the involvement of all stakeholders. </p...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{investigation}} {{of the impact of}} institutional and socioeconomic factors on agricultural productivity and natural resource conditions is important for an informed evaluation of current policies, and to identify areas for future improvements. In this line, the current study addresses three topics of relevance to the process of agricultural intensification and natural resource management {{in the context of the}} less-favoured Highlands of Tigray, Ethiopia. The first topic assesses the impact of land contracting, in the form of sharecropping, on plot level crop and land management input use and intensity of use decisions, and the efficiency of resource use by tenants on their own and on sharecropped-in plots. Controlling for other socio-economic and biophysical factors, contrary to the predictions of the Marshallin theory of sharecropping, the study finds no statistically significant impact of <b>tenancy</b> <b>status</b> on input use and resource use efficiency at plot level. The second topic focuses on understanding of farmers' perceptions of rainfall-related production risk and uncertainty in the study area, and investigates how that influences their decisions on the intensity of plot level farm management input use and investment in land management. The findings show that farmers differ highly in their production risk perceptions even they face similar external circumstances and their socioeconomic features are found to account for such differences. Farm management input use and labour investment in land management by farmers did not show statistically significant associations with the risk perception of farm decision-makers. The third topic assesses the effectiveness of the household level labour quota system as a collective resource management institution employed in Tigray, and seeks to identify the household level factors that explain the degree of farmers' (non) -compliance with the system. The results from this assessment indicate the need for adapting the system to the changing socioeconomic circumstances of the households, and creating functional decentralized systems of resource management, considering the economic objectives of the human element. Overall, farmers' decisions on plot level farm management and investment for land improvement, and compliance with collective action institutions are influenced by their socioeconomic and institutional circumstances that require policy consideration. Therefore, policy interventions are necessary to alleviate major constraints for efficient resource use, create production risk management services, and promote self-sustaining systems of communal resource management in the region...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} project {{was carried out}} at the Agricultural Research Institute, Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, which is situated at 31 oN and 71 oE with elevation of 174 m from sea level. Research trials were conducted {{on the effects of}} agro-climatic conditions of Dera Ismail Khan on potato bulking rate, weed control in potato using different strategies and performance of several varieties/clones in autumn season. Before going into field trials, a survey research was carried out from 50 vegetable growers in Dera Ismail Khan District to assess the knowledge of growers and to uncover the reasons of low or no potato production in the area. Age, education level, <b>tenancy</b> <b>status,</b> land holding and gender status of the sampled population were also assessed. Results revealed that only 8 % possessed little knowledge of potato production. Major barriers in potato production appeared to be lack of scientific knowledge, weed and pest problems, nutritional management, un-availability of high yielding varieties, seed source and potato harvesting time. Almost 100 % of the growers were unaware of the potato varieties, stage of harvest and pest control. Exact sowing time was not known to 92 % of the sampled population. Knowledge of weed and nutritional management in potato crop was completely unknown to 98 % respondents. First set of field trials was conducted to optimize the sowing date and crop growth period of potato during autumn 2003 and 2004. Total number of stems increased with the delay in planting in both years. Total numbers of tubers per unit area and percentage of large sized tubers (> 55 mm) were highest at earliest planting. Smaller tubers (< 35 mm) increased with delay in planting and small sized tubers were maximum at sowing date Oct. 24 in 2003 and at sowing date Oct. 15 in 2004. Total tuber yield was also higher at earlier planting (Oct. 03, 2003 and Sep. 24, 2004) as compared to planting at later dates. However, dry matter was higher at delayed planting. Plant dry bio-mass was higher by planting the potato earlier at Oct. 03, 2003 and Sep. 24, 2004. Harvesting potato at various intervals also significantly affected these parameters. Total number of tubers, percent larger and medium sized tubers, tuber yield and plant dry bio-mass increased with the delay in harvesting in both years. However dry matter in tuber was found higher at earlier harvestings. Another experiment was carried out to select the best weed control strategy for autumn grown potato. All the weed management plots produced significantly higher percentage of large tubers. While leaving the weeds throughout the season (Weedycheck) resulted in maximum percentage of small tubers; controlling the weed chemically or manually significantly improved the marketable yield as compared to weedy-check. Significantly lower population of weeds was recorded in weedcontrolled plots at the end of growing season. At the end of growing season weeds found in weedy-check were; Anagallis arvensis (47. 54 % in year- 1 and 39. 56 % in year- 2), Cyperus rotundus (13. 11 % and 18. 68 %), Convolvulus arvensis (9. 84 % and 12. 09 %), Chenopodium album (6. 56 % and 6. 59 %), Rumex dentatus (3. 28 % and 4. 40 %), Cynodon dactylon (6. 56 % and 6. 59 %) and Meliotus indica (13. 11 % and 12. 09 %) in a two years study.

40|$|Despite {{being an}} {{indicator}} of modernization and macro-economic growth, urbanization in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa is tightly interwoven with poverty and deprivation. This has manifested physically as slums, which represent the worst residential urban areas, marked by {{lack of access to}} good quality housing and basic services. To effectively combat the slum phenomenon, local slum conditions must be captured in quantitative and spatial terms. However, there are significant hurdles to this. Slum detection and mapping requires readily available and reliable data, as well as a proper conceptualization of measurement and scale. Using Bamenda, Cameroon, as a test case, this dissertation research was designed as a three-pronged attack on the slum mapping problematic. The overall goal was to investigate locally optimized slum mapping strategies and methods that utilize high resolution satellite image data, household survey data, simple machine learning and regionalization theory. The first major objective {{of the study was to}} tackle a 2 ̆ 2 measurement 2 ̆ 2 problem. The aim was to explore a multi-index approach to measure and map local slum conditions. The rationale behind this was that prior sub-Saharan slum research too often used simplified measurement techniques such as a single unweighted composite index to represent diverse local slum conditions. In this study six household indicators relevant to the United Nations criteria for defining slums were extracted from a 2013 Bamenda household survey data set and aggregated for 63 local statistical areas. The extracted variables were the percent of households having the following attributes: more than two residents per room, non-owner, occupying a single room or studio, having no flush toilet, having no piped water, having no drainage. Hierarchical variable clustering was used as a surrogate for exploratory factor analysis to determine fewer latent slum factors from these six variables. Variable groups were classified such that the most correlated variables fell in the same group while non-correlated variables fell in separate groups. Each group membership was then examined to see if the group suggested a conceptually meaningful slum factor which could quantified as a stand-alone 2 ̆ 2 high 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 low 2 ̆ 2 binary slum index. Results showed that the slum indicators in the study area could be replaced by at least two meaningful and statistically uncorrelated latent factors. One factor reflected the home occupancy conditions (<b>tenancy</b> <b>status,</b> overcrowded and living space conditions) and was quantified using K-means clustering of units as an ‘occupancy disadvantage index’ (Occ_D). The other reflected the state of utilities access (piped water and flush toilet) and was quantified as utilities disadvantage index (UT_D). Location attributes were used to examine/validate both indices. Independent t-tests showed that units with high Occ_D were on average closer to nearest town markets and major roads when compared with units of low Occ_D. This was consistent with theory as it is expected that typical slum residents (in this case overcrowded and non-owner households) will favor accessibility to areas of high economic activity. However, this situation was not the same with UT_D as shown by lack of such as a strong pattern. The second major objective was to tackle a 2 ̆ 2 learning 2 ̆ 2 problem. The purpose was to explore the potential of unsupervised machine learning to detect or 2 ̆ 2 learn 2 ̆ 2 slum conditions from image data. The rationale was that such an approach would be efficient, less reliant on prior knowledge and expertise. A 2012 GeoEye image scene of the study area was subjected to image classification from which the following physical settlement attributes were quantified for each of the 63 statistical areas: per cent roof area, percent open space area, per cent bare soil, per cent paved road surface, per cent dirt road surface, building shadow-roof area ratio. The shadow-roof ratio was an innovative measure used to capture the size and density attributes of buildings. In addition to the 6 image derived variables, the mean slope of each area was calculated from a digital elevation dataset. All 7 attributes were subject to principal component analysis from which the first 2 components were extracted and used for hierarchical clustering of statistical areas to derive physical types. Results show that area units could be optimally classified into 4 physical types labelled generically as Categories 1 – 4, each with at least one defining physical characteristic. Kruskal Wallis tests comparing physical types in terms of household and locations attributes showed that at least two physical types were different in terms of aggregated household slum conditions and location attributes. Category 4 areas, located on steep slopes and having high shadow-to-roof ratio, had the highest distribution of non-owner households. They were also located close to nearest town markets. They were thus the most likely candidates of slums in the city. Category 1 units on other hand located at the outskirts and having abundant open space were least likely to have slum conditions. The third major objective was to tackle the problem of 2 ̆ 2 spatial scale 2 ̆ 2. Neighborhoods, by their very nature of contiguity and homogeneity, represent an ideal scale for urban spatial analysis and mapping. Unfortunately, in most areas, neighborhoods are not objectively defined and slum mapping often relies in the use of arbitrary spatial units which do not capture the true extent of the phenomenon. The objective was thus to explore the use of analytic regionalization to quantitatively derive the neighborhood unit for mapping slums. Analytic neighborhoods were created by spatially constrained clustering of statistical areas using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. Unlike previous studies that relied on socio-economic and/or demographic information, this study innovatively used multiple land cover and terrain attributes as neighborhood homogenizing factors. Five analytic neighborhoods (labeled Regions 1 - 5) were created this way and compared using Kruskal Wallis tests for differences in household slum attributes. This was to determine largest possible contiguous areas that could be labeled as slum or non-slum neighborhoods. The results revealed that at least two analytic regions were significantly different in terms of aggregated household indicators. Region 1 stood apart as having significantly higher distributions of overcrowded and non-owner households. It could thus be viewed as the largest potential slum neighborhood in the city. In contrast, regions 3 (located at higher elevation and separated from rest of city by a steep escarpment) was generally associated with low distribution of household slum attributes and could be considered the strongest model of a non-slum or formal neighborhood. Both Regions 1 and 3 were also qualitatively correlated with two locally recognized (vernacular) neighborhoods. These neighborhoods, 2 ̆ 2 Sisia 2 ̆ 2 (for Region 1) and 2 ̆ 2 Up Station 2 ̆ 2 (for Region 3), are commonly perceived by local folk as occupying opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum. The results obtained by successfully carrying the three major objectives have major implication for future research and policy. In the case of multi-index analysis of slum conditions, it affirms the notion the that slum phenomenon is diverse in the local context and that remediation efforts must be compartmentalized to be effective. The results of image based unsupervised mapping of slums from imagery show that it is a tool with high potential for rapid slum assessment even when there is no supporting field data. Finally, the results of analytic regionalization showed that the true extent of contiguous slum neighborhoods can be delineated objectively using land cover and terrain attributes. It thus presents an opportunity for local planning and policy actors to consider redesigning the city neighborhood districts as analytic units. Quantitively derived neighborhoods are likely to be more useful in the long term, be it for spatial sampling, mapping or planning purposes...|$|E
