40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{e-learning}} model {{that is based}} on a dynamic formative evaluation. On evaluating the existing format of e-learning, conditions regarding repetitive learning to achieve mastery, causes issues for learners to lose tension and become neglectful of learning. <b>The</b> dynamic <b>formative</b> evaluation proposed is able to supplement limitation of the existing approaches. Since a repetitive learning method does not provide a perfect feedback, this paper puts an emphasis on <b>the</b> dynamic <b>formative</b> evaluation that is able to maximize learning achievement. Through <b>the</b> dynamic <b>formative</b> evaluation, <b>the</b> instructor is able to refer to the evaluation result when making an estimation about the learner. To show the flow chart of learning, based on <b>the</b> dynamic <b>formative</b> evaluation, <b>the</b> model proves its effectiveness and validity.

50|$|Founded {{some time}} in the centuries before 1000 BCE, Tres Zapotes emerged as a {{regional}} center early in <b>the</b> Middle <b>Formative</b> period, perhaps 900 - 800 BCE, roughly coinciding with the decline of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan. The earliest public architecture yet detected has been dated to the end of <b>the</b> Middle <b>Formative,</b> perhaps 500 BCE.|$|R

5|$|CTW {{conducted}} research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations {{conducted by the}} Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention to the program. Based on these findings, the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. <b>The</b> <b>formative</b> research on Sesame Street {{was the first time}} children's television viewing was studied scientifically.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, Michael Coe and Richard Diehl {{conducted}} excavations on San Lorenzo {{and surrounding}} sites, and defined eight major phases of occupation.The Ojochi (ca. 1750-1550 B.C.) and Bajío (ca. 1550-1450 B.C.) phases constituted <b>the</b> pre-Olmec Initial <b>Formative</b> sequence. In <b>the</b> Early <b>Formative</b> Chicharras phase (ca. 1450-1400 B.C.) more characteristically Olmec artifacts {{appear on the}} site. San Lorenzo rose to the height of its power in the San Lorenzo phase (ca. 1400-1000 B.C.).However, it suffered {{a decline in the}} beginning of <b>the</b> Middle <b>Formative</b> period. This period encompasses the Nacaste (ca. 1000-800 B.C.) and the Palangana (ca. 800-400 B.C.) phases. Its population declined further in <b>the</b> Late <b>Formative</b> Remplás phase (ca. 300-50 B.C.), and while there was occupation during the Early & Middle Classic periods, it was not reoccupied until late in the Villa Alta phase (A.D. 800-1000).|$|R

5|$|Post-punk brought {{together}} a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped {{to develop the}} production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s. Smoothing the edges of their style {{in the direction of}} new wave, several post-punk bands such as New Order (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience. Bauhaus was one of <b>the</b> <b>formative</b> gothic rock bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{road through}} Gateshead Fell was turnpiked by the Durham to Tyne Bridge Road Act in 1747. Although it had brought some early {{settlers}} to the area, {{the development of}} industry allowed <b>the</b> <b>formative</b> settlement to grow. In 1740, John Warburton opened a pottery at Carr Hill which is credited with introducing white earthenware to Tyneside. Encouraged by Warburton's success, Paul Jackson established the Sheriff Hill Pottery in 1771 at {{the northern end of}} the turnpike road and by 1775 was advertising his earthenware in the Newcastle Journal. Jackson's pottery, which became a local centre of pottery production, attracted settlers to the area and became a source of pride to local residents.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>formative</b> {{years of}} women's rights movements, the {{difference}} between the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that {{the difference between}} men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{returned}} for the Third Test at Old Trafford, where {{the home team}} elected to bat first. In an effective containing performance, Johnston took 3/67 from 45.5 overs in the first innings. England had looked assured in the first hour, before Johnstonagain taking the new ball with Lindwallbowled Cyril Washbrook with a yorker to leave England at 1/22. Johnston had been bowling from over the wicket, and his left-arm deliveries had generally been swinging back into the right-handed Washbrook. However, the opening batsman did not detect Johnston’s variation ball, which was released from wide of the crease and angled across more sharply without curling back in. Washbrook played inside {{the line of the}} ball, which hit his stumps. Australia nearly had two wickets in the same over as the new batsman Edrich struggled. He played loosely outside the off stump to the first ball from Johnston but did not get an edge, and on the third delivery, Edrich survived again. Receiving a ball on middle and leg stump, he tried to defend it straight back down the pitch, rather than the conventional stroke to the leg side, and managed to edge the ball past the slips for four. Johnston repeatedly hurried Edrich with his pace, forcing the batsman to make many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot during <b>the</b> <b>formative</b> stage of his innings.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl {{formed on}} August 28, after a quiet July {{in the open}} Atlantic Ocean. Beryl grazed Cape Verde, killing 3people. Tropical Depression Three formed just behind Beryl, {{tracking}} east and north of the Caribbean sea in early September. Soon after the dissipation of Beryl, Tropical Storm Chris formed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 9. Chris stayed as a weak storm, making landfall near Sabine Pass, Texas, and dissipated over land on September 13. Hurricane Debby was the next storm and the strongest of the season. <b>The</b> <b>formative</b> stage of Debby produced rainfall in Puerto Rico and soon strengthened into a Category4 Major Hurricane. Debby passed by Newfoundland on September 18 and merged with a non-tropical low on September 20. In mid-September, Tropical Depression Six formed west of Africa, and tracked west-northwest, dissipating before reaching the Leeward Islands on September 20. Its remnant thunderstorm activity continued moving west-northwest, forming Tropical Depression Seven which moved near Bermuda on September 25 before dissipating offshore Nova Scotia. The final storm of the season, Tropical Storm Ernesto, was the shortest lasting storm {{of the season and}} stayed out to sea, dissipating on October 2.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and an upper-level ridge over the southwestern United States, the newly upgraded Erick tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico. A central dense overcast formed by the daylight hours of July5, with tight banding noted on satellite. In addition, microwave imagery indicated <b>the</b> <b>formative</b> stages of an eyewall. Initially vertically decoupled, the storm became more vertically aligned throughout the following hours. A ragged eye became intermittently visible on satellite, and Erick was upgraded to Category1 hurricane status at 0600UTC, located approximately 105mi (170km) west-southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, it is estimated that Erick attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983mb (hPa; 29.03inHg) at 1200UTC. Shortly thereafter, its proximity to the coastline of Mexico and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to begin a weakening trend. At 1800UTC on July7, Erick weakened to a tropical storm as its associated convective mass warmed and the eye deteriorated. Wind shear caused the center of circulation to become exposed on July9 as the system passed just south of Baja California Sur, leading to degeneration into a remnant low-pressure area at 0600UTC. The remnant vortex persisted for a few more hours, before dissipating over cold sea surface temperatures at 0000 UTC on July 10.|$|E
