5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>is,</b> {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>is</b> abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>is</b> scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
5|$|Mimicry systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} bipolar. Only one bipolar arrangement is possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating its target, in the first case, termed Batesian-Wallacian mimicry after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>is</b> the prey species. In the second case, <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>is</b> {{the host of a}} brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>is</b> usually another species, {{except in}} automimicry, where {{members of the}} species mimic other members, or other parts of their own bodies, and in inter-sexual mimicry, where members of one sex mimic members of the other.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{cutaway model}} of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>is</b> at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres.
