500|$|In 1956 Holloway {{created the}} role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the {{original}} [...] Broadway production of My Fair Lady. The librettist, Alan Jay Lerner, remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridge's: Lerner recalled, [...] "He put down his knife and fork, {{threw back his head}} and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted." [...] Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, the 1958 London version at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the film version in 1964, which he undertook instead of {{the role of}} Admiral Bloom in Mary Poppins that he had been offered the same year. [...] In The Manchester Guardian, Alistair Cooke wrote, [...] "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England." [...] Also in 1964, he appeared as Bellomy in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of The Fantasticks.|$|E

2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, two Palestinian terrorists of the Islamic Jihad, {{disguised}} as Israeli soldiers and equipped with battle vests, M16 rifles and hand grenades, {{made their way}} to <b>the</b> settlement <b>through</b> <b>the</b> valley located between Othniel and the town of Dahariya, and managed to infiltrate into the settlement. The terrorists cut the rickety fence which was erected around the building of the Yeshiva and afterwards, around 19:45 pm, they snuck into <b>the</b> building <b>through</b> <b>the</b> back door of the kitchen. The students on kitchen duty had just finished preparing the main dishes on serving plates and were about to bring them into <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> when <b>the</b> terrorists entered the kitchen and opened fire at them. In the last moments of his life, Staff Sergeant Noam Apter, upon immediately realizing what was happening, managed to lock the sliding door separating the kitchen and <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> before he was killed by the terrorists. In doing so, Noam prevented the terrorists from entering <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and carrying out a far deadlier attack. Nevertheless, after killing the students on kitchen duty, the terrorists smashed the window of the sliding door and began shooting <b>through</b> it into <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> wounding four yeshiva students, one of them critically. The majority of the students in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> managed to hide underneath the tables while some of them, who were carrying weapons with them, returned fire at the terrorists.|$|R
50|$|The {{flat roof}} of <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is {{extended}} {{to form a}} covered terrace, which connects with the irregular roof of the small timber sauna. The terrace is served by a fire which backs up against the fireplace in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> and over which a rustic stone staircase rises to the wooden deck on the roof. The angle of the stairs determines {{the line of the}} plaster which rises diagonally across the fire to level out over the door. The same angle is continued outside in the flue which connects at the first-floor level into the service wing - a typical example of a rigorous formal integration which underlies Aalto’s at times seemingly willful manipulation of form. The rectangular pier {{at the end of the}} terrace affords another example. Viewed in isolation this seems to be simply another instance of Aalto’s desire to break the ‘artificial rhythms’ established by a regular grid, akin to the doubling and tripling of columns in the living room, but it is also an act as a visual and formal termination to the implied band of secondary circulation which runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door between <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and terrace, past the servery wall which defines the entrance hall.|$|R
50|$|Chapman {{had been}} dining with his lover and future fiancée Betty Farmer at the Hotel de la Plage {{immediately}} before his arrest and, {{when he saw}} undercover police coming to arrest him for crimes on the mainland, made a spectacular exit <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> window (which was shut at the time). Later that same night he committed the slapdash burglary {{for which he had}} to immediately begin serving two years in a Jersey prison, which, ironically, spared him at least 14 more years' imprisonment in a mainland prison afterwards.|$|E

He then visits a social club, where members of the Car-D gang eject two members of rival gang The Krew. Returning, they hurl a bicycle through the function room window, urging the Car-D to give chase {{up to the edge}} of their territory where they escape via a walkway. John gives chase, running into an ambush and is in turn chased by The Krew and pursued by their leader. Escaping by pushing his way into an Irish woman's home, John evades the rival gang. It emerges later that she is the mother of the boy who hurled the bicycle.|$|E

40|$|Book synopsis: Queering the Interior problematizes the {{familiar}} space of 'home', exploring how queer {{men and women}} experience domestic life and unveiling the detail and complexity of queer home making. The book follows an innovative, unusual structure: divided into two sections, Upstairs and Downstairs, each of the nine chapters examine a different room or space inside the home. Our journey starts in the entryway and continues <b>through</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room,</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> kitchen, garden, bathroom/toilets, bedroom, closets, to the nursery. Each room is examined <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lens of specialists {{from a wide range}} of disciplines. Drawing upon a variety of methods – including case studies, spatial analysis, interviews and a photo essay – contributors from the UK, Australia, Canada, and the United States present detailed, grounded work which is rare to find in heavily theorised fields such as gender studies and queer theory. A highly creative approach to queer analysis of domestic spaces, Queering the Interior makes an important contribution to fields such as gender studies, cultural studies, design, architecture, anthropology, sociology, and cultural geography...|$|R
25|$|The {{art gallery}} was another extravagance of Strousberg's for {{the display of}} his {{painting}} and sculpture collection. East of the gallery, the Billiards room provided a convenient entertaining room, which led back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> walnut paneled <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> to either <b>the</b> drawing room or into the library. Above the library's panelling, which was again carved from walnut, were murals and a skylight set into the ceiling. At night this room, like the others, was lit by gas light. The rest of the Palais's ground floor accommodation served as anterooms and work rooms for the Ambassador. Above the small windows of the Servants' quarters in the basement; {{the windows of the}} great hall, its anteroom and the portrait gallery, stood more than 3 metres tall, overlooking and visually connected the rooms with each other and the gardens in the large courtyard. The facades that faced onto this courtyard were given a unifying treatment with Corinthian columns dividing the glazing. Originally it was open to the west, where a curved terrace opened onto a garden. Its location can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. Its plan shape can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. The terrace was adjacent to the garden of the Palais Redern and effectively extended the small garden of the Palais Strousberg into the generous garden of the Palais Redern.|$|R

5000|$|Having himself {{spent time}} as a youth the Santa Cruz Mountains {{not far from the}} Brookdale Lodge, he chose to redecorate the {{facility}} in 1939 to pattern it after the lodge. [...] Working with rock sculptor Francois Scotti, Clifford created a 20-foot waterfall [...] "cascading into a quiet stream" [...] which then [...] "meandered" [...] <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> past faux redwood trees used to conceal the room's steel columns. [...] Renowned Los Angeles muralist, Einar C. Petersen, created a life size forest on canvas to cover one wall, and a small chapel was set among the crags to fulfill Clifford's desire to feed the soul as well as the body of depression-weary Angelinos. [...] After refurbishment, he renamed the location [...] "Clifton's Brookdale". [...] The interior includes a stuffed moose head, animated raccoons, and a fishing bear.|$|E
5000|$|Inside {{the mansion}} {{are a number}} of richly {{decorated}} state rooms; of the interior features, only the hall, the staircase tower and the chapel are Gothic in design. The high staircase hall features a stone stair with iron railing, surrounded by niches containing statues by Sir Richard Westmacott. At the centre of the fan-vaulted ceiling is a large dial connected to the weather vane on the roof which displays the current wind direction. The Brownlow Hall contains a giant frieze of the goddess Venus surrounded by putti with an armorial centrepiece and three early-Twentieth Century murals. Redecoration of the interiors was commissioned by Lady Marian Alford and executed in the neoclassical style in 1855-63 by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, including a replica of Guido Reni's [...] ceiling and aedicular door surrounds. Among the alterations carried out after the conversion of the mansion into a college, the conservatory was altered by Clough Williams-Ellis in 1919 to form a dining-room. The boundary between Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire originally passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> though the house is now entirely in Hertfordshire.|$|E
5000|$|Cooper then chased Kalan {{into the}} house and {{continued}} shooting all the way. Once Cooper opened fire, the hired girl, Josephine Grubetich, abandoned her dishwashing and ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> into the master bedroom. She saw both rooms filled to the brim with smoke, heard the shouting, and paused between the two rooms. Cooper emptied his gun, firing into the kitchen {{in the back of the}} house into the front rooms of the house. According to Rebels on the Range: The Michigan Copper Miners' Strike of 1913-1914 (1984) by Arthur W. Thurner,"Albert Tijan, at the first rough handling of Kalan in the yard, jumped through a window; he ran upstairs to the boarders' bedrooms, then down again, in time to witness the men, guns drawn, at the windows and Josephine and the children running into the dining room. He returned upstairs. As he ran, he heard one shot, then the fusillade. Moments later, his 18-year-old brother Alois came up and collapsed in his arms, saying, 'Brother, they killed me.' He had been shot as he reached the foot of the stairs. Albert placed Alois who indicated he had been hit on his left side on one of the beds. He pulled up his brother's shirt and talked to him but got no response. Antonia Putrich, after turning about excitedly on the road outside, oblivious to neighbor Lisa Mutka's beckoning her to take shelter across the road, waited until she saw the deputies walk away. Steve Putrich remained in the yard until Cooper came out of the shed. One of the Italian neighbors saw him grow pale and limber, then walk {{into the house}}. When Mrs. Putrich reentered, she found him mortally wounded, standing in the kitchen. 'I am shot', he told her, 'and if anything happens to me, send my money to my children.' He was taken upstairs." ...|$|E
50|$|Toward the {{beginning}} of the 18th Century, a pattern emerged where the ladies of the house would withdraw after dinner from <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> to <b>the</b> drawing room.
