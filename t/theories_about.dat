5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new <b>theories</b> <b>about</b> electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
5|$|In 1627, Kepler {{published}} his Rudolphine Tables.

The Mercury transit occurred as predicted and was observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck, Johannes Remus Quietanus in Rouffach and Pierre Gassendi in Paris, vindicating the Keplerian approach. But their observations threw into question previous <b>theories</b> <b>about</b> the Solar System as Mercury was shown to be much smaller than expected.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine, with {{background}} of the swedish specialized social service, how the client is formed in a process by categorizing and sorting in the receiving department of the financial support. Which factors professionals are perceived to be problematic in the management of cases and the social workers approach to meet the clients needs. The study was conducted with one qualitative semi-structured interview with the head of the department of financial support, and two focus group interviews with social workers at the department of financial support. The theoretical approach is Hasenfeld´s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> human service organizations, Billquist´s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the sorting process and Johansson´s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the client construction process. The empirical results also relate to Johansson´s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> mass handling of clients and Svensson, Johnsson and Laanemets <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the social workers action space. The conclusion of this study is that a specialized social service is categorizing and sorting the client through all parts of the process in the receiving department of financial support. The result shows that several factors makes it problematic for the social workers to respond to the client needs in a specialized social service, causing the social workers to use their acion space...|$|R

In the Prose Edda, she is additionally described as the wife of Glenr. As a proper noun, Sól appears throughout Old Norse literature.

5|$|Many Egyptologists and {{anthropologists have}} {{suggested}} <b>theories</b> <b>about</b> how the gods developed {{in these early}} times. Gustave Jéquier, for instance, thought the Egyptians first revered primitive fetishes, then deities in animal form, and finally deities in human form, whereas Henri Frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning. Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic, and more current ones, such as Siegfried Morenz' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment, are difficult to prove.|$|E

5|$|The arcs in the Adams ring remain unexplained. Their {{existence}} is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply {{that they should}} spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several <b>theories</b> <b>about</b> the arcs' confinement have been suggested, the most widely publicized of which holds that Galatea confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring's orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings' mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led {{to the conclusion that}} the rings are not in CIR with Galatea.|$|E
5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} <b>theories</b> <b>about</b> a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery.

He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} <b>theories</b> <b>about</b> it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{outsourcing}} and outsourcing’s impact on Denmark - the Danish economy and occupation. We {{want to study}} the consequences outsourcing comes with. The paper is written with an economic and sociological approach. The economic part of {{the paper is the}} part where we describe the economical segments as outsourcing, competitiveness, productivity etc. In the sociological part of the paper we take on the sociological glasses and see how the globalization has influent the outsourcing and its process. Furthermore we will take a look on the workers who looses their jobs due to outsourcing and what the help organizations do to help them out of their problems. Throughout the paper we have used a couple of theories like Anthony Gidden’s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> modernity, Adam Smith’s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> absolute advantages, David Riccardo’s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> comparative advantages, Porters <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the value chain, and last Willamson’s <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> transaction cost to help us get {{a better understanding of the}} phenomenon known as outsourcing. After working on this project we can conclude that there are more positive effects of outsourcing than negative – like higher educated occupation, less companies goes bankrupt, more growth is generated etc. Furthermore we can conclude that outsourcing does not have a big impact or influence on the Danish economy, due to the “few” companies who outsources – more people is employed than unemployed...|$|R
