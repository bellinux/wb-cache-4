5|$|A {{research}} team undertook {{a study in}} 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably faster vibrato and use of subharmonics as unique characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers, and confirmed a vocal range from F#2 to G5 (just over 3 octaves) but were unable to confirm claims of a 4-octave range. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, {{and a series of}} interviews of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic video camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.|$|E

40|$|Publicado en: Research Evaluation Vol. 10, Num. 1 (Apr. 2001), pp. 47 - 58 Interdisciplinarity is {{analyzed}} {{in three different}} research areas: Pharmacology & Pharmacy, Cardiovascular System and Materials Science, by means of data collected from a survey to Spanish scientists. The study focuses on three different and complementary dimensions. First, diversity in personal training and research specialization of scientists is analyzed both {{in the field and}} within <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams.</b> Secondly, <b>research</b> practices and behavior of the groups are considered, taking into account the use of cross-disciplinary knowledge or techniques and the collaboration with scientists from other disciplines. The third dimension refers to the cognitive inputs and outputs of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> activity and focuses on the diversity of subjects of the journals used for publication and for reference by <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams.</b> Interdisciplinarity emerges in research areas as a double edge process: either as a process of jumping into a new area with people of different disciplines, in coherence with <b>the</b> traditional disciplinary <b>research</b> <b>teams,</b> or as a process of specialization in field traditionally dominated by a single group of disciplinary backgrounds, in which researchers from different areas join <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams.</b> Thus specialization-fragmentation-hybridization come all-together.

5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increased}} running time, budget and facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as longer and more intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, who handled the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many {{effective}} innovations {{and interventions}} are never effectively scaled up. Implementation <b>research</b> (IR) has <b>the</b> promise of supporting scale-up through enabling rapid {{learning about the}} intervention and its fit with {{the context in which}} it is implemented. We integrate conceptual frameworks addressing different dimensions of scaling up (specifically, the attributes of the service or innovation being scaled, the actors involved, the context, and the scale-up strategy) and questions commonly addressed by IR (concerning acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility, fidelity to original design, implementation costs, coverage and sustainability) to explore how IR can support scale-up. Methods: We draw upon three IR studies conducted by Future Health Systems (FHS) in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Uganda. We reviewed project documents from the period 2011 - 2016 to identify information related, to the dimensions of scaling up. Further, for each country, we developed rich descriptions of how <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> approached scaling up, and how IR contributed to scale-up. The rich descriptions were checked by FHS <b>research</b> <b>teams.</b> We identified common patterns and. differences across the three cases. Results: The three cases planned quite different innovations/interventions and had very different types of scale-up strategies. In all three cases, <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> had extensive prior experience within the study communities, and. little explicit attention was paid, to contextual factors. All three cases involved complex interactions between <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> and other stakeholders, among stakeholders, and between stakeholders and the intervention. The IR planned by <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> focussed primarily on feasibility and effectiveness, but in practice, <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> also had critical insights into other factors such as sustainability, acceptability, cost-effectiveness and appropriateness. Stakeholder analyses and other project management tools further complemented IR. Conclusions: IR can provide significant insights into how best to scale-up a particular intervention. To take advantage of insights from IR, scale-up strategies require flexibility and IR must also be sufficiently flexible to respond to new emerging questions. While commonly used conceptual frameworks for scale-up clearly delineate actors, such as implementers, target communities and the support team, in our experience, IR blurred the links between these groups.
