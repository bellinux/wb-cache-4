The {{minister}} Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and not to bother his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring {{that the people of}} Galuh are unaware that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> king.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44 tries, 12 {{more than in}} 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only did <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> head coach, but also 13 new players in their squad, and a new captain after Anton Oliver took over the reins from Tane Randell. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth, after winning four, and losing six of their eleven matches.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The plot was likened by Walton of The Moving Picture News to Enoch Arden, but the story differs in several ways. Published by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1864, the poem tells of the eponymous character who becomes shipwrecked on a desert island and returns home a decade later to find his wife has remarried and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> child. For {{the sake of his}} wife's happiness, he never lets her know that he is alive. The plot differs because the husband willingly fakes his death and returns {{on the day of the}} wedding. Rather than announce himself, he attempts to leave and dies in the process, his body is removed by the prospective husband before marrying her. The similarity with the poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt the wedding by revealing the fact that he is alive is ensured by John's true death at the climax. The New York Dramatic Mirror noted that the journalists arrived to photograph and cover the apparent suicide too quickly, making it illogical that the fake suicide would not have been revealed.|$|E

UNIT are represented by a nuclear missile convoy wearing UN issued blue berets and DPM camouflage. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> UNIT insignia patch of a winged globe, which is worn the upper sleeves and beret. There is also a Czech engineer team wearing Czech camouflage with the same UN issued blue beret as the convoy. The Brigadier returns, wearing at different times service dress, barrack dress, and DPM while wearing a cap rather than beret.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first step}} to {{diagnosing}} a headache is {{to determine if the}} headache is old or new. A [...] "new headache" [...] can be a headache that has started recently, or a chronic headache that has changed character.

2500|$|Britten and Bird {{go to see}} Sam at his home; {{he claims}} {{that he was trying}} to find out about his father, who had cancer. Britten asks how tall he was; outside, Bird asks for an {{explanation}} and Britten tries to spin a story about a small window at the clinic that someone could have crawled through to poison MacKenzie. His partner warns Britten that coming up with theories and looking for evidence to fit is not standard procedure. That night, Rex and Cole work on their motorbike. Later, in the [...] "red reality", Hannah tells Britten that she opened the package and was glad she did. She tells her husband about the motorcycle, and how the boys would claim they were going to the beach when they went off to work on it. At the station, Vega tells Britten that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> case; however, he insists on sticking with the MacKenzie shooting and checks photos of short criminals. The homeless man comes in and offers more information in return for lunch. The partners start arguing, and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) calls Britten into her office. Soon after, Britten asks Vega if he wants to lead a new case.|$|E

60|$|Fifthly, There {{is usually}} some similitude betwixt {{the father and}} the child; it may be the child looks like its father; so those that are born again, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> similitude, they have the image of Jesus Christ (Gal. iv.), every one that is born of God has {{something}} of the features of heaven upon him. Men love those children that are likest them most usually; so does God his children; therefore they are called the children of God. But others do not look like him, therefore they are called Sodomites. Christ describes children of the devil by their features; the children of the devil, his works they will do; all works of unrighteousness, they are the devil's works. If you are earthly, you have borne the image of the earthly; if heavenly, you have borne the image of the heavenly.|$|E
60|$|In the West and South <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> institution--the Broom Brigade. It is {{composed}} of young ladies who dress in a uniform costume, {{and go through the}} infantry drill, with broom in place of musket. It is a very pretty sight, on private view. When they perform on the stage of a theater, in the blaze of colored fires, it must be a fine and fascinating spectacle. I saw them go through their complex manual with grace, spirit, and admirable precision. I saw them do everything which a human being can possibly do with a broom, except sweep. I did not see them sweep. But I know they could learn. What they have already learned proves that. And if they ever should learn, and should go on the war-path down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other streets around there, those thoroughfares would bear a greatly improved aspect in a very few minutes. But the girls themselves wouldn't; so nothing would be really gained, after all.|$|E

60|$|It is besides to be considered, {{whether an}} Assembly like yours, even supposing {{that it was}} in {{possession}} of another sort of organ, through which its orders were to pass, is fit for promoting the obedience and discipline of an army. It is known that armies have hitherto yielded a very precarious and uncertain obedience to any senate or popular authority; and they will least of all yield it to an Assembly which is to have only a continuance of two years. The officers must totally lose the characteristic disposition of military men, if they see with perfect submission and due admiration the dominion of pleaders,--especially when they find that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> court to pay to an endless succession of those pleaders, whose military policy, and the genius of whose command, (if they should have any,) must be as uncertain as their duration is transient. In the weakness of one kind of authority, and in the fluctuation of all, the officers of an army will remain for some time mutinous and full of faction, until some popular general, who understands the art of conciliating the soldiery, and who possesses the true spirit of command, shall draw the eyes of all men upon himself. Armies will obey him on his personal account. There is no other way of securing military obedience in this state of things. But the moment in which that event shall happen, the person who really commands the army is your master,--the master (that is little) of your king, the master of your Assembly, the master of your whole republic.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first was}} that Northumberland Street encounter, {{which all the}} papers have narrated. Have any novelists of our days a scene and {{catastrophe}} more strange and terrible than this which occurs at noonday within a few yards of the greatest thoroughfare in Europe? At the theatres <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> name for their melodramatic pieces, and call them [...] "Sensation Dramas." [...] What a sensation Drama this is! What have people been flocking to see at the Adelphi Theatre for the last hundred and fifty nights? A woman pitched overboard out of a boat, and a certain Miles taking a tremendous [...] "header," [...] and bringing her to shore? Bagatelle! What is this compared to the real life-drama, of which a midday representation takes place just opposite the Adelphi in Northumberland Street? The brave Dumas, the intrepid Ainsworth, the terrible Eugene Sue, the cold-shudder-inspiring [...] "Woman in White," [...] the astounding author of the [...] "Mysteries of the Court of London," [...] never invented anything more tremendous than this. It might have happened to you and me. We want to borrow a little money. We are directed to an agent. We propose a pecuniary transaction at a short date. He goes into the next room, as we fancy, to get the bank-notes, and returns with [...] "two very pretty, delicate little ivory-handled pistols," [...] and blows a portion of our heads off. After this, what {{is the use of}} being squeamish about the probabilities and possibilities in the writing of fiction? Years ago I remember making merry over a play of Dumas, called Kean, in which the [...] "Coal-Hole Tavern" [...] was represented on the Thames, with a fleet of pirate-ships moored alongside. Pirate-ships? Why not? What a cavern of terror was this in Northumberland Street, with its splendid furniture covered with dust, its empty bottles, in the midst of which sits a grim [...] "agent," [...] amusing himself by firing pistols, aiming at the unconscious mantel-piece, or at the heads of his customers! ...|$|E
