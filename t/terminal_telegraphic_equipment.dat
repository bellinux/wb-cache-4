50|$|The new firm, {{located at}} 93 St. Clair Street in Cleveland, grew. In May 1869, Elisha Gray, an Oberlin College {{professor}} and inventor of <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment,</b> bought out Shawk's interest.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Co. Ltd. {{entered into}} a {{contract}} with the Commissioners of Irish Lights to put <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment</b> and aerials on the Fastnet Rock. The telegraphic station was moved up to Brow Head where the signal tower equipment had been used for so long to contact passing ships. Messages were sent to the Fastnet Rock Lighthouse by signalling methods and then relayed to the Brow Head station by wireless telegraphy for relaying on to the recipients.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{federation}} of Australia in 1901, the Postmaster-General's Department {{was established to}} take over from the states all postal and telegraphic services and administer them on a national basis. The PMG Department progressively improved <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment.</b> In 1905, the use of Wheatstone equipment on the Adelaide and Perth routes improved speed to 220 words per minute. By 1922, the Murray Multiplex System allowed one line {{to be used for}} eight transmissions at the speed of 50 words per transmission per minute.|$|R
50|$|Aloyseum: The museum houses {{several items}} with {{historic}} significance {{including the first}} car of Mangalore and Mangalore’s first electric generator dating back to 1930, the Old Missal {{with the size of}} a broadsheet newspaper, animal and fish bones, skulls, horns and skins,mineral specimen, old radios, <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment,</b> antique telephone sets, manuscripts on palm leaves, Portuguese statues, an old pulpit from Cordel Church, copies of paintings by old European masters, swords, daggers and other weapons, postal stamps, coins and medals, priestly vestments dating back to 1878.|$|R
50|$|The {{station at}} Musandam was fitted with <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment</b> by Siemens. There were {{quarters}} for the telegraph operators, together with {{those for the}} servants and two hulks fitted up for staff who wanted {{a break from the}} monotony of living on the island. They had a couple of boats for their leisure time, and regular newspaper deliveries. This, together with the work of maintaining the cable, and visits from steamers to change over staff and bring supplies, it was hoped would keep the staff occupied.|$|R
50|$|The Philatelic Museum {{is located}} {{on the second floor of}} the Correos {{building}} and was established in 1985. It contains a noted collection of Costa Rican stamps and postal history items in two rooms with the first room containing old <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment</b> and an office scenario. The museum has some rare stamps including the 1863 first Costa Rican stamps, and many stamps from Costa Rica and worldwide. The museum also organizes a stamp exchange fair once a month on a Saturday in which collectors gather to examine each other's collections and make possible exchanges.|$|R
50|$|In October 1870, Murray {{was hired}} by Thomas Alva Edison and George Harrington to work at American Telegraph Works, which {{manufactured}} <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment.</b> Together with Edison, he founded in February 1872, the small company J.T. Murray and Company, also producing telegraph equipment. In {{the third quarter of}} 1873, they reorganized as Edison and Murray and also assumed the operations of the recently defunct Edison and Unger company. Edison, Murray and the inventor Jarvis B. Edson incorporated the Domestic Telegraph Company in 1874. Although Edison and Murray formally dissolved in their partnership in July 1875, Edison continued to use and improve products manufactured by Murray.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1798 the Admiralty created the Sea Fencibles, a force of coastal militia, {{following}} a plan by Popham. On 8 May 1798 Home Popham led an expedition to Ostend to destroy the sluice gates of the Bruge canal. The expedition landed a contingent of 1,300 British Army soldiers {{under the command of}} Major General Coote. The troops burnt some ships in the harbour before blowing up locks and gates on the canal. His force then surrounded had to surrender as adverse winds prevented their re-embarkation. It was during this period perhaps in captivity, before being returned home that Popham began work on a standard signal instructions handbook for the Royal Navy. Ship to ship communication was very haphazard: a fleet system that protected vulnerable frigates on station was essential to save time and material. The global character of the navy required linking to larger fleet formations. During service on HMS Romney in the Battle of Copenhagen Popham tested his <b>telegraphic</b> <b>equipment.</b> He acted as liaison officer to the Danish Court off station from Elsinore. Popham was under the direction of Admiral Archibald Dickson when he devised the two or three flag hoist, in which each sign was a number, and each combination a different state of readiness. The vocabulary was limited and totally nautical, apposite to a direct command. At Copenhagen boats could be sent ashore, but were unnecessary using only flag signals. Popham was deeply encouraged by Lord Spencer, 1st Lord of the Admiralty who advised publication of the signal books. The new Signals were immensely useful to Nelson at Trafalgar in developing navy tactics in secret. Popham proved McArthur, his critic and rival, wrong; Popham's books were printed several times after the battle.|$|R
50|$|The last RAF connection, an {{automatic}} routing installation, which opened on 25 May 1983 and {{was run by}} 840 Signals Unit was closed in March 1996. It occupied the old Northern Radar building ground floor, refurbished to accommodate the <b>Telegraphic</b> Automatic Routing <b>Equipment</b> (TARE) and a manual telegraphic switching centre and was parented by RAF Finningley. The TARE was a dual suite Ferranti Argus 500 computer system, each suite having a 64 k word core store and two 2 Mbyte hard drives and running software written using Coral 66.|$|R
50|$|The line {{opened for}} general traffic in December 1867. It owned seven coaches, sixteen wagons and one goods van but, initially, no locomotive. Motive power line was {{provided}} by the contractors who had become shareholders in the company. Instead of booking office staff, tickets were sold on the train, and there was {{little in the way of}} <b>telegraphic</b> or signalling <b>equipment.</b> The first locomotive was a 2-4-0 tank engine supplied in 1868 by Beyer, Peacock and Company and was named Shrewsbury and Talbot after a local landowner. By 1874, Stafford had expanded northwards and a new station was built at the Common, where there was horseracing, fares and agricultural shows.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s RAF Stanbridge had {{satellite}} sites at RAF Bampton Castle (Receiver site), RAF Weyhill (Transmitter site), RAF Edlesborough (Transmitter site), RAF Greatworth (transmitter site) and RAF Stoke Hammond (Receiver site). Stanbridge was {{then known as}} the Communications Control Centre (CCC or Commcen Central) and was {{the hub of the}} Defence Communications Network (DCN). The main building hosted Systems Control, a tape relay centre and later a <b>Telegraphic</b> Automatic Routing <b>Equipment</b> (TARE). The DCN connected sites all over the world by HF radio links using the two diverse transmitter sites and the diverse receiver sites. The Distant Terminals of these links included Canberra, Gan, Cyprus, Ottawa and Malta. Other UK sites involved were the RN site at HMS Forest Moor and RAF Oakhanger with its satellite earth-station.|$|R
