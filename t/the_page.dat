40|$|Abstract. An {{adaptive}} Web system adapts <b>the</b> Web <b>pages</b> to its users, {{based on}} {{the current state of}} the system. There are two approaches to this <b>page</b> adaptation: either <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> exist statically or they are generated dynamically. In the first approach, the system may add, remove, or change the fragments inside <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> to adapt it. In this case, since <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> are predesigned, there are limitations to the changes that can be applied. On the contrary, when <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> are generated dynamically (the second approach), all the features and attributes of <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> may be customized {{based on the}} current state of the system. In this paper, we formalize dynamic generation of Web pages and refer to it as Web page synthesis. An architecture for an adaptation server, which uses a synthesis engine to generate Web pages, is proposed. ...|$|R

In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer, are stored and managed separately from <b>the</b> web <b>pages,</b> so <b>the</b> scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping <b>the</b> <b>pages.</b>|$|R
