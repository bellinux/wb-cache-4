5|$|It was {{restored}} to working order in 1979, winning a conservation award in 1982. The mill is still used <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> wheat flour. A cafe was {{opened in the}} buildings {{which used to be}} the wagon house and stables. Further restoration work, completed in 2007, was funded by the Exmoor Sustainable Development Fund.|$|E
5|$|The mill {{stands on}} a site where a mill was first {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book, but the present building was constructed around 1780. It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> flour. The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels. It {{is owned by the}} National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company.|$|E

5|$|The sails of Skidby Windmill {{can be seen}} {{providing}} the power <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> flour on certain days, and natural sites provide interest at Spurn, Bempton Cliffs, Hornsea Mere, Humber Estuary, River Hull, Watton Beck, River Derwent, River Ouse, River Aire, River Trent, and River Don, {{some of which are}} owned or run by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.|$|E
5|$|Thelnetham Windmill, {{also known}} as Button's Mill is a Grade II* listed tower mill {{constructed}} of brick. The windmill is located at Thelnetham, Suffolk, England. It {{was built in the}} early nineteenth century <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> wheat into flour. Thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924, latterly on two sails, after which it became derelict.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{was not in}} Bradman's planned Test team. However, the Australian skipper {{changed his}} mind {{on the morning of}} the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket. Johnston had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on similar surfaces. He showed his credentials by taking a match total of 9/183 from 84 overs to help Australia <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> out a victory by eight wickets. England elected to bat first and after strike bowler Ray Lindwall broke down on the first day, the burden on Johnston grew.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{returned}} the post-touchdown kickoff to its 34-yard line, where the Hokies began their first offensive drive {{of the fourth}} quarter. Randall ran for nine yards, Suggs for three, then Randall completed two passes for 16 yards to push the Hokies into Air Force territory. Once there, Tech continued <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> forward as Suggs ran the ball on five consecutive plays for 15 yards and a first down. After Randall was sacked for a loss of eight yards, however, Tech sent in Warley, who kicked a 37-yard line to restore Tech's seven-point lead, 20–13, with 4:03 {{to go in the}} game.|$|E
5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used <b>to</b> <b>grind,</b> but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E

5|$|Having {{crossed into}} Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots {{had been set}} up along the path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in {{preparation}} for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> the grains into flour. The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{buildings}} {{include the}} Nunnery, Dunster Watermill, Dovecote and the Priory barn, which belonged to Dunster Priory. Dunster Working Watermill (also known as Castle Mill) is a restored 18th century watermill, {{situated on the}} River Avill, close to Gallox Bridge, in the grounds of Dunster Castle. It is a Grade II* listed building. The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book, but the present building was constructed around 1780. It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> flour. The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels. It {{is owned by the}} National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company.|$|E
50|$|The portal (ataria in Basque) had {{a central}} role in the {{everyday}} life of the baserritarras, being home to activities ranging from a wide variety of social activities <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> flour and animal slaughtering.|$|R
50|$|Since {{honing stones}} look similar <b>to</b> <b>{{grinding}}</b> wheels, {{it is tempting}} to think of honing as a form of low-stock removal grinding. Instead, it is better {{to think of it as}} a self-truing grinding process.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Körber Schleifring and United Grinding Technologies were {{combined}} {{under the new}} brand name UNITED GRINDING Group - Körber Solutions. This move expanded the company’s global market position in relation <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> technology, service and volume.|$|R
5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 years ago <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, {{and the nature of}} the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|Samson was {{betrayed by}} his lover Delilah, who ordered a servant {{to cut his}} hair while he was {{sleeping}} and turned him over to his Philistine enemies, who gouged out his eyes and forced him <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> grain in a mill at Gaza. When the Philistines took Samson into their temple of Dagon, Samson asked to rest {{against one of the}} support pillars; after being granted permission, he prayed to God and miraculously recovered his strength, allowing him to grasp hold of the columns and tear them down, killing himself and all the Philistines with him. In some Jewish traditions, Samson {{is believed to have been}} buried in Tel Tzora in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley.|$|E
50|$|A {{herbivore}} is {{an animal}} anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage, {{for the main}} component of its diet. As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted <b>to</b> rasping or <b>grinding.</b> Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> grass, tree bark, and other tough plant material.|$|R
25|$|Nana Sahib {{placed the}} care of these {{survivors}} under a sex worker called Hussaini Khanum (also known as Hussaini Begum). She put the captives <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> corn for chapatis. Poor sanitary conditions at Bibighar led to deaths from cholera and dysentery.|$|R
50|$|This ski {{was first}} ever {{constructed}} like a skateboard. Since {{the act of}} skiing has changed from simply skiing down a hill <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> metal railing (urban skiing) the market demanded a ski to hold up stronger than the current construction.|$|R
5|$|The English {{economy was}} {{fundamentally}} agricultural, depending on growing {{crops such as}} wheat, barley and oats on an open field system, and husbanding sheep, cattle and pigs. In the late Anglo-Saxon period many peasants moved away from living in isolated hamlets and instead came together to form larger villages engaged in arable cultivation. Agricultural land became typically organised around manors, and was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage directly, called demesne land, {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants. These peasants would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce. By the 11th century, a market economy was flourishing across much of England, while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade. Around 6,000 watermills were built <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> flour, freeing up labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{decided to}} return to a gameplay style similar to the original Genesis Sonic games, which producer Yuji Naka felt was refreshing. Despite this, they also included concepts that were incorporated in the Dreamcast games, such as the ability <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> on rails and and the modernized character designs by Yuji Uekawa. As the Sonic games released for the Dreamcast allowed players to download the Chao Garden minigame onto the VMU, the development team decided to expand upon this idea by implementing a similar minigame that was compatible with the GameCube's GBA link cable, thus making Sonic Advance one of the first games {{to make use of the}} cable. It also makes use of graphical techniques such as rotation effects and Mode 7. The game's musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
40|$|The {{precision}} grinding of hard cemented carbides and brittle ceramics using diamond wheels with continuous electrochemical dressing is considered. A novel grinding apparatus, the electrochemical dressing Miskolc (ECDM), {{was developed and}} used. Higher grinding efficiency was observed as compared <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> using mechanically dressed wheels...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{parameters}} for impact grinding mills were investigated. Final particle size was used <b>to</b> evaluate <b>grinding</b> results. Adjustment of the parameters toward increased charge load results in improved efficiency; however, {{it was not}} possible to define a single, unified set <b>to</b> optimum <b>grinding</b> conditions...|$|R
