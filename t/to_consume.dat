40|$|Having {{replaced}} the diesel locomotives operated in Lithuanian railways by new ones, part of old diesel locomotives (21 units) were renovated. They were equipped with new diesel engines made in Kolomna (Russia). These diesel locomotives {{are used as}} reserve locomotives or for carrying small scope freight on local routes. After a few years from their renovation diesel engines {{as well as the}} locomotives started to fail. Failures happened to be repeated. The article analyses these locomotivesâ€™ failure patterns such as number distribution of engine failures according to locomotive mileage, distribution of engine failures according to diesel locomotive turnover, distribution of engine failure number according <b>to</b> <b>consumed</b> fuel. It suggested to regard the density of engine failure probability according <b>to</b> <b>consumed</b> fuel as one of the indicators of engine reliability...|$|R
