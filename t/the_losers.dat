5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling that sometimes breaks a leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat <b>the</b> <b>losers.</b>|$|E

In addition, he also reluctantly picks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith), but refuses to pick Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) or Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner).|$|E
5|$|In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion {{in which}} Somerset people fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and {{travelled}} north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore {{lead from the}} roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, {{and for a time}} stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil. The Bloody Assizes which followed saw <b>the</b> <b>losers</b> being sentenced to death or transportation.|$|E

5|$|The {{top four}} teams from these groups will {{advance to the}} {{knockout}} playoff stage. In the quarterfinals, the first place team from one group plays the fourth place team from the opposite group, and the second place team from one group plays the third place team from the opposite group. The winners advance to the semi-finals. In cases where the quarter-final venues are deemed too far apart to allow easy travel between them, the teams stay within their groups for the quarters. The winners of the quarter-finals advance to the semi-finals, with {{the winners of the}} semi-finals advancing to the Gold medal game and <b>the</b> <b>losers</b> advancing to the Bronze medal game.|$|E
5|$|Other {{finishing}} {{moves in}} the various Mortal Kombat games include Animalities (introduced in Mortal Kombat 3) turning a victor into an animal to violently finish off the opponent; Brutality (introduced in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) which is bashing an opponent into pieces with a long combo of hits; and Stage Fatalities/Death Traps (introduced in the original Mortal Kombat Pit Stage where the victor can uppercut their opponent off of the platform into a bed of spikes below, and later made more difficult in Mortal Kombat II by requiring specific and different button sequences to be pressed) utilizing parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move (such as a pool of acid). Mortal Kombat: Deception added the Hara-Kiri, a self-Fatality allowing <b>the</b> <b>losers</b> {{to engage in a}} suicide-based finishing move (enabling a possible race between both players to see if the winning player can finish off the losing player before the losing character can kill himself or herself first).|$|E
5|$|Ten {{nations were}} {{entered in the}} tandem competition, {{and in the first}} round, they were drawn with Germany and South Africa, who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom Shardelow and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The Australians made their move too early and led at the ringing of the bell {{at the start of the}} last lap, but they were {{overhauled}} well before the line as they faded in the final straight. Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day. The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance, but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish. This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated, however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle, resulting in a heavy pile-up. Neither teams finished the race, but the Soviets were hospitalised. The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against <b>the</b> <b>losers</b> in the previous repechages to qualify. This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008 Rey Hechicero was {{scheduled}} to team up with Último Guerrero for a Ruelta de la Muerta ("Roulette of death") tournament where <b>the</b> <b>losers</b> of the match advance and the losing team would have to fight each other for their masks. Rey Hechicero suffered an injury shortly before the tournament {{and had to be}} replaced by Difunto II. There was no verification if Rey Hechicero was indeed injured or if the replacement was done because whomever had originally agreed to lose their mask changed their mind and Difunto II agreed to lose his match. Also in 2008 Rey Hechicero began working for a local promotion called Poder Y Honor ("Power and Honor"; PYH) and in 2009 he outlasted Chucho Mar Jr., Estrella Dorada Jr. and Tigre Universitario to become the inargual PYH Heavyweight Champion. In the following years he worked for a number of wrestling promotions as they toured through Monterrey, including winning the mask of Caifán Rockero I on a Perros del Mal show in March 2010. While he began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ("World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) in 2014, he was also allowed to work for various local promotions by CMLL. On December 25, 2014 Rey Hechicero unsuccessfully challenged Black Terry for the FLLM Master Championship on a Cara Lucha show in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl.|$|E

Also, <b>the</b> majority criterion is logically independent from <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> criterion, since <b>the</b> plurality rule satisfies the majority but not <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> criterion, and <b>the</b> anti-plurality rule satisfies <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> but not <b>the</b> majority criterion.
