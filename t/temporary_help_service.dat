The implications of the model for two possible explanations of the secular rise of employment in the <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> industry, technological progress and a rise in firm-level uncertainty, are such that technological progress as an explanation is favored. In the second chapter, I investigate the impact of uncertainty shocks on a dual labor market using the Spanish economy as a case study. In an empirical analysis, I find that, given my identification strategy, fluctuations in uncertainty cause a significant drop in temporary employment, a non-significant reaction in permanent employment and a significant decline in GDP. Since in the data the responses to a second-moment shock are similar to the responses to a first-moment shock, a quantitative labor demand model of the Spanish labor market is built and calibrated. I use this model to generate simulated response functions to a (pure) second-moment, a (pure) first-moment and a combined first- and second moment shock. I find that the empirical impulse responses can only partially be rationalized by the model when considering a (pure) second-moment shock. A (pure) first moment shock in the model generates impulse response functions similar to the empirical ones. A combined first- and second moment shock cannot improve on the first-moment shock in replicating the data...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> {{employment}} on later earnings and employment for individuals participating in three federal programs providing supportive services to those facing employment difficulties. The programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, whose participants are seriously disadvantaged; a job training program with a highly heterogeneous population of participants; and employment exchange services, whose participants consist of Unemployment Insurance claimants and individuals seeking assistant in obtaining employment. We undertake our analyses for two periods: the late 1990 s, a time of very strong economic growth, and shortly after 2000, a time of relative stagnation. Our results suggest that <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> firms may facilitate quicker access to jobs for those seeking employment assistance and impart substantial benefits as transitional employment, especially for individuals whose alternatives are severely limited. Those who do not move out of temporary help jobs, however, face substantially poorer prospects, and we observe that nonwhites are more likely than whites to remain in THS positions in the two years following program participation. Our results are robust to program and time period. ...|$|E

As the usage of temporary hiring services {{over the course of}} the study has continued to increase David Autor attempts to disentangle implied contract's shock from other causes. We evaluate David Autor's empirical study on exceptions to the employment at-will doctrine and how given exceptions affect the US labor markets from the standpoint of <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>services.</b> Autor makes use of a state-level time series aggregate data that follows the employment level and employment characteristics from 1979 to 1995.

Using a smaller sample of data and entropy balancing method we make iterative changes to Autor's regressions to study whether his results can be validated with adjusted data. Entropy balancing is a data pre-processing method that balances control and treatment groups' independent variables prior to regressions. Given that states that adopt and the states that do not adopt the implied contract exception are characteristically very different, entropy balancing could validate Autor's results in a setting where control and treatment states are more comparable. Using entropy balancing and a smaller sample size do not uniformly confirm Autor's hypothesis that implied contract exception cause anz` increase in the usage of temporary hiring services...|$|R

Second, a comparison between THS workers and unemployed persons at a certain point of time shows that those working a THS job can expect a significantly higher income in the following 18 months than those who are unemployed.

40|$|The {{growth rate}} of <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> {{employment}} is often {{considered to be a}} leading business cycle indicator because the firing and hiring of temporary help workers typically lead that of permanent workers. However, few studies in the literature focus on the mechanism that generates the lag between temporary and permanent growth.

Our simple model predicts that the average size of transitory demand shocks increases the lag while the average size of long-lived shocks shortens the lag. Our empirical findings based on cross-city analysis show evidence that supports the above predictions, after controlling for city size, city-specific demographic characteristics, and variables based on the industry mix in the city.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{develops}} {{a method for}} performing inference using spatially dependent data. We consider test statistics formed using nonparametric covariance matrix estimators that account for heteroskedasticity and spatial correlation (spatial HAC). We provide distributions of commonly used test statistics under “fixed-b ” asymptotics, in which HAC smoothing parameters are proportional to the sample size. Under this sequence, spatial HAC estimators are not consistent but converge to non-degenerate limiting random variables that depend on the HAC smoothing parameters and kernel. We show that the limit distributions of commonly used test statistics are pivotal but non-standard, so critical values must be obtained by simulation. We provide a simple and general simulation procedure based on the i. i. d. bootstrap {{that can be used}} to obtain critical values. We illustrate the potential gains of the new approximation through simulations and an empirical example that examines the effect of unjust dismissal doctrine on <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>services</b> employment...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{there is}} {{widespread}} belief that workers in <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>services</b> (THS) are subject to poorer working conditions, in particular pay, than comparable workers {{in the rest of}} the economy, there is little evidence on whether that is driven by the sector per se or by the workers' characteristics. The first aim of this analysis is to quantify the wage penalty, if any, for workers in THS firms. Secondly, we analyze the wage profile of workers right before and after spells of THS. Linked employer-employee data for Portugal enable us to account for observable as well as unobservable worker quality. Our results show that workers in THS firms earn lower wages than their peers and that this difference is mostly due to the workers' characteristics. We estimate that workers in THS firms earn on average 9 % less than comparable workers {{in the rest of the}} economy if we control for the workers' observable attributes only. This difference is reduced to about 1 % when we control for unobservable characteristics as well. However, interesting differences emerge across groups. Younger workers, both men and women, earn higher wages in TAW than their peers in other firms, while the opposite holds for prime-age and older workers. Moreover, for young workers THS firms is not associated with a stigma effect that slows their wage progression after they work for THS, as opposed to prime-age and older workers, in particular males. Also before entering THS the wage trends are different. Prime-age and older workers, both male and female, see their wages deteriorate relative to their peers before entering THS, suggesting that adverse labor market conditions may motivate them to search for a THS job. On the contrary, for young workers we do not detect any pre-THS wage trend. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTemporary work : an enabler for {{boundaryless}} careers ?The aim of {{the present}} paper is to examinate the notion of career applied to the <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> (THS) workers. During the recent period, leader firms in the <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> industry in France are trying to build real “careers” for their temporary employees, by using various methods, such as enabling long-term employment relationships, or making efforts to extend some benefits of the “permanents” employees to the temporary workers (mutual funds, occupational training [...] .). Our ambition is to study the impacts of these evolutions on the temporary employees, by using {{the framework of the}} boundaryless careers [ex: Arthur and Rousseau – on 1996; Cadin and al – on 2003]. We formulate the hypothesis that the professional course of some specific temporary workers (mobile and qualified) can now be viewed as real careers, regarding the framework proposed by the boundaryless careers theorists. To validate this hypothesis, we led a qualitative empirical study (31 interviews conducted with temporary work agency managers), completed by a questionnaire administered to a sample of 208 temporary employees. We then built a typology drawing from the results, based on two criteria (employability and preference for temporary work), which allowed us to isolate a class of “boundaryless temporary workers”. These employees demonstrate four important characteristics:– High level of preference for temporary work;– Strong perceived employability; – Limited perceived job insecurity; – Positive opinion towards the notion of “temporary career”. These results must be considered with caution, because they raised complex institutional and psychological issues concerning the notion of “temporary career”. Institutionally, we can demonstrate that the temporary work legal frame in France is not adapted for workers willing to pursuit a long term career under temporary status. Under a psychological point of view, we notice that the social image of the temporary work remains strongly associated with uncertainty and job insecurity. This social image generates a stigmatization for the long-term temporary workers in their everyday life (ex : discriminations). All these obstacles contribute to explain that the percentage of “boundaryless temporary employees” on our sample is low (15 % of the respondents) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporary}} help {{services industry}} is doing exceptionally well, {{but is it}} doing any good? Previous research on the temporary help services industry tends to fall into two basic categories: 1) research by mainstream labor economists emphasizing the beneficial effects of the industry for workers and consumers of temp labor; or 2) analyses by radical labor economists and sociologists that, in contrast, emphasizes {{the vulnerability of the}} temp industry workforce to direct economic exploitation, and employers’ use of temp labor to bust permanent workers’ labor unions. Some sociological research has examined the temporary services industry {{in the context of the}} welfare reform legislation of the late 1990 s, arguing that the dominant narrative of the success of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act needs to be reconsidered in light of evidence that large numbers of former Temporary Assistance for Needy Families recipients have transitioned from welfare-to-temp work. Our research extends this line of inquiry with an investigation of the relationship between the temp services industry and local level poverty rates and welfare spending. To some extent, our analysis ais inspired by research by Goetz and Swaminathan on the local-level effects of Walmart stores and store openings on poverty rates. In a similar vein, we ask whether changes in the local density and size of the temporary help services industry predict subsequent changes in local poverty rates and local government welfare spending. We analyze these relationships in all counties in the contiguous United States between 2002 and 2007, and include controls for potentially confounding variables, and corrections for endogeneity and spatial dependence. Methods: Using a two-stage regression model, we use a similar method to Goetz and Swaminathan to show the year-to-year change of <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> agencies which helps to reduce potential endogeneity bias in the poverty-change equation...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The {{story of}} the {{explosion}} of temporary employment and the challenge to the permanent employment contract {{in the last half}} of the twentieth century has been told many times. Researchers from 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 a variety of academic disciplines have written about it, as have activists who organize to help American workers maintain a decent standard of living and a modicum of dignity, and policy analysts who fear the degradation of the employment relationship that seems to be a foregone implication of temporary work. They have focused on different units of analysis: workers who desire permanent jobs but can 2 ̆ 7 t find them, workers who have lost out as companies have downsized and restructured, businesses and their myriad reasons for using temporary workers as a solution to their profitability and competition problems, and the <b>temporary</b> <b>help</b> <b>service</b> industry (THS) itself. The Good Temp takes a different tack to explain these developments in labor market institutions and behaviors. Specifically, we look at how the THS industry in the United States reinvented temporary work in the second half of the twentieth century and examine how individual THS agencies continue to manufacture and market this reinvented product—the good temporary worker—today. It is a customized, historically specific make and model whose marketability rested on two selling points: that temporary employment could be a viable alternative to permanent employment and that the workers on whom the system of temporary employment relations depends could be as good as permanent workers and sometimes better. The historical and social construction of 2 ̆ 2 the good temp, 2 ̆ 2 we show, was embedded in THS-industry profitmaking strategies and relied on the diffusion of new norms about what constituted acceptable employment practice. Now entrenched, these norms underpin our current employment relations in the United States which many, if not most, of us experience as precarious and contingent, even when we have so-called permanent jobs...|$|E
