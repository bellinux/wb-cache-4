5|$|The {{text of the}} cantata {{is taken}} from a 1704 {{collection}} of librettos from Meiningen, many {{of which had been}} set to music in the cantatas of Bach's distant cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, Capellmeister at Meiningen. The librettos have been attributed to his employer Duke Ernst Ludwig von Sachsen-Meiningen. The symmetrical structure of seven movements is typical for this collection: the opening quotation from the Old Testament, followed by a recitative and an aria; then the central quotation from the New Testament, followed by an aria and a recitative, leading into the final chorale. The theme of BWV 39 is an invocation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> God's gifts and to share them with the needy.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations {{is that they do}} not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have been times when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize flour. In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{had been}} hailed in Dublin seven years earlier, after the Battle of the Nile, as {{defender of the}} Harp and Crown, the {{respective}} symbols of Ireland and Britain. When news of Trafalgar reached the city on 8 November, there were similar scenes of patriotic celebration, together with a desire that the fallen hero should be commemorated. [...] The mercantile classes had particular reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> a victory that restored {{the freedom of the}} high seas and removed the threat of a French invasion. Many of the city's population had relatives who had been involved in the battle: up to one-third of the sailors in Nelson's fleet were from Ireland, including around 400 from Dublin itself. In his short account of the Pillar, Dennis Kennedy considers that Nelson would have been regarded in the city as a hero, not just among the Protestant Ascendancy [...] but by many Catholics among the rising middle and professional classes.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili (died 1258), {{the founder}} of the Shadhiliyya order, {{introduced}} dhikr jahri (the remembrance of God outloud, as opposed to the silent dhikr). He taught that his followers need not abstain from what Islam has not forbidden, but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> what God has bestowed upon them, in contrast to the majority of Sufis, who preach to deny oneself and to destroy the ego-self (nafs) and its worldly desires. These two ways are sometimes referred to as [...] "Order of Patience" [...] (Tariqus-Sabr), as opposed to the [...] "Order of Gratitude" [...] (Tariqush-Shukr). Imam Shadhili also gave eighteen valuable hizbs (litanies) to his followers out of which the notable Hizb al-Bahr is recited worldwide even today.|$|E
2500|$|Early in his presidency, at {{the request}} of Congress, he issued the first National Thanksgiving Proclamation on October 3, 1789. The {{proclamation}} was sent to the governors of the states, and assigns the day upon which [...] "the people of these States" [...] devote themselves in service to [...] "that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be." [...] It urges the people in the young country to express their gratitude to God for: his protection of them through the Revolutionary War and the peace they had experienced since; for allowing the Constitution to be composed in a [...] "peaceable and rational manner;" [...] for the [...] "civil and religious liberty" [...] they possessed; and [...] "in general, for all the great and various favors which He has been pleased to confer upon us." [...] The proclamation also states that [...] "it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor." [...] It ends by calling the people of the United States to prayer and to beseech God [...] "to pardon our national and other transgressions;" [...] to allow the national government to be wise and just; to [...] "protect and guide" [...] all nations; to promote [...] "true religion and virtue, and the increase of science;" [...] and to [...] "grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as He alone knows to be best." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recent biographies try to {{separate}} fact from legend and counter the folklore of ridicule that had formed around King John and which lacks documentary basis. Lúcia Bastos warns that even today {{we need to}} be careful to place certain matters in their historical context, such as the question of corruption, noting that although there were enormous costs and clear abuses, at that time there was no clear separation between the public treasury and the monarch's private accounts, and in the logic of the Old Regime [...] "the king is the owner of the state... of which the distribution of spoils forms part: the king is the dispenser of justice and spoils". In the words of Leandro Loyola, [...] "from the new research a ruler emerges who had his limitations, but who encountered a totally adverse situation and survived it, despite governing a small, poor, decadent country such as Portugal {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century." [...] Before dying on Saint Helena, his most powerful enemy, Napoleon, said of him: [...] "He was the only one who deceived me." [...] José Joaquim Carneiro de Campos, Marquis of Caravelas, praised him in the Brazilian Senate on the occasion of John's death, saying, [...] "All of us who are here have many reasons to praise the memory of King John VI, we all ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful,</b> <b>for</b> the benefits he gave us: he raised Brazil to a kingdom, provided well for all of us, treated us always with great affection, and all Brazilians are obligated to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Clarissa {{prepares for}} the party she thinks of the famous actor Sally is lunching with, a B-movie action star who {{recently}} came out as gay. This sparks ruminations on why she, Clarissa, was not invited to lunch and again towards thoughts of the worth of her life. In her mind, she is [...] "only a wife" [...] (p94). Clarissa tries <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. She thinks of the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when [...] "it seemed anything could happen, anything at all" [...] (p95). She thinks of kissing Richard, a dramatic reversal of the kiss Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway shares with a girl when she was young. Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent it, so many events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself {{at the time she}} was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, [...] "full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself." [...] "Or then again maybe not," [...] Clarissa thinks. She realizes that maybe there is nothing equal to the recollection of having been young. She catalogues the moment she and Richard kissed for the first time, by a pond's edge at dusk. [...] "It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years, to realize that it 'was' happiness...Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other." ...|$|E
