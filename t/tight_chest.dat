The dried granules were then mixed with lubricant magnesium stearate and glidant talc and compressed into tablets. Subliming agents was sublimed from the tablet by exposing it to drying at 65 0 C. The tablets were evaluated for percentage friability, hardness, weight variation, disintegration time and percentage drug content. Menthol containing tablets resulted in rapid disintegration as compared with tablets containing ammonium bicarbonate and camphor. Formulations F 4 showed the minimum disintegration time of 16 s.

Two CO 2 metrics were constructed: average workday indoor minus average outdoor CO 2 (dCO 2, range 6 - 418 ppm), and maximum indoor one-hour moving average CO 2 minus outdoor CO 2 concentrations (dCO 2 MAX). Multivariate logistic regressions quantified dCO 2 /SBS symptom associations, adjusting for personal and environmental factors.

40|$|Background: Occupational allergy to latex is {{generally}} reported from occupational {{groups such as}} health care workers; however, few reports derive from other occupational settings. Methods: Two male subjects working as loom tuners in a textile manufacturing plant developed severe allergic reactions during the cutting and weaving of elastic bands, initially not suspected to contain latex constituents. Clinical evaluation and lung function tests were supplemented by skin prick testing, specific IgE evaluation and basophil activation assays with extracted elastic bands. Results: Both workers presented with rhinitis, episodes of <b>tight</b> <b>chest</b> and itchy eyes. Initial spirometry was normal with no significant reversibility; however, a histamine challenge test was positive in one worker. Skin prick testing to a battery of common inhalant allergens was negative; however, raised IgE levels were detected to latex using ImmunoCAP. On further testing, the specific IgE response was directed mainly to the major latex allergens rHev b 5, rHev b 6. 01, rHev b 6. 02 and nHev b 13. Basophils of the two workers, but not the unaffected control subjects, were strongly activated by extracts of the elastic and the cutting dust material. Conclusions: Workers are at high risk of becoming sensitised to latex allergens when exposed to excessive dust produced by loom tuning machines. Latex sensitisation should therefore be considered in workers developing unexplained work-related allergic reactions (including asthma) associated with unlabelled materials in the textile industry...|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} including wheezing, <b>tight</b> <b>chest,</b> breathing difficulty, {{are common}} childhood disorders, {{and are the}} most important reasons for (National Health and Medical Research Council 1996; Rumchev, Spickett et al. 2002; Australian Centre for Asthma Monitoring 2005 a) absenteeism in school age children that may decrease the quality of life (Lam, Chung et al. 1998; Penny, Murad et al. 2001). Although genetic background and environmental exposure seem to be the key factors for the development of respiratory symptoms, socio-economic status (SES) may also {{contribute to the development of}} those illnesses in children (Rona 2000). To investigate the extent to which socio-economic factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and asthma in Australia we studied respiratory symptoms and asthma among primary school students from low and high socioeconomic backgrounds. Objective: A cross sectional study to determine the impact of school and domestic indoor air pollution on respiratory symptoms among primary school students from different socio-economic backgrounds (low and high) was conducted within the Perth metropolitan area. The study was carried out in three stages: 1) Questionnaire survey, 2) Indoor air quality monitoring in schools, 3) Indoor air quality monitoring in houses. Methods: We studied 104 primary school students from low and high socioeconomic areas of Perth metropolitan between 2007 and 2008. The respiratory symptoms and asthma were assessed with a standardized questionnaire. Schools and domestic environmental monitoring took place 4 in winter and summer in order to determine seasonal differences in concentrations of studied air pollutants. For this purpose 11 primary schools with low and high socio-economic backgrounds were selected. Domestic air qualities were monitored in 90 houses from each area of low and high socio-economic status. SES was derived from means of more than 2 indicators including education and income. The areas of low and high socio-economic status were also determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Exposure levels to some primary indoor air contaminants including Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) (μg/m 3), formaldehyde (HCHO) (μg/m 3) and particulate matter with size 2. 5 microns in diameter PM 2. 5 (μg/m 3) and PM 10 (μg/m 3) were measured in domestic and schools environments. Indoor temperature (TºC) and relative humidity (RH) (%) were also monitored. Multivariate analyses were then used to quantify the effect of relevant factors on the prevalence of respiratory symptoms. Results: Socioeconomic status is a comprehensive index that refers to a broad range of factors, such as level of social communities, income, education, parental occupations and living conditions. School children from low socioeconomic groups showed more respiratory symptoms in this study. Those who had higher SES had fewer asthma and respiratory symptoms. We conclude that low socioeconomic status is itself a risk factor for respiratory symptoms and asthma among school children. Conclusion: Asthma continues to impose a heavy burden on the nation’s health care expenditures, Reduces productivity, and seriously affects the quality of life for individuals with asthma and their families. Asthma is a public health problem that does not have a. quick fix. It will require the combined efforts of individuals with asthma and their families, health care providers, health care institutions, schools, workplace, governments, voluntary organizations, industry, and the general public. Asthma and respiratory symptoms were more common in low socioeconomic status groups. There was no significant support for the hygiene hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Student Number : 0316118 X - MPH {{research}} report - School of Public Health - Faculty of Health SciencesIntroduction: On {{the weekend of}} 16 – 17 December 1995, the community of Macassar was exposed to elevated levels of sulphur dioxide vapours (SO 2) caused by a fire on a nearby stockpile for approximately 21. 5 hours. It {{has been estimated that}} community members were exposed to levels as high as 200 parts per million (ppm) of this gas as some 15 000 tons of the sulphur stockpile ignited. This resulted in a toxic plume of SO 2 being blown over the Macassar area by the prevailing wind. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the environmental and host factors associated with persistent lower respiratory symptoms among residents of this community six years after being acutely exposed to elevated exposures of SO 2 vapours. Materials and methods: A case-control study was conducted. The cases and controls were selected from adult residents who reported to the Macassar disaster project clinic for a health assessment in order to lodge a medico-legal claim. Survey instruments included a questionnaire, clinical examination and clinical record review by an expert panel. A case was defined as an adult resident who presented to the clinic for an examination with persistent (at year 1 and 6 after the disaster) lower respiratory symptoms. Controls were chosen from clinic attendees without lower respiratory symptoms at year 1 and 6. Environmental exposure was calculated by using the Industrial Source Complex Short Term Model (ISCST 3) to predict time-averaged concentrations at specified receptor locations. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the association between lower persistent respiratory symptoms, host and environmental factors (estimated concentration and duration of exposure to SO 2). Results: A total of 76 cases and 180 controls were selected. The cases and controls were comparable with respect to age, gender, height and smoking status. The results indicated that a medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis at least one year prior to the fire (OR: 3. 5, CI: 1. 5 - 8. 4) was significantly associated with having persistent lower respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, subjects with persistent lower respiratory symptoms were nine times more likely to report symptoms of <b>tight</b> <b>chest</b> (OR: 9. 9; CI: 5. 2 - 19. 1), and twice as likely to report shortness of breath (OR: 2. 0; CI: 1. 0 - 4. 1) at the time of the fire. None of the exposure metrics (total hours of exposure, cumulative exposure, peak exposure) were significantly associated with persistent lower respiratory symptoms. However, peak SO 2 exposure estimated at hour 15 was significantly associated with persistent lower respiratory symptoms (OR: 1. 0; CI: 1. 0 - 1. 1). Discussion: The results of this study are consistent with previous studies reporting lower respiratory tract symptoms after chemical exposure irrespective of age or smoking status. Furthermore, as in other studies respiratory health status was a significant factor in determining susceptibility to SO 2 exposure. Various reports in the literature suggest that exposure > 20 ppm is associated with chronic respiratory symptoms. This however was not demonstrated in this study, using estimates of exposure calculated using the ISCST model suggesting possible exposure misclassification. “Self-selection” bias was an important limitation in this study, since the entire study population was self-referred and as such the study population was not randomly selected. Another limitation is the possibility that there may be potential recall bias operating since the fire incident happened six years ago; however this was considered unlikely as there was nondifferential reporting between cases and control. Self reported symptoms on the questionnaires might have been over-reported due to fear, anxiety and stress or secondary gain related to compensation issues. The lack of association between exposure variables and persistent asthma may have also been due to lack of power (small sample size), although this was thought to be a minor contributory factor. Conclusion: Host-related factors such as a previous history of pulmonary TB and acute asthma-like symptoms at the time of the fire were important predictors of persistent lower respiratory symptoms reported by residents 6 years after acute exposure to SO 2 vapours emanating from a sulphur fire...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY A 19 {{year old}} woman with Ullrich-Noonan {{syndrome}} {{presented with a}} six month history of progressive dyspnoea and cyanosis. Clinical features were suggestive of severe pulmonary hypertension. Cross sectional echocardiography showed pronounced right ventricular pressure overload with right ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac catheterisation confirmed severe pulmonary hypertension. Attempts to reduce pulmonary artery pressure with calcium channel blockers were unsuccessful. The patient died shortly after investigation. Necropsy confirmed primary pulmonary hypertension. The Ullrich-Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition of both sexes in which the affected individuals have many of the phenotypic features of Turner's syndrome, but with a normal karyotype and normal secondary sexual characteris-tics. There is a predisposition to cardiac anomalies, the most commonly described being pulmonary valve stenosis (often associated with an atrial septal defect) and asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. " We report a case of severe primary pulmonary hyperten-sion occurring in association with this syndrome and describe the clinical features and pathological find-ings of a plexogenic arteriopathy. Case report A 19 year old woman was admitted to hospital with a six month history of progressive dyspnoea on exer-tion.

Thus, if my enemy passed an uninhabited house, he would see his conscience glaring down on him from the parapets, and peeping up at him from the cellars. If he took a dead wall in his walk, it would be alive with reproaches. If he sought refuge in an omnibus, the panels thereof would become Belshazzar's palace to him. If he took boat, in a wild endeavour to escape, he would see the fatal words lurking under the arches of the bridges over the Thames. If he walked the streets with downcast eyes, he would recoil from the very stones of the pavement, made eloquent by lamp-black lithograph. If he drove or rode, his way would be blocked up by enormous vans, each proclaiming the same words over and over again from its whole extent of surface. Until, having gradually grown thinner and paler, and having at last totally rejected food, he would miserably perish, and I should be revenged. This conclusion I should, no doubt, celebrate by laughing a hoarse laugh in three syllables, and folding my arms <b>tight</b> upon my <b>chest</b> agreeably to most of the examples of glutted animosity that I have had an opportunity of observing in connexion with the Drama - which, by-the-by, as involving a good deal of noise, appears to me to be occasionally confounded with the Drummer.|$|R
