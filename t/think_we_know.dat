As she stated, [...] "I find it a {{fascinating}} period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of the things we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E
500|$|Although the British Hurricane {{device was}} more {{advanced}} than the American Fat Man bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology, and while British and Soviet advances had taken much of the heat out of American opposition to renewed cooperation with the British, the United States Congress saw little benefit {{in it for the}} United States. The McMahon Act was amended by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations, on 30 August 1954, but it fell far short of what the British government wanted. Churchill, who had replaced Attlee as prime minister, turned to Lord Cherwell for advice on the prospect of producing a British hydrogen bomb. Cherwell reported that [...] "We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> how to make an H-bomb", but Penney did not agree with this sanguine assessment.|$|E
500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{who have}} {{summarised}} {{the plot of}} Finnegans Wake include Joseph Campbell, John Gordon, Anthony Burgess, William York Tindall, and Philip Kitcher. While no two summaries interpret the plot in the same way, {{there are a number}} of central [...] "plot points" [...] upon which they find general agreement. A number of Joyce scholars question the legitimacy of searching for a linear storyline within the complex text. As Bernard Benstock highlights, [...] "in a work where every sentence opens a variety of possible interpretations, any synopsis of a chapter is bound to be incomplete." [...] David Hayman has suggested that [...] "For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the Wake, it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold." [...] The book's challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes, prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of [...] "boiling down" [...] Finnegans Wake into [...] "insipid pap, and leaving the lazy reader with a predigested mess of generalizations and catchphrases." [...] Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses, saying [...] "we have some traditional summaries, also some put in circulation by Joyce himself. I find them most unsatisfactory and unhelpful, they usually leave out the hard parts and recirculate what we already <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> I simply cannot believe that FW would be as blandly uninteresting as those summaries suggest." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{even more}} visible {{holdover}} was the 'signs' segment. [...] This would begin when Springsteen collected request signs from the pit audience as an extended introduction to [...] "Raise Your Hand" [...] was played. [...] Once that song completed, Springsteen selected {{two or three}} numbers to play from the requests. [...] The first was often a garage rock classic such as [...] "Wild Thing", [...] "96 Tears", or [...] "Mony Mony" [...] or a punk rock staple such as [...] "I Wanna Be Sedated" [...] or [...] "London Calling". [...] This activity was billed as [...] "Stump the Band", and led to impromptu arrangements being worked out onstage. [...] Springsteen would sometimes taunt the audience afterwards with declarations that the E Street Band could not be stumped, such as saying in Atlanta's Philips Arena, [...] "...this is the greatest bar band in the land, and if they don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> 96 fuckin' Tears!" [...] The immediate introduction of the signs segment surprised even E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren, who thought Springsteen would hold it off until later in the tour. [...] The precise degree of challenge in this segment was unclear, as lyrics were often loaded into the teleprompter that Springsteen uses {{and in some cases}} the songs had been soundchecked earlier. [...] In any case, most of the challenges were to the band's shared knowledge of British Invasion, Motown, Stax-Volt, and other 1960s material. [...] Springsteen subsequently said, [...] "we started to take unusual requests and do songs that we'd never played before, just depending on the common memory that the band would have from everyone's individual playing experience as teenagers. We ended up with a system where we can jump on a lot pretty quick." [...] Other honored sign requests were usually for Springsteen songs not normally in the set list.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> isn't everything there is to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} B. In her recap, she points out: [...] "With “Souls Of The Departed” Once Upon a Time, believe it or not, has just crossed a key threshold: 100 episodes. For all this show's inanities and love of catchphrases and gaping plot holes where logic should exist, there's clearly something very compelling about Storybrooke and its residents that resonates with viewers. In my own home, it's a decent family watch, that the kids find intriguing and even occasionally scary enough not to be lame, and the adults in the house can still take an interest. And the show still finds surprising mileage out of turning fairy tale tropes on their ear, or offering different sides of characters we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rationalism {{is often}} contrasted with empiricism. Taken very broadly these views are not {{mutually}} exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist. Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us a posteriori, that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge a priori– {{through the use of}} logic– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as Galen Strawson once wrote, [...] "you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science." [...] Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of epistemology, their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the theory of justification.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is beyond}} {{question}} that Good News intends {{to use the}} public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves {{in an act of}} Christian conversion. [...] The majority avoids this reality only by resorting to the bland and general characterization of Good News's activity as 'teaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint'. [...] If the majority's statement ignores reality, as it surely does, then today's holding may be understood only in equally generic terms. [...] Otherwise, indeed, this case would stand for the remarkable proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must be opened for use as a church, synagogue, or mosque. [...] Souter also disputed that it was proper for the Court to reach the Establishment Clause claim. [...] Neither the district court nor the Second Circuit had based their rulings on the Establishment Clause, because they had found no First Amendment violation stemming from Milford's actions. [...] Consequently, the facts relating to the Establishment Clause claim were not as well developed as they otherwise might have been. [...] Furthermore, Souter disagreed that this case was so similar to Widmar and Lamb's Chapel as the majority claimed. [...] Widmar involved a university student group, one of over a hundred on campus, that used university space for religious worship. [...] In that case, Souter pointed out, the risk of the university being seen as endorsing the worship was low in light of the number of student groups on campus and the level of maturity of the students. [...] The film in Lamb's Chapel was open to the general public and aimed at adults, not children, and the school facilities had been used by a wide variety of private organizations, just as there were a large number of student groups in Widmar. [...] The Good News Club, by contrast, began setting up its meetings almost half an hour before the school day ended and in a classroom adjacent to the third- and fourth-grade classroom, so that those students, at least, would see the Club every time it came to campus. [...] In view {{of the state of the}} recorde, the [...] "facts we know (or <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know)</b> point away from the majority's conclusion, and while the consolation may be that nothing really gets resolved when the judicial process is so truncated, that is not much to recommend today's result." ...|$|E
