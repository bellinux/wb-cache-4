5|$|Llandaff Cathedral {{was built}} on the site of an {{existing}} church. According to tradition, the community was established by Saint Dubricius at a ford on the River Taff and the first church was founded by Dubricius' successor, Saint Teilo. These two are regarded as the cathedral's patron saints, along with their successor Oudoceus. The original church is no longer extant, but a standing Celtic cross <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of Christian worship at the site in pre-Norman times.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the Byzantine-era church in Jifna <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} of a Christian community prior to the Muslim conquest. It continued to exist during the Middle Ages and the village is still inhabited mainly by Christians. The names of Christian inhabitants from Jifna appeared in a 10th-century inscription on a stone above the gate of St. George's Monastery in the Wadi Qelt.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora {{high up in}} the mountains to the south of Cortina <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E

5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There {{is reason to believe}} that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli to that of the Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E

25|$|The Romanesque castle <b>testifies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{triumph of}} rural nobility {{and is also}} the symbol of a territory's safety.

The second half of the inscription is in the fornyrðislag meter.|$|E
25|$|Giuseppe Garibaldi {{landed in}} Sicily in 1860 and many reforms took place. On July 1, 1860, a town council was {{installed}} in Adrano, and don Lorenzo Ciancio was made chairman.
