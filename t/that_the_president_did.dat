5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} sessions before the trip, Kennedy had {{run through a}} number of sentences, even paragraphs, to recite in German; in these sessions, he was helped by Margaret Plischke, a translator working for the US State Department; by Ted Sorensen, Kennedy's counsel and habitual speechwriter; and by an interpreter, Robert Lochner, who had grown up in Berlin. It became clear quickly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not have a gift for languages and was more likely to embarrass himself if he was to cite in German for any length.|$|E
25|$|Justice Clark, who {{had been}} Truman's Attorney General for four years before Truman {{appointed}} him to the Court, rejected Black's and Douglas' absolutist approach, holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> have some inherent power {{to act in the}} case of grave and imperative national emergencies. Clark refused, however, to define the boundaries of that power; in his view the fact that Congress had provided in the Taft–Hartley Act, the Selective Service Act or the Defense Production Act for procedures that the executive could have used, ended the discussion by barring the President from relying on any inherent powers he might otherwise have to choose a solution other than the ones that Congress had allowed.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>president</b> {{may also}} {{dissolve}} the National Council, but only once {{for the same}} reason during his term of office. Note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not have <b>the</b> power to veto specific acts of legislation: no matter how vehemently he objects to some particular bill, or believes it to be unconstitutional, all he can actually do is threaten to dismiss the government or dissolve the National Council before the bill is actually passed.|$|R
50|$|While in the House, Polis {{has been}} a staunch {{advocate}} for civil liberties, saying while campaigning in 2008 that “balance must be restored between the executive and the judicial branch (through restoring Habeas corpus, and clarifying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have <b>the</b> Constitutional authority to alter legislation through signing statements,) and between the executive and the legislative branch (clarifying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Amendment requires probable cause and a warrant {{for the government to}} monitor Americans).|$|R
25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and {{was required to}} act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Reagan {{visited a}} German {{military}} cemetery in Bitburg {{to lay a}} wreath with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of the Waffen-SS. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves [...] "victims," [...] a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of the Holocaust; Pat Buchanan, Reagan's Director of Communications, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust, but as victims of the ideology of Nazism. Now strongly urged to cancel the visit, the president responded {{that it would be}} wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl. He ultimately attended the ceremony where two military generals laid a wreath.|$|E
500|$|On 12April, {{opposition}} leaders appear on private television, where they disclose their plan to unseat Chávez. Carmona is {{sworn in as}} president while images play of unrest on the streets. Defying media censorship, Chávez's supporters disseminate the story <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not resign. On 13April, they gather to protest outside Miraflores, while palace guards plot to retake the building. The guards take up key positions and, at a prearranged signal, take {{members of the new}} government prisoner. The state television channel is relaunched and urges the army to back Chávez. [...] "Full military control" [...] is returned to the Chávez administration and the president arrives at the palace amid celebratory scenes. Chávez makes an address in which he says it is fine to oppose him, but not the Constitution of Venezuela. The closing titles say Carmona fled to Miami while under house arrest, and that Ortega went into hiding, only reappearing to help lead the opposition after Chávez said there would be no repercussions. Most of the dissident generals, after being expelled from the army, fled to the US. Others remained as part of the opposition.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2003, the Iraq Resolution was {{challenged}} {{in court to}} stop the invasion from happening. <b>The</b> plaintiffs argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have <b>the</b> authority to declare war.

50|$|Article 11 of the {{constitution}} lays out {{the process by which}} <b>the</b> <b>president</b> can be removed from office. It states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not bear responsibility for the actions of his government and that he can not be prosecuted without consent of the Parliament. A referendum instigated by the Parliament with 3/4 support must approve of his removal. Once the Parliament has approved of <b>the</b> referendum, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> must temporarily step aside until the results of the referendum are known. The referendum must be held within two months of the vote, and, should the removal be rejected by the people, then the Parliament must immediately be dissolved and a new general election held.|$|R
5000|$|On June 26, 2014, the United States Supreme Court {{rejected}} both holdings, {{while also}} unanimously deciding that President Obama overreached his executive authority in appointing {{members to the}} NLRB while the Senate was still formally in session. Justice Stephen Breyer, in the majority opinion, wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Constitution allows for the Congress itself to determine its sessions and recesses, that [...] "the Senate is in session when it says it is," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have <b>the</b> unilateral right to dictate Congressional sessions and thus make recess appointments. However, the decision allows the use of recess appointments during breaks within a session for vacancies that existed prior to the break.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{in a third}} case, {{the special}} review court for FISA, the {{equivalent}} of a Circuit Court of Appeals, opined differently should FISA limit the President's inherent authority for warrantless searches in the foreign intelligence area. In In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 742 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. of Rev. 2002) the special court stated [...] "ll the other courts to have decided the issue [...] held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information [...] ...

2500|$|In May 2012, President Jonathan {{changed the}} name of the University of Lagos to the Moshood Abiola University in honour of the late MKO Abiola. The action drew {{attention}} from critics; among them were pro-Abiola advocates and parties involved with the university. Some critics cited <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not submit an appropriate bill to the legislature for the change; that the University's brand name should not be tampered with. The UNILAG Alumni Association commented that although they do not have prejudice against MKO Abiola, they were concerned [...] "that neither the Governing Council nor the University Senate nor any other stakeholder was consulted before the change was announced." [...] Bola Tinubu congratulated Jonathan for taking action, but urged him to [...] "do it right", adding that [...] "we must be careful not to localise or sectionalise MKO". The President has attempted to regularise the renaming of the school by submitting a bill for an amendment of the University's establishing law to the legislature.|$|E

2500|$|Most of <b>the</b> {{arguments}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> {{not possess}} soft power {{stem from a}} strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> First, unless <b>the</b> Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has to act according to {{the advice of the}} Cabinet. In the context of the Constitution, the word advice does not carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have any liberty to exercise soft power. Furthermore, it has been argued <b>that</b> since <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|R
5000|$|President George W. Bush was {{a proponent}} of the unitary {{executive}} theory and cited it within his Signing statements about legislation passed by Congress.
