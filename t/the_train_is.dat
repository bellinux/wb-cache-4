5|$|After {{the journey}} restarts, the train enters a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log flume attraction, crosses a trestle {{bridge over the}} Critter Country section, wraps around the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, and rolls through another tunnel before {{reaching}} Mickey's Toontown Depot between the Mickey's Toontown and Fantasyland sections. While <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> stopped at this station, a non-functioning water tower {{can be seen on}} the opposite side of the track to the station's depot building.|$|E
5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Karelian Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using {{a new model of}} the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant difference is that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E
50|$|Working on <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>was</b> dangerous, {{eight men}} working on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>were</b> killed in 1893 {{and two were}} injured. Two other employees, three {{passengers}} and two unrelated people off of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>were</b> also injured.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> going via Bina Junction. The {{important}} halt of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>were</b> Katni, Damoh, Sagar, Khurai, Bina and Vidisha.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} running between Thiruvananthapuram Central and Ernakulam Junction via Alappuzha. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> extended till Kozhikode in August 2009.|$|R
5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in a vertical position {{in order to}} allow riders to board. Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E
5|$|Once in the station, riders of Sky Scrapper board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness is locked in place. After <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> fully locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position and depart the station.|$|E
5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience {{a moment of}} free-falling {{with at least one}} near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop, a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a holding brake which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop. After a few seconds, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> released into the drop.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} used sparingly {{to avoid}} electrical breakdowns. From 1995 <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> used more intensively and second class was introduced.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> used to {{run with}} an average speed of 63 km/h. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{used to run}} on daily basis from both the sites.|$|R
5000|$|A probe by the Vietnamese police {{department}} found that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> travelling {{at a speed}} of 68 km/h when it derailed, or 20 km/h more than the stipulated speed limit of 40 km/h. Witnesses reported that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> travelling at a high speed {{at the time of}} the incident, with one passenger claiming that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> had <b>been</b> [...] "gathering speed" [...] just before <b>the</b> derailment. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> reportedly 20 minutes behind schedule at the time.|$|R
5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown on the {{aircraft}} carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister {{on a visit}} to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only when <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> stationary or approaching a railway station.|$|E
5|$|The train {{entered the}} regular revenue service on November 11, 1934, between Kansas City, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; and Lincoln, Nebraska. It {{operated}} {{this and other}} routes until its retirement in 1960, when it was donated to Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, where it remains on public display. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> generally regarded as the first successful streamliner on American railroads.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops once {{daily in}} each {{direction}} at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Station. Ridership on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> increasing, about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. Increased ridership has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's service in the area. Saint Paul {{is the site of}} the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} around 2005.The <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced as}} a bi-weekly for initial years, and then existed as a tri-weekly train for some later years. At present <b>the</b> <b>train</b> runs {{five times a}} week. Later-on the second version of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 2009. It had a longer route than <b>the</b> parent <b>train.</b> It <b>was</b> introduced as a bi-weekly <b>train.</b> It <b>was</b> an alternative <b>train</b> for trains like Goa Express, Jhelum Express and Hazrat Nizamuddin - Mysore Swarna Jayanti Express. Mainly <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> introduced for passengers of Hubli and Pune.|$|R
50|$|This <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} in 1904 {{after the completion}} of Quilon-Sengottai-Virudhunagar meter gauge line and was flagged off by then Maharaja of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> later renamed <b>the</b> Quilon-Madras mail. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> extended to Trivandrum in 1918 after completion of the Quilon-Trivandrum meter gauge line. This <b>train</b> <b>was</b> one of <b>the</b> early meter gauge trains to have an air conditioned coach and First Class. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> truncated at Quilon after Kollam -Trivandrum Central meter gauge track was converted to broad gauge in 1979. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> by through Madurai junction railway station from 1996 via Manamadurai Junction when Virudhunagar-Madurai line was converted to broad gauge. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in June 2000.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> second batch <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> {{numbered}} 341-26~341-30; <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> renumbered from <b>trains</b> 2-77~2-81.|$|R
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running {{to catch a glimpse of}} <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is not the end of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the signal}} {{light in the}} {{locomotive}} turns green, the journey from the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage area can be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's block signal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{also known}} as Ajmeri Express which signifies the nearby {{destination}} of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> that <b>is</b> Ajmer ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> {{owned by}} Karelian Trains, a 50-50 {{joint venture between}} VR Group (Finnish Railways) and Russian Railways (RZD). <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> able to run on both Finnish and Russian tracks.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{investigation}} {{suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> traveling at about 60 km/h, which {{is above the}} 40 km/h speed limit. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> unable to slow sufficiently to get around a curve in the track and derailed. According to a government spokesman, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> apparently <b>was</b> speeding because of an engine failure.|$|R
5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard. Themed {{to the popular}} comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three Six Flags theme parks around the United States: Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Great America. The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.|$|E
5|$|The Governor's Daughter is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story details a convict who is being sent to prison when <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> wrecked and the sheriff escorting him is killed. The convict frees himself, but halts his escape {{to save the life}} of a little girl. As he returns the girl to her nurse, a policeman identifies and recaptures him. Later the little girl accompanies her father, the governor, on a tour of the prison and the father pardons the hero-convict. The film included scenes of a real train wreck and the scenario was written around the filming of the disaster. The film received praise for the before and after scenes which were described as shocking to The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer. The film was released on June 24, 1910, and was shown as far away as Australia. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The Pendolino is {{designed}} as a premium facility train. The seats are fitted with audio sockets for radio and music channels; however the radio service was dropped in 2010 due to low usage. All seats have electricity sockets for laptops and mobile phones. All Sm3 trains offer a free onboard Wi-Fi Internet access since 2010. The passenger information monitors over the aisle in the carriages show a clock and the train's current speed in addition to VR's marketing material and station information. They are also used to convey passenger information for the deaf. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> accessible for wheelchairs, contains pet spaces and seats for allergic passengers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{also known}} as Ajmeri Link Express which signifies the nearby {{destination}} of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> that <b>is</b> Ajmer ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} named Maverick and Iceman, {{going along}} with the callsigns of the two pilots in the Top Gun film. For the 2010 season, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> renamed Firehawk and Raptor.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of Class 351000 <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> built from 1993 to 1999 by Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries. Because of the flat front ends, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> nicknamed [...] "flat face" [...] (납작이). <b>The</b> {{first generation}} <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> numbered 351-01~351-22; <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> renumbered from <b>trains</b> 2-47~2-48, 2-50, 2-55~2-69, and 2-73~2-76.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} {{equipped}} with a shed, but no other amenities, and also lacks a ticket machine. The platform (but not necessarily <b>the</b> <b>train)</b> <b>is</b> wheelchair accessible. There are about ten parking spaces at the station. A shuttle bus corresponds to all trains during the opening hours of the airport, and a bus trip takes four minutes to the airport terminal. The shuttle bus leaves the airport ten minutes before each train's scheduled departure. The bus is operated by NSB, and is included in the price of the train ticket. There are 42 bus departures each day. The train supplements a coach service, Torp Expressen operated by UniBuss, to Oslo, and a local bus service to Sandefjord, operated by Vestviken Kollektivtrafikk.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> {{dispatched}} {{and enters}} Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in}} a graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the scene, riders who began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next scene. Riders who were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the scene a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash {{at the end of the}} scene. The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E
50|$|Following Napoleon's defeat, <b>the</b> <b>Train</b> <b>was</b> {{reduced to}} five troops, {{primarily}} utilised for mundane transport tasks. By 1818, only two troops remained, with one stationed in Gibraltar. <b>The</b> <b>Train</b> <b>was</b> finally disbanded in 1833.|$|R
25|$|As the Rocky Mountain Rocket was {{downgraded}} due to non-rail competition, {{the route}} traveled by <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> shortened from <b>the</b> western terminal at Denver, first to Omaha, then to Council Bluffs and <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> renamed <b>The</b> Cornhusker. In 1970, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{cut to a}} Chicago to Rock Island run, a run entirely {{within the confines of}} the State of Illinois and finally renamed the Quad Cities Rocket.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} diagram, the two ends of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>are</b> drawn as grey lines. Because {{the ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>are</b> {{stationary}} {{with respect to the}} observer on <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> these lines <b>are</b> just vertical lines, showing their motion through time but not space. The flash of light is shown as the 45° red lines. The points at which the two light flashes hit the ends of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>are</b> at <b>the</b> same level in the diagram. This means that the events are simultaneous.|$|R
