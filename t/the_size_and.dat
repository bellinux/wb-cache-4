5|$|Following the Babylonians, {{significant}} {{advances in}} astronomy {{were made in}} ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> distance of the Moon and Sun, {{and was the first}} to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading {{are widely}} used to create {{products}} to fit selected populations.

This study proposes a new technique to use principal component analysis (PCA) on 3 D surface points for <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading wearable products. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated by developing a <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading rule for the feet. After developing a model using the feet data of 60 participants and validating using the feet data of 10 different participants, results showed that <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading using PCA is more accurate than traditional techniques. Compared with traditional foot sizing, PCA based <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> grading showed an improvement of about 25 % in accuracy. In addition, results also indicated that the grading rule derived from PCA loading was better than the proportional grading.
