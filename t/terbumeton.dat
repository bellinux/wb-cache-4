As rubber accelerators, these compounds modify the rate of vulcanization or rubber. A variety of pesticides are derived from this amine, including terbacil, terbutryn, and <b>terbumeton.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of grafting polymerization {{has been used}} for preparation of thin films of molecularly imprinting polymers on the surface of polypropylene membranes and on hydrophobized gold electrodes. The herbicide desmetryn was used as a template. The solid supports used were hydrophobic, while the polymerwas hydrophilic. The adsorbed layer of benzophenone, irradiated by UV-light, initiated a radical polymerization near the surface. Polymer films were characterized by weighing, contact angle measurements and impedance spectroscopy. The electrodes coated with the molecularly imprinted polymers displayed fairly specific binding of desmetryn, as detected by the decrease in the capacitance of the electrode. Only small capacitive effects were observed on addition of <b>terbumeton</b> or atrazine, while metribuzine displayed capacitance decrease similar to desmetryn...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{electrochemical}} DNA-biosensor {{has been}} used to investigate the interactions between DNA and members of a group of ten derivatives of 1, 3, 5 -triazine herbicides: chloro-s-triazines (atrazine, propazine, terbutylazin, and cyanazin), thiomethyl-s-triazines (ametryn, prometryn, terbutryn, and simetryn), and methoxy-s-triazines (prometon and <b>terbumeton).</b> A UV spectrophotometric study of this group of herbicides was also undertaken. Of this group only cyanazin could be oxidized in aqueous solution using a glassy carbon electrode. Use of the electrochemical DNA-biosensor revealed the occurrence of a time-dependent interaction of all the herbicides with DNA, via the appearance of guanine, guanosine, and adenosine oxidation signals that correspond to DNA damage. Adduct formation between the herbicide and the DNA purine bases guanine and adenine is suggested as a mechanism...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} {{on the presence}} and changes over time of pesticide residues in groundwater from the Valencia region, {{one of the most}} important citrus cultivation sites of southern Europe. A multiresidue LC-MS/MS method was applied for the screening of around 50 pesticides in 75 water samples collected during 2000. The herbicides simazine, terbuthylazine, bromacil, <b>terbumeton,</b> and diuron were the most frequently detected compounds. On the basis of compounds detected in these samples, another method that focused on 30 herbicides and relevant transformation products (TPs) was developed and applied to around 80 water samples collected during 2003. Simazine was the most frequently found compound followed by several triazine metabolites. Data for this paper show the vulnerability of groundwater in this area to herbicide applications and illustrate the importance of including pesticide TPs in environmental monitoring programmes, as four out of the five compounds most frequently detected were pesticide TP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Prometon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consistently}} detected herbicides in the U. S. environment. However, no previous assessment of the potential for prometon or related methoxytriazine herbicides to act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been conducted. This study used an array of in vitro bioassays to assess whether prometon, atraton, <b>terbumeton,</b> or secbumeton might act as potent (ant) agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon, estrogen, androgen, or glucocorticoid receptors or as aromatase inhibitors or inducers in vitro. Potential effects of prometon were also evaluated using a 21 -d fathead minnow reproduction assay. Concentrations of methoxytriazines, as great as 1 mg/L (4. 4 �M), did not induce significant dioxin-like responses in H 4 IIE-luc cells, estrogenic responses in MVLN cells, or androgen or glucocorticoid receptor–mediated responses in MDA-kb 2 cells, nor did the methoxytriazines significantly affect aromatase activity in vitro. In the fathead minnow assay, exposure to 20, 200, or 1, 000 �g prometon/L significantly reduced the weight of the male fat pad (an androgen-responsive tissue) relative to body weight. Exposure to 20 �g prometon/...|$|E
40|$|A {{selective}} extraction technique {{based on the}} combination of membrane assisted solvent extraction and molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction for triazine herbicides in food samples was developed. Simazine, atrazine, prometon, <b>terbumeton,</b> terbuthylazine and prometryn were extracted from aqueous food samples into a hydrophobic polypropylene membrane bag containing 1000 mu L of toluene as the acceptor phase along with 100 mg of MIP particles. In the acceptor phase, the compounds were re-extracted onto MIP particles. The extraction technique was optimised {{for the type of}} organic acceptor solvent, amount of molecularly imprinted polymers particles in the organic acceptor phase, extraction time and addition of salt. Toluene as the acceptor phase was found to give higher triazine binding onto MIP particles compared to hexane and cyclohexane. Extraction time of 120 min and 100 mg of MIP were found to be optimum parameters. Addition of salt increased the extraction efficiency for more polar triazines. The selectivity of the technique was demonstrated by extracting spiked cow pea and corn extracts where clean chromatograms were obtained compared to only membrane assisted solvent extraction or only molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction. The study revealed that this combination may be a simple way of selectively extracting compounds in complex samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Emerging drugs of abuse, {{belonging}} to many different chemical classes, are attracting users {{with promises of}} “legal” highs and easy access via internet. Prevalence of their consumption and abuse through wastewater-based epidemiology can only be realized if a suitable analytical screening procedure exists to detect and quantify them in water. Solid-phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC–QqTOF–MS/MS) was applied for rapid suspect screening {{as well as for}} the quantitative determination of 42 illicit drugs and metabolites in water. Using this platform, we were able to identify amphetamines, tryptamines, piperazines, pyrrolidinophenones, arylcyclohexylamines, cocainics, opioids and cannabinoids. Additionally, paracetamol, carbamazepine, ibersartan, valsartan, sulfamethoxazole, <b>terbumeton,</b> diuron, etc. (including degradation products as 3 -hydroxy carbamazepine or deethylterbuthylazine) were detected. This method encompasses easy sample preparation and rapid identification of psychoactive drugs against a database that cover more than 2000 compounds that ionized in positive mode, and possibility to identify metabolites and degradation products as well as unknown compounds. The method for river water, influent and effluents samples was fully validated for the target psychoactive substances including assessment of matrix effects (- 88 – 67. 8 %), recovery (42 – 115 %), precision (< 19 %) and limits of quantification (1 – 100 ng L). Method efficiency was thoroughly investigated for a wide range of waste and surface waters. Robust and repeatable functioning of this platform in the screening, identification and quantification of traditional and new psychoactive drugs biomarkers and other water contaminants is demonstrated. This work has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) through the project, GCL 2015 - 64454 -C 2 - 1 -R and the University of Valencia through the project (UV-INV-AE 15 - 348995).

40|$|This work {{describes}} the optimization, validation and application to real samples of an ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the quantification and confirmation of 11 compounds (atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, <b>terbumeton,</b> terbutryn and their main transformation products) in surface and wastewater samples. Most of these analytes {{are included in}} the list of priority substances in the framework on European Water Policy. The application of this method to water samples reveals that the most relevant transformation products (TPs) should be incorporated into current analytical methods (which are focused mainly on the determination of unchanged compounds), to obtain a more realistic knowledge on water quality regarding pesticide contamination. TPs are generally more polar and mobile than the parents and they can be transported to the aquatic environment more rapidly than their precursors. Additionally, they can present some degree of toxicity and in fact TPs are also included within the legislation on drinking water as pesticide derivatives. To efficiently combine UHPLC with MS/MS, a fast-acquisition triple quadrupole mass analyzer was used. Working in selected reaction monitoring mode, up to three simultaneous transitions per compound were acquired allowing a reliable identification at ng/L levels. The method developed includes a pre-concentration step based on solid-phase extraction (OASIS HLB cartridges). Satisfactory recoveries (70 - 120 %) and relative standard deviations (< 20 %) were obtained for all compounds in different water samples types spiked at two concentration levels (0. 025 and 0. 1 μg/L). The optimized method was found to have excellent sensitivity with instrumental detection limits as low as 50 fg. In addition, the influences of the matrix constituents on ionization efficiency and extraction recovery have been studied in different types of Italian and Spanish surface and urban wastewater. Signal suppressions were observed for all compounds, especially for influent wastewater. The use of isotope-labelled internal standards was found to be the best approach to assure an accurate quantification in all matrix sample...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} {{of a wide variety}} of organic pollutants with different physico-chemical characteristics has been investigated in wastewater samples from a municipal solid waste treatment plant placed at Castellón, Spain. An advanced analytical strategy has been applied, consisting on the combined used of two powerful and complementary techniques, GC and LC, both hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole analyzers. The GC-MS/MS method was based on sample extraction using C 18 SPE cartridges and allowed the determination of around 60 compounds from different chemical families, such as PAHs, octyl/nonyl phenols, PCBs, organochlorine compounds, insecticides, herbicides and PBDEs. Most of compounds selected are included as priority contaminants in the European Union (EU) Water Directive. The UHPLC-MS/MS method, which provided high chromatographic resolution and sensitivity and short analysis time, used a sample extraction with OASIS HLB SPE cartridges and allowed the determination of 37 (more polar) pesticides. The methodology developed has been applied to the analysis of 41 water samples (20 non-treated, raw leachates, and 21 treated) collected between March 2007 and February 2009. Treated (reverse osmosis) water samples analyzed rarely exceeded 0. 5 μg/L for the contaminants investigated. As expected, in non-treated leachates the number of detections and the concentration levels found were notably higher than in treated waters. The most commonly detected pollutants were herbicides (simazine, terbuthylazine, terbutryn, <b>terbumeton,</b> terbacil and diuron), together with fungicides (thiabendazole and carbendazim) and 4 -t-octylphenol. In the light of data obtained, it has been proven that reverse osmosis process used for water treatment was efficient and notably reduced the levels of organic contaminants found in raw leachate samples. 2 In order to investigate the {{presence of}} other non-target contaminants, water samples were also analyzed by using GC-TOF MS and LC-QTOF MS. Several organic pollutants that did not form a part of the previous list of target contaminants were identified in the samples, thanks to the good sensitivity of TOF MS in full spectrum acquisition mode and the valuable accurate mass information provided by these instruments. The insecticide diazinon, the fungicide diphenylamide, the UV filter benzophenone, N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA), the insect repellent diethyltoluamide, caffeine or pharmaceuticals like erythromycin, benzenesulfonanilide, ibruprofen, atenolol or paracetamol, were some of the compounds identified in the water samples analyzed...|$|E
