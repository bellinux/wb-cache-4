5|$|The CS gas {{canisters}} {{and content}} used were {{purchased by the}} Hong Kong SAR Government from CHEMRING, a British weapons manufacturer. The crowd used umbrellas <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> the gas, often ineffectively.|$|E
5|$|The story {{ends with}} the barbarians {{retreating}} from Rome, disheartened {{by the loss of}} their leader, and with Marius being posthumously hailed as a hero for his efforts <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> their attacks.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to the Marshall Plan as an important application of moral law to public policy. He said that the plan’s true purpose was <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> Communism through the economic restoration of Europe—not to provide relief to Europe (something beyond {{the powers of the}} U.S.), nor to enhance gratitude towards the U.S., its prestige or power.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> <b>off</b> Jedidiah Morse {{and contributing}} to her annuity, Shaw also arranged for Hannah Adams to use the library at the Boston Athenæum for her research.|$|R
50|$|Somewhere in {{the area}} is hidden a pair of Gatling guns, which would be vital <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> <b>off</b> such an assault. The only person who knows the hiding place is Dakota Lil, a saloonkeeper who already has lost her husband and son in battle and wants no more part of it.|$|R
50|$|In {{places where}} fewer bodies are offered, the {{vultures}} are more eager- and sometimes have <b>to</b> be <b>fended</b> <b>off</b> with sticks {{during the initial}} preparations.|$|R
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> the Huns, Theodosius {{had to pay}} an {{enormous}} annual tribute to Attila. His successor, Marcian, refused to continue to pay the tribute, but Attila had already diverted {{his attention to the}} West. After Attila's death in 453, the Hunnic Empire collapsed, and many of the remaining Huns were often hired as mercenaries by Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} armament of very light guns designed <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> enemy torpedo boats. The calibre {{and weight of}} secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E

50|$|In early June 2017, Bunge hired {{advisers}} <b>to</b> help it <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> takeover {{interest from}} Glencore in Switzerland.|$|R
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who {{had entered the}} race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a considerable organizational and monetary advantage, and he had already secured influential endorsements. <b>To</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and charisma on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally conservative than Sarbanes, since both candidates were seen as liberal.|$|E
5|$|Mac Lochlainn was slain in 1166, leaving Mac Murchada <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> his own enemies alone. Other than Mac Murchada himself, {{another man}} making {{a bid for}} the high-kingship was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1198). Within {{the same year as}} Mac Lochlainn's demise, Ua Conchobair and his allies expulsed Mac Murchada from not only Dublin, but Ireland altogether; and Ua Conchobair himself was duly {{recognised}} as High King of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Although Timoshenko's forces {{successfully}} regrouped on 21 May, {{he ordered}} a withdrawal of Army Group Kotenko {{by the end of}} 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
30|$|Any heteroglossic {{utterance}} can {{be treated}} as either contracting or expanding the dialogic space. If it contracts the space, the utterance ‘acts <b>to</b> challenge, <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> or restrict’ (Martin and White [2005]: 102) other alternative positions and voices.|$|R
50|$|Freire began {{training}} Brazilian jiu-jitsu {{at the age}} of ten <b>to</b> help <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> {{the stigma}} of his size. As a teenager, he trained at the famed Chute Boxe academy alongside notable MMA stars such as Wanderlei Silva and Mauricio Rua.|$|R
25|$|Biloxi {{spent the}} next three weeks {{conducting}} shore bombardment missions, including closing to within 3,000 yards of the beach and using 40mm guns to support UDT operations. Starting on 1 April, she fired on enemy targets north of the main amphibious landings and then continued these bombardment missions in support of advancing troops ashore. During these weeks, the task group was repeatedly attacked by kamikazes, one of whom just missed Biloxi on 3 April. In addition <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> <b>off</b> these aerial attacks, the light cruiser also fired on enemy suicide boat concentrations.|$|R
5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, they are able <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, {{all of which are}} {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
50|$|Zopyron was a Macedonian general sent by Alexander the Great to deal the Black Sea region. In 331 he {{attacked}} Olbia, {{but the city}} was able <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> him <b>off</b> after freeing its slaves and granting citizenship to resident foreigners.|$|R
50|$|Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I {{employed}} the Pechenegs <b>to</b> help <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> the Magyars. The Pechenegs were {{so successful that}} they drove out the Magyars remaining in Etelköz and the Pontic steppes, forcing them westward towards the Pannonian plain, where they later founded the Hungarian state.|$|R
5000|$|Froth Moth- A Froth Moth is {{a fictional}} species of moth that feeds on teddy bear stuffing. As a result, Froth Moths {{are the most}} feared {{creature}} in the teddy world. They don't like lavender, which teddy bears use <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> them <b>off.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Citadel, {{located on}} the Avenue Pierre Coubertin, was built between 1560 and 1571 {{on the site of}} a former medieval castle which was built in 1229 by Philippe de Hureprel. Its purpose of its {{construction}} was <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> would-be invaders, but it wasn't long until the city was successfully invaded by Archduke Albert of Austria on 24 April 1596. Both Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu at one time considered expanding the citadel and Calais into a great walled city for military harbour purposes but the proposals came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, in April and May 1521, five Portuguese ships docked at Tuen Mun {{to begin}} trading, but {{were ordered to}} leave once {{officials}} came to the region to announce the emperor's death. The Portuguese refused this demand, so the Chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out, sinking one ship, killing many, and taking the rest as prisoners (First Battle of Tamao). Two more Portuguese vessels arrived in June, were attacked by Chinese ships, but were able <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> the Chinese attack. Three more Portuguese ships barely fended off another attack in September, the same month that Fernão Pires de Andrade and Tomé Pires arrived back at Canton. Ming authorities would not permit Fernão and Pires to see the prisoners captured in the sea battles and made inventories of their goods and the goods captured from the Portuguese ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{during the}} War of the First Coalition, Ernouf {{was sent to}} Cassel to {{strengthen}} the French position. The Duke of York laid siege to Dunkirk and blockaded the town of Bergues, on the Belgian border, which had insufficient garrison <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> the British. Ernouf assembled a force of a thousand men and joined Jean Nicolas Houchard; together they marched to the relief of Dunkirk. Once there, he led a column in attack on the British camp. On 5 complémentaire an I (21September 1793), {{which would have been}} {{the last day of the}} first year of the new Republic, he was raised to the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed on 9 vendémiaire an II (30September 1793) as chief of staff to the Army of the North.|$|E
60|$|The House was {{certainly}} all mouth for the moment, but, as I could feel, quite in earnest. A Minister {{with a piece}} of typewritten paper seemed <b>to</b> be <b>fending</b> <b>off</b> volleys of insults. He reminded me somehow of a nervous huntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds.|$|R
30|$|BRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) {{was founded}} in Bangladesh, just after her {{independence}} in 1971 by (knighted) Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, who, like most antagonists of success stories, started off the project with very humble means. The 1971 war had {{an important role in}} starting national development processes (Chowdhury et al. 2013) which led a few individuals to work for BRAC rehabilitation projects in the remote north-eastern parts of Bangladesh. Later on, the founding operators of BRAC shifted their sights from a short-term relief effort to a long-term, more withstanding existence dedicated <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> <b>off</b> the persistent nature of endemic poverty in the country (Chowdhury and Bhuiya 2004).|$|R
50|$|At {{various times}} Vainakh {{came under the}} rule of the Sarmatian-speaking Alans to their west and Khazars to their north, in both cases as vassals or as allies {{depending}} on time period. In times of complete independence, they nonetheless tried to have strong bonds of friendship with these countries both for trade and military purposes. The Vainakh also forged strong links with Georgia for mutual protection as well as trade, and these were initially {{in the context of the}} threat of an Arab invasion (as happened to Caucasian Albania) in the 8th century. The contribution of the Vainakh <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> <b>off</b> Arab designs on the Caucasus was critical.|$|R
5|$|In January 1861, Tom, Horatio and a {{party of}} {{employees}} and their families travelled by steamer to Brisbane, disembarked in Moreton Bay, and then, with livestock and supplies, set out on an eight-month trek through Queensland's rugged interior. Food was scarce and Tom hunted native game <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> starvation. They suffered many other hardships and even death when, in Toowoomba, one of Horatio's men drowned. On the Darling Downs over 10,000 sheep were collected. The size of the Wills party {{attracted the attention of}} local Aborigines, and the two groups engaged in games of mimicry. Wary of entering the region's frontier war, Horatio maintained a conciliatory attitude to the Aborigines. The party reached Cullin-la-ringo, situated on Kairi Aboriginal land, in early October, and proceeded to set up camp.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, he {{returned}} to Raw in a segment which saw him diss Big Show, Lana and Rusev before getting into an altercation with WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day. At WrestleMania 32, The Rock announced that WWE had broken the all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock defeated Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan in an impromptu match, giving him a Rock Bottom and pinning him in six seconds, which set {{the record for the}} fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by the returning John Cena <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> the remaining members of The Wyatt Family, Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman. The Rock was announced as the executive soundtrack producer as well as the playable character for the WWE 2K18 video game on August 17, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the final, Jastremski {{attacked}} {{from the}} outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had enough energy <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> Prokopenko in the late stages to win {{the gold medal in}} a new world record time of 2min 27.8s, a margin of 0.4s, with Jastremski a further 1.4s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win.|$|E
50|$|On {{her first}} day as a {{qualified}} nurse, Maria was attacked by a psychotic patient and had to stab him {{with a pair of}} scissors <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> him <b>off.</b> She had to take two weeks' compassionate leave. Shortly after her return, Maria was promoted to Staff Nurse.|$|R
25|$|It is {{revealed}} in the series S.H.I.E.L.D. that Apocalypse {{at some point in}} the days of Ancient Egypt joined forces with the Brotherhood of the Shield <b>to</b> successfully <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> a Brood invasion. Also present were Imhotep and a man who was either the moon god called Khonshu or his first Moon Knight avatar/champion.|$|R
5000|$|This breed has a {{calm and}} {{reserved}} reaction to threats, and is notably curious and intelligent. An important attribute {{is its ability}} to work as a mixed pack with intact males and females; of course, younger males have to socialize to [...] "temper their dominance" [...] and adapt to working within the pack. They have a natural predisposition toward digging under fences and [...] "expanding their territory," [...] which needs to be monitored and controlled. [...] They are high energy [...] fit, active, vigorous defenders of the flock, and well adapted <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> <b>off</b> wild boar, foxes, and wolves, which are the prevalent predators in the area.
