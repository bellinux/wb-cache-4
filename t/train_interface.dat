40|$|ABSTRACT: New {{users of}} high-function {{application}} systems can become frustrated and {{confused by the}} errors they make {{in the early stages}} of learning. A <b>training</b> <b>interface</b> for a commercial word processor was designed to make typical and troublesome error states "unreachable," thus eliminating the sources of some new-user learning problems. Creating a training environment from the basic function of the system itself afforded substantially faster learning coupled with better learning achievement and better performance on a comprehension post-test. A control group spent almost a quarter of their time recovering from the error states that the <b>training</b> <b>interface</b> blocked off. We speculate on how this training strategy might be refined, 1. and more generally, on how function should be organized in a user interface. Empirical characterizations of computer novices learning to use application systems paint a dreary picture of side tracks and error tangles from which recovery, or even diagnosis, is difficult (e. g., [6]). In this paper, we show that a "training wheels " interface [...] designed to block typical side tracks and error states [...] can facilitate the learning process for new users. THE TRAINING WHEELS INTERFACE We studied a stand-alone, commercial word processing system and observed new users, people who had never used a computer before, trying to learn the system's 2...|$|R

40|$|Concentrated {{boarding}} {{describes the}} phenomenon when rail passengers congregate {{in certain areas}} of the platform, such as at main entrances and staircases. This influences the distribution of passengers throughout the carriages, which can negatively affect passenger comfort, safety at the platform <b>train</b> <b>interface,</b> efficiency of the rail network, and the reputation of rail travel as a whole. This project aimed to determine whether concentrated boarding occur in rail stations in the UK in order to understand its relevance for future rolling stock and infrastructure design and its associated manufacturing research. Video recording technology was used to observe the movements of passengers in Oxford Station, and data was collected for nine trains. By reviewing the recordings, the number of passengers boarding through each door of the trains was determined, and the boarding distributions {{along the length of the}} platform were plotted. Several reasons for noted trends were offered, and potential solutions proposed. The use of real time information could be invaluable to minimise concentrated boarding, as it would allow passengers to make informed decisions as to where they could board trains to have a better journey experience. These findings indicate the relevance of a human-centred design process, particularly the user research stages in the process of defining priorities for manufacturing and engineering...|$|E

Even with the best search technology, the usefulness of search results depends on the searcher’s ability to use that technology effectively. In an effort to improve this ability, our research investigates the effects of logic <b>training,</b> <b>interface</b> <b>training,</b> and the type of search interface on the search process. In a study with 145 participants, we found that even limited training in basic Boolean logic improved performance with a simple search interface. Surprisingly, for users of an interface that assisted themin forming syntactically correct Boolean queries, performance was negatively affected by logic training and unaffected by <b>interface</b> <b>training.</b> Use of the assisted interface itself, however, resulted in strong improvements in performance over use of the simple interface.

30|$|To {{challenge}} {{the use of}} keystroke dynamics as biometrics, Meng et al. (Meng et al. 2013) proposed a feedback and <b>training</b> <b>interface,</b> called Mimesis.

This imitation attack poses an threat to keystroke dynamics based user authentication. Giuffrida et al.

It {{does not apply to}} users typing passwords/PINs on hardware keyboards/keypads.

40|$|Navigation aids such as bookmarks, target prediction, {{or history}} {{mechanisms}} help users find desired objects in visual workspaces. They work by highlighting objects {{that may be}} important, and they can improve performance in spaces where the territory is not well known. However, by making navigation easier, they may also hinder acquisition of a mental map of the space, reducing navigation performance when the navigation aid is not available. We carried out a study {{to determine the effects}} of three different types of navigation aids on spatial location learning. We found that after training with a navigation aid, there was no reduction in performance when the aid was removed. Even with <b>training</b> <b>interfaces</b> that made the task significantly easier, people learned the locations as well as those who had no aid at all in training. These results suggest that designers can use navigation aids to assist inexperienced users, without compromising the eventual acquisition of a spatial map.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} a {{relatively}} unexplored aspect of designing agents that learn from human training by investigating how the agent’s non-task behavior can elicit human feedback of higher quality and quantity. We use the TAMER framework, which facilitates {{the training of}} agents by human-generated reward signals, i. e., judgements {{of the quality of}} the agent’s actions, as the foundation for our investigation. Then, we propose two new <b>training</b> <b>interfaces</b> to increase active involvement in the training process and thereby improve the agent’s task performance. One provides information on the agent’s uncertainty, the other on its performance. Our results from a 51 -subject user study show that these interfaces can induce the trainers to train longer and give more feedback. The agent’s performance, however, increases only in response to the addition of performanceoriented information, not by sharing uncertainty levels. Subsequent analysis of our results suggests that the organizational maxim about human behavior, “you get what you measure”—i. e., sharing metrics with people causes them to focus on maximizing or minimizing those metrics while deemphasizing other objectives — also applies to the training of agents, providing a powerful guiding principle for humanagent interface design in general...|$|R

For this purpose, an open source software called Gamera {{has been used for}} recognition and classification of the characters in the documents.

By using the Gamera classifier <b>training</b> <b>interface,</b> classifier data was created which reflects the characters in the particular theses. The data can then be used in automatic recognition of ‘new’ characters, by loading it into one of Gamera’s classifiers. The output of Gamera are sets of classified glyphs (i. e. small images of characters), stored in an XML-based format. However, as OCR typically involves translation of images of text into a machine-readable format, a complementary OCR-module was needed. For this purpose, an external Gamera module for page segmentation was modified and used. In addition, a script for control of the OCR-process was created, which initiates the pag...|$|R
40|$|While much of {{the data}} on the web is {{unstructured}} in nature, {{there is also a}} significant amount of embedded structured data, such as product information on e-commerce sites or stock data on financial sites. A large amount of research has focused on the problem of generating wrappers, i. e., software tools that allow easy and robust extraction of structured data from text and HTML sources. In many applications, such as comparison shopping, data has to be extracted from many different sources, making manual coding of a wrapper for each source impractical. On the other hand, fully automatic approaches are often not reliable enough, resulting in low quality of the extracted data. We describe a complete system for semi-automatic wrapper generation that can be trained on different data sources in a simple interactive manner. Our goal is to minimize the amount of user effort for training reliable wrappers through design of a suitable <b>training</b> <b>interface</b> that is implemented based on a powerful underlying extraction language and a set of training and ranking algorithms.

We assessed the number of TM cases performed per surgeon, criteria for patient selection, pedicle preference, contralateral symmetrisation, use of routine preoperative MRI, management of involved margins, and clinical coding. Results. We had an overall response rate of 43 %. The most common skin resection technique utilised was wise pattern followed by vertical scar.
