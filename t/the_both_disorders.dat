40|$|Objective—To {{highlight}} emerging {{evidence for}} clinical and biological links between autism/ Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) and schizophrenia, with {{particular attention to}} childhood onset schizophrenia (COS). Method—Clinical, demographic and brain developmental data from the NIMH (and other) COS studies, and selected family, imaging and genetic data from studies of autism, PDD and schizophrenia were reviewed.

In this context, the overlapping phenomenology of borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder and the differential diagnosis of clinical features will be also reviewed with <b>the</b> literature. <b>Both</b> <b>disorders</b> can show common features in terms of diagnosis and overlap in phenomenological perspective. Coexistence of <b>both</b> <b>disorders</b> is quite frequent. The nature of mood shifts, types of impulsivity and the longitudinal course of the disorders should be considered to differenciate them.

The differentiation of borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder is not easy. A very careful evaluation is required. This differentiation may also be useful in terms of treatment. A greater number of research results are available on the effectiveness of valproate and lamotrigine in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. Findings related to other mood stabilizers are insufficient. In the treatment of borderline personality disorder, there is not any drug approved by the official authorities.
