25|$|Easter Monday 1969 {{saw another}} brainchild of John Webb and the BRSCC's Competitions Director Nick Syreett come to fruition. This was Formula 5000 {{which was based}} upon the American Formula A, the cars being {{single-seater}} chassis powered by American V8 and V6 stock-block engines of up to 5-litre capacity. The need for the new formula {{was caused by the}} escalating costs of Formula Three, Formula Two and <b>the</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> non-championship Formula One events as more and more countries demanded a Grand Prix. The winner of the first Formula 5000 race was Peter Gethin driving a McLaren M10A with Chevrolet power.|$|E

Opinions varied on his motivations, with his supporters sharing his disapproval of the race's lack of status within CART, the increasing number of foreign drivers (as American drivers were gravitating towards NASCAR), and <b>the</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ovals in the season series. Detractors accused George of throwing his weight around and using the race as leverage to gain complete control of the sport of open wheel racing in the United States.|$|E

500|$|The {{population}} in southern China {{has been reduced}} to a few hundred individuals, and by another report, may be locally extinct. [...] <b>The</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pygmy slow lorises for sale corroborates reports of rapid declines in Vietnamese populations. By 2007, field sightings were becoming scarce, and there were reports that it had disappeared from large parts of its range, particularly in areas with intense logging and agriculture. In Cambodia, widespread declines have been associated with increases in hunting pressure during 2001 and 2002. In one field survey, three areas with high encounter rates in early 2008 were resurveyed in late 2008 and 2009, but no individuals were encountered. [...] This change was thought to be due to both high hunting pressures and gold mine development.|$|E
500|$|Following the merger, {{plans were}} drawn up to rebuild Park Hall {{in a project}} {{referred}} to as [...] "Oswald Park". In 2005, TNS started to rebuild Park Hall {{with a view to}} moving there in 2008 because they were unable to improve the Recreation Ground as it was a council-owned recreation ground. Shortly afterwards Total Network Solutions renamed themselves The New Saints as their sponsorship deal lapsed due to the sponsoring company being bought out by British Telecom. During renovation, Park Hall's pitch was replaced with artificial Ligaturf, as used at the home ground of Red Bull Salzburg. As a result of The New Saints moving to Park Hall and <b>the</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the team's players who were from Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain, some supporters broke away from The New Saints to form Llansantffraid Village F.C..|$|E
2500|$|Experts {{attribute}} high {{mortality rates}} and under nutrition amongst infants to <b>the</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> woman who breastfeed. This delay in breastfeeding initiation {{increases the risk}} of neonatal mortality. Experts suggest breastfeeding within the first day of birth until the infant is 6-months old. [...] Promotion of breastfeeding during this period could potentially reduce the mortality rates by 16% if infant was breast fed since day one and 22% if the infant was breastfed within the first hour. Rates of breastfeeding initiation vary with ethnicity and socioeconomic situations. Studies suggest that college educated women over their 30 are more likely to initiate breastfeeding in comparison to other women who have different levels of educational attainment.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{pathogenic}} role of ANCA {{is still}} controversial, in vitro and animal models {{support the idea}} that the antibodies have a direct pathological role in the formation of small vessel vasculitides. MPO and PR3 specific ANCA can activate neutrophils and monocytes through their Fc and Fab'2 receptors, which can be enhanced by cytokines which cause neutrophils to display MPO and PR3 on their surface. Aberrant glycosylation of the MPO and PR3 specific ANCA enhances their ability to interact with activating Fc receptors on neutrophils. [...] The activated neutrophils can then adhere to endothelial cells where degranulation occurs. This releases free oxygen radicals and lytic enzymes, resulting in damage to the endothelium via the induction of necrosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, neutrophils release chemoattractive signalling molecules that recruit more neutrophils to the endothelium, acting as a positive feedback loop. Animal models have shown that MPO antibodies can induce necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and systemic small vessel vasculitis. In these animal models the formation of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis can occur in the absence of T-cells, however neutrophils must be present. Although the direct pathogenic role of ANCA is the most accepted theory to date of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) pathogenesis, the theory still fails to explain the observation that [...] ANCA serum concentration does not always correlate disease activity or relapses, where high ANCA titres can be found in patients, and in some normal individuals, with no sign of vasculitis. In addition, in patients with active disease, treated with Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody which remove circulating B-cells, clinical remission [...] correlates more to <b>the</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> circulating B-cells than decrease in ANCA titre, which in some patient does not change during treatment. The same study found that clinical relapse in some patients were in association with the return of circulating B-cells. Based on the above observations and that ANCA reactive B-cells can be found in circulation in patients with AAV, an alternative hypothesis have been proposed assigning [...] a direct pathogenic role of these cells, whereby activated neutrophils and ANCA-reactive B-cells engage in intercellular cross-talk, which leads not only to neutrophil degranulation and inflammation but also to the proliferation and differentiation of ANCA-reactive B-cells. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested.|$|E
60|$|The {{lower and}} naked {{part of the}} sub-peduncle (C) is {{likewise}} slightly sensitive to a rub, and I have seen it bent round a stick and even partly round a leaf with which it had come into contact. That the sub-peduncle has the same nature as the corresponding branch of an ordinary tendril, is well shown when it bears only a few flowers; for {{in this case it}} becomes less branched, increases in length, and gains both in sensitiveness and in the power of spontaneous movement. I have twice seen sub-peduncles which bore from thirty to forty flower- buds, and which had become considerably elongated and were completely wound round sticks, exactly like true tendrils. The whole length of another sub-peduncle, bearing only eleven flower-buds, quickly became curved when slightly rubbed; but even this scanty number of flowers rendered the stalk less sensitive than the other branch, that is, the flower-tendril; for the latter after a lighter rub became curved more quickly and in a greater degree. I have seen a sub-peduncle thickly covered with flower-buds, with one of its higher lateral branchlets bearing from some cause only two buds; and this one branchlet had become much elongated and had spontaneously caught hold of an adjoining twig; in fact, it formed a little sub-tendril. The increasing length of the sub-peduncle (C) with <b>the</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the flower-buds is a good instance of the law of compensation. In accordance with this same principle, the true tendril as a whole is always longer than the flower-stalk; for instance, on the same plant, the longest flower-stalk (measured {{from the base of the}} common peduncle to the tip of the flower-tendril) was 8.5 inches in length, whilst the longest tendril was nearly double this length, namely 16 inches.|$|E

30|$|The core {{finding of}} misfits between {{information}} processing requirements and capacities {{may not be}} the most interesting finding in this study. The reduced number of employees (and their competence level) on weekend duty may be an expected finding as it is one of the often-mentioned suggestions in previous literature as to the existence of the weekend effect. However, the analysis also shows that it is not only <b>the</b> people component, i.e., <b>decreased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> employees and competence levels, which changes, other components in the organizational design of the emergency department change too (Burton et al. 2015), which existing literature has not pointed out. For example, my analysis shows that the emergency department has a less effective set of coordination and control mechanisms, which is yet another component of the organizational design. Some of this is due the department's delegation of tasks among the employees on weekend duty, e.g., the emergency physician on duty could have headed the morning conference on weekends but this task was filled by a medical department consultant. Another part is due to <b>the</b> <b>decreased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> emergency physicians, e.g., <b>the</b> <b>decreased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> self-contained subunits. Thus, when the people element changes, a ripple effect is created, and other elements of the organizational design, including the coordination and control element, change too. This means that even minor understaffing may lead to substantial misfits and lower performance in the organization.|$|R
