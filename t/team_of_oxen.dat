25|$|Not all {{arable land}} in Greece was yet under {{cultivation}} in the Archaic period. Farms {{appear to have}} been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster. Crop rotation was practiced, alternating between legumes and cereals (barley and durum), and the land was left fallow every other year. Alongside these, farmers cultivated vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables as cash crops for sale in local centres and abroad. Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth. A <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain. Horses and large herds of cattle were the preserve of the mega-rich.|$|E

On the campaign's successful conclusion, William gave his kinsman Roger de Poictou all of the land between the River Mersey and the River Ribble. Part of this land was in turn given to Albert de Greslet, who {{towards the end of}} the 12th century, bestowed as much land as a <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> could plough in one-year on Orme Fitz Seward, the son of Edward Aylward.

2500|$|These debts stemmed {{mostly from}} {{investments}} in canals. [...] A {{man and his}} <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> hired at two dollars per day. [...] The population of the province was estimated at 400,000, while the debt of the province amounted to around 1,000,000 pounds. [...] The annual revenues amounted to 60,000, a sum almost insufficient to pay the interest on the debt. [...] The dissolution of the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada in spring of 1836 resulted from the denial of money bills by the Reformist Legislative Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} Farm Towns {{lies in the}} common medieval {{sub-division}} of land called a ploughgate (104 acres), the extent of land which one plough <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> could till in a year. This area was again subdivided into four husbandlands, each of [...] Each husbandland could provide two oxen and eight oxen were need for a plough-team. This arrangement led to small farm towns like Hessilhead being established with accommodation {{for at least four}} men in six to eight houses, taking practical considerations into account. A similar 'ferm toun' existed at Bloak, near Auchentiber, until the 1890s.|$|E
2500|$|Washington kept a daily journalfrom 1832-1876 which {{provides}} a few glimpses into life on the farm. He owned approximately 300 sheep, often bought and sold cattle and horses, and owned a <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> and mules. He tells of chopping ice from the river in January 1868 and storing it in the icehouse. The bottom land behind the house, which totaled over , was planted in hay and corn. The field {{in front of the}} house was called [...] "the little meadow." [...] Corn was grown [...] in the bottom land, and timothy-grass [...] grown and harvested in the meadow.|$|E

So now I had to turn my mind upon how I was to get out of my barrel. I had thought of several ways, and was balancing one against the other when the question was decided for me in a very simple but unexpected manner.|$|E

A child was toddling about the floor and another, a very little girl, lay with a flushed face in a canvas chair. The woman asked Alison no questions, but set about getting supper ready, and after a while Thorne, who had apparently been putting up the team, came in. As he did so the child in the chair held out her hands to him.|$|E

They go on from a quarter-section and a <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> to the biggest farm they can handle, and every fresh furrow they cut enriches all of us. The other kind want to sit down in the dirt and take life easily, as they've always done. The dirt worries {{everybody}} else, and we've no use for them.

5000|$|The mines {{were also}} used by the U.S. during the Battle of Khe Sanh; however, a U.S. Air Force history {{described}} them as being [...] "little more than a nuisance," [...] due to the Viet Cong clearing the gravel mine fields by using <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> that dragged logs over them and to the mines themselves becoming inert after a short time.|$|R
60|$|It was a frank offer; we {{accepted}} it as frankly, and lived like three brothers while the prairie lay white and silent {{month after month}} under the Arctic frost. Also we found that a young Englishman who lived twenty {{miles to the west}} was anxious to dispose of his homestead and one hundred and sixty acres of partly broken land at a bargain. We rode over to make inquiries, and learned that he had lost several successive crops. Jasper, however, said this was because {{he spent most of his}} time in shooting, while the man who wished to succeed in that region must start his work in grim earnest and stay right with it. Now he was going out to a berth in India, and would take the equivalent of four hundred pounds sterling for the buildings and land, with the implements and a <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen</b> thrown in--at least one hundred and fifty pounds down, and the rest to run at eight per cent. on mortgage. It was dirt cheap at the money, but there was no one to buy it, he said, and Jasper, who acted as our adviser, agreed with this.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a lovely}} day, a lovely, lovely day of early autumn. Over the great plain of Lombardy a {{magnificent}} blue sky glowed like mid-summer, the sun shone strong. The great plain, with its great stripes of cultivation--without hedges or boundaries---how beautiful it was! Sometimes he saw oxen ploughing. Sometimes. Oh, so beautiful, teams of eight, or ten, even of twelve pale, great soft oxen in procession, ploughing the dark velvety earth, a driver with a great whip at their head, a man far behind holding the plough-shafts. Beautiful the soft, soft plunging motion of oxen moving forwards. Beautiful the strange, snaky lifting of the muzzles, the swaying of the sharp horns. And the soft, soft crawling motion of a <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxen,</b> so invisible, almost, yet so inevitable. Now and again straight canals of water flashed blue. Now and again the great lines of grey-silvery poplars rose and made avenues or lovely grey airy quadrangles across the plain. Their top boughs were spangled with gold and green leaf. Sometimes the vine-leaves were gold and red, a patterning. And the great square farm-homesteads, white, red-roofed, with their out-buildings, stood naked amid the lands, without screen or softening. There was something big and exposed about it all. No more the cosy English ambushed life, no longer the cosy littleness of the landscape. A bigness--and nothing to shelter the unshrinking spirit. It was all exposed, exposed to the sweep of plain, to the high, strong sky, and to human gaze. A kind of boldness, an indifference. Aaron was impressed and fascinated. He looked with new interest at the Italians in the carriage with him--for this same boldness and indifference and exposed gesture. And he found it in them, too. And again it fascinated him. It seemed so much bigger, as if the walls of life had fallen. Nay, the walls of English life will have to fall.|$|E
