50|$|Williams {{began on}} guitar at age 12. He played in rock bands in high school, and studied with blues {{musician}} Johnny Shines {{from the late}} 1960s until 1971. Early in the 1970s Williams played in the University of Alabama B Jazz Ensemble and the Salt & Pepper Soul Band. He also started working with LaDonna Smith around this time, and founded a musical ensemble/recording project called Transmuseq. He toured the U.S. and Europe in 1978. Early in the 1980s he worked in a blues band called <b>Trains</b> <b>in</b> <b>Trouble,</b> then joined Curlew in 1986, who released several albums on Cuneiform Records through the 1990s.|$|R

50|$|Even at this stage, {{there were}} still two more {{opportunities}} to get the train to stop. Driver Saulin messaged a warning and activated an emergency alarm to signal that his <b>train</b> was <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> but he identified neither himself nor his position to the controllers. The controllers knew that the runaway train {{was one of four}} trains due to arrive at the station and they messaged all of them to narrow the possibilities down. However, when Saulin pushed the emergency alarm, it forced all trains on the network to stop wherever they were and wait for instructions. Several other drivers communicated with the controller for an explanation for the stoppage. The station staff tried to divert the train to an empty track, but the men were unable to identify which <b>train</b> was <b>in</b> distress because Saulin failed to identify himself and his position. Since he had left his cab, he could not have responded to the controller's communication to find out which <b>train</b> was <b>in</b> distress. Then the controllers tried to message all four inbound trains to eliminate the three problem-free ones, but since Saulin had hit the alarm button, a stream of calls from many trains inquiring about the stoppage clogged communication links between the controllers and other trains. Because the many messages kept the controllers busy, the controllers were never able to identify the troubled train.|$|R

25|$|Kotoōshū managed {{only three}} double-figure scores in 2006, and {{none at all}} in 2007, only doing enough to {{maintain}} his rank. Shortly before the November 2007 tournament he dislocated his right knee <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> Clearly <b>troubled</b> by the injury he pulled out on the 7th day, {{the first time in}} his career that he has had to withdraw from a tournament. He preserved his ōzeki rank with a 9–6 score in January 2008. In the Osaka tournament of March 2008 he injured his left arm in a match with Kakuryū on the 4th day and withdrew on Day 9 with only two wins. There was speculation that he would be demoted to sekiwake in the following tournament in May.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} what injuries {{are most likely}} to occur due to classical ballet practice. The research used national and international bibliography. The bibliography analysis indicated that technical and esthetical demands lead to a practice of non-anatomical movements, causing the ballet dancer to suffer from a number of associated lesions. Most of the injuries are caused by technical mistakes and wrong <b>training.</b> <b>Troubles</b> <b>in</b> children are usually due to trying to force external rotation at hip level and to undue use of point ballet slippers. The commonest lesions are in feet and ankles, followed by knees and hips. The rarest ones are in the upper limbs. These injuries are caused by exercise excess, by repetitions always in the same side and by wrong and early use of point slippers. The study reached the conclusion that incorrect application of classical ballet technique predisposes the dancers to characteristic injuries...|$|R
