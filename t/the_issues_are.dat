25|$|The {{question}} is, how can {{the differences}} between social wasp mimics and bumblebee mimics be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, {{they are less likely}} to be polymorphic. Their mimics are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their mimics match them more exactly and are polymorphic also. <b>The</b> <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> currently being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the first}} report that carbon {{monoxide}} is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, {{as well as one}} of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators, and encouragers of neovascular growth. However, <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from wet macular degeneration, a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.|$|E

25|$|Sembène drew on many {{of these}} {{experiences}} for his French-language first novel, Le Docker Noir (The Black Docker, 1956), the story of Diaw, an African stevedore who faces racism and mistreatment on the docks at Marseille. Diaw writes a novel, which is later stolen by a white woman and published under her name; he confronts her, accidentally kills her, and is tried and executed in scenes highly reminiscent of Albert Camus's The Stranger (also translated as The Outsider). Though the book focuses particularly on the mistreatment of African immigrants, Sembène also details the oppression of Arab and Spanish workers, {{making it clear that}} <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> as much economic as they are racial. Like most of his fiction, it is written in a social realist mode. Many critics today consider the book somewhat flawed; however, it began Sembène's literary reputation and provided him with the financial support to continue writing.|$|E
25|$|George Washington {{remains the}} central figure found on U.S. postage. The first {{president}} appears {{on the face of}} U.S. postage more than any other president. The engraved images of Washington found on the early issues set the precedent that all U.S. postage issues would follow in the following decades. Indeed, in virtually every U.S. definitive stamp series offered between 1851 and 1932, Washington appeared on the normal letter-rate value (the only exception being the short-lived 1869 pictorial issue); other presidents, statesmen and famous Americans were confined to the less commonly used denominations. Since the first U.S. postage stamp was issued by the U.S. Post Office, there have been more examples of George Washington appearing on U.S. postage than all other American presidents combined, including Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and even the frequently honored Benjamin Franklin (who was not president). Examples of all the various Washington stamps are too numerous to include in this section, as many of <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> very similar with only differences in color and denomination, such as the Washington-Franklin issues. Featured below are the issues that are unique in their designs and the most definitive.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} usages of ethanol which include an {{additive}} to gasoline, a primary ingredient for food preservation {{as well as}} alcoholic beverages and being used for transdermal drug delivery. For example, it can function as an antiseptic in topical creams to kill bacteria by denaturing proteins. Ethanol is an amphiphilic molecule meaning that it has chemical and physical properties associated with hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. Although, studies show that when penetrating through the biomembrane its hydrophobic abilities appear to be limited based on its preference to bind closely to the hydrophilic region of the phospholipids. There are various issues presented in regards to ethanol's ability to penetrate through the biomembrane and cause a reorganization of the phospholipids towards non-lamellar phases. <b>The</b> <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> as followed: 1) how the alteration of the phospholipids' phase occurs 2) understanding the significance of ethanol's interaction with membrane proteins and membrane phospholipids 3) understanding the permeability of the biomembrane based on the tolerance and adaptation level {{in the presence of}} ethanol although this process appears to be concentration dependent 4) determining the significance of ethanol's amphiphilic character as it relates to its ability to partition throughout the membrane by increasing the fluidity of it. Ethanol's hydrophobic properties are limited and primarily binds close the hydrophilic region of the phospholipid. This bonds creates a strong hydrogen bonds and leads to a strong interlocking amongst the acyl chains 5) why the presence of cholesterol; a sterol compound, inhibits ethanol's ability to disrupt the membrane and 6) deriving the molecular level mechanism of the entire process.|$|E

25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. <b>The</b> <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E

2500|$|Cladistics {{embraces the}} concept of the [...] "most recent common ancestor", and {{assigning}} similar animals to groups called clades.
