5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar {{was forced to}} cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, {{and the next day}} at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
25|$|The walkout tied {{up about}} ninety {{ships in the}} Port of Los Angeles. Police quickly started to round up known IWW agitators, thus {{depleting}} the ranks of strike leaders and permitting some ships <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> Twelve vessels in the offshore trade, manned by seamen sympathetic to the IWW, suffered the longest delays. The thirty-seven lumber schooners in port were largely manned by non-unionists or members of the Sailors Union. Nevertheless, the cargoes {{of a number of}} them had to be discharged in rotation at the piers by the ships' officers because of the shortage of dockhands.|$|E
25|$|While Burnside's {{agents were}} {{purchasing}} the gunboats {{they were also}} buying or leasing other vessels {{to be used as}} transports. The soldiers and transports for the expedition assembled at Annapolis. Embarkation began on January 5, 1862, and on January 9 they began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> with orders to rendezvous at Fort Monroe, near the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. There they met the naval contingent, and on January 11 they set sail. Until this time, only Burnside and his immediate staff knew their ultimate destination. Once at sea, the captain of each ship opened his sealed orders and learned that his ship should proceed to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
50|$|As of 2007, {{pre-production}} {{work had}} been completed on Nam Prix, with Five Star Production awaiting Besson's EuropaCorp to provide its 50% of the budget needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> filming <b>under</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] I cried. [...] "Each {{has done}} his duty, and now, Kantos Kan, may we not repair at once <b>to</b> Hastor and <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> before to-morrow's sun?" ...|$|R
60|$|I made {{no answer}} to this hospitable communication; and, indeed, he didn't wait for any, bolting away on to his bridge <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his ship <b>under</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
500|$|Under the moniker of [...] "The Plastic U.F.Ono Band", Lennon {{engaged the}} {{services}} of session drummer Jim Keltner, guitarist David Spinozza, Gordon Edwards on bass, Arthur Jenkins on percussion, Michael Brecker on saxophone, Ken Ascher on piano and organ, and the vocal backing {{of a group called}} Something Different. Difficulties between Lennon and Ono became more and more noticeable around this time. Just as the sessions were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> in June at New York's Record Plant Studios, John and Yoko separated. At Ono's urging, Pang became Lennon's companion and lover in what would become an 18-month relationship later renowned as Lennon's [...] "lost weekend".|$|E
500|$|Smith, aged 13 at the time, {{signed a}} record-breaking multi-album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz in December 2008, {{six months after}} {{finishing}} outside the top three in the Britain's Got Talent series two final. Her debut album, Faryl, was released in March 2009. Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label. I'm really happy that they want me to do another album so soon – I didn't think I would be working on one so quickly after the first one was released ... I'm just excited <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A second {{aerial attack}} at 15:09 {{surprised}} the Italians; Lieutenant-Commander Dalyell-Stead {{was able to}} fly his Albacore to within [...] of Vittorio Veneto before releasing a torpedo which hit her outer port propeller and caused [...] of flooding. Dalyell-Stead and his crew were killed when their aircraft was shot down by antiaircraft fire from the battleship. The ship stopped while the damage was repaired, but she was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> again at 16:42, making [...] Cunningham heard of the damage to Vittorio Veneto, and started a pursuit.|$|E
60|$|The head-yards were {{accordingly}} braced aback in {{the proper}} direction, {{and it was then}} reported to the captain that all was ready <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ship <b>under</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R

60|$|Then, {{without waiting}} for permission, Darius began giving us fool orders {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the pungy <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> and we came lumbering around under the ship's starboard, where {{we could have been}} blown into the next world with no more labor than the lighting of a match.|$|R
2500|$|While in the Mindanao Sea, on 21 February 1945, Renshaw {{was struck}} by a torpedo from an enemy submarine, about 10 feet (3 m) below the waterline, {{flooding}} the firerooms. The ship lost all power, a large section of the hull was warped by the explosion, and bulkheads and decks were fractured. Even though 19 men were killed and 20 injured, within a matter of minutes, damage control parties had the flooding reduced by half. Through their efforts the main propulsion machinery suffered no damage. She managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> again, and was escorted to San Pedro Bay by [...]|$|E
2500|$|First Sergeant William L. Umbles was demoted on that day. The exact {{reasons are}} uncertain. Some said Nolan was displeased with him. It {{might have been}} that Umbles tried to {{convince}} Nolan to turn back. It {{may have been the}} last straw in Nolan's trust in the First Sergeant after the alcohol incident. The two men would be silent on the exact reason later. But many agreed Umbles was angry and his behavior would show [...] during [...] "The Thirsting Time" [...] to come. The buffalo hunters came back to camp excited at finding a large trail of sign and Tafoya estimated 40 Comanche in the band near Rich Lake. Boots and saddles were called and the men made haste <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> Nolan had not immediately appointed another acting First Sergeant and in his excitement to be underway failed {{to make sure that all}} canteens were full. Normally, this is the First Sergeants duty, but it always is the responsibility of the commander to make sure things like this get done. [...] "The Thirsting Time" [...] had begun.|$|E
60|$|The {{transports}} were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> {{immediately and}} move slowly south. The fleet of battleships would overtake {{them on the}} morning of the second day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Sir Jarvy, I understands. We {{are about}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ships <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> and good men {{ought to be}} in their places. Good-by, Admiral Blue. We shall meet before the face of the French, and then I expects every man on us will set an example to himself of courage and devotion." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1938 Guy Motors built five Guy Quad {{armoured}} car prototypes to a design by the Woolwich Arsenal {{based on the}} Quad-Ant artillery tractor chassis. In early 1938 {{a number of different}} 4x4 chassis from British and foreign manufacturers had been tested to see which was the best for development of a new line of {{armoured car}}s to replace those older designs in use. By September three armoured cars had been built by Guy. While chassis with more advanced features were seen as having better potential it was decided that in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> production <b>under</b> <b>way</b> the Guy chassis was preferred.|$|R
60|$|But {{notwithstanding}} Mr. George's {{determination that}} he would not travel in company with such a lady, it seemed to be decreed that he should do so, for he left London about a week after this to go to Holland with Rollo alone; and though he postponed setting out for several days, so as to allow Mr. and Mrs. Parkman time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> well <b>under</b> <b>way</b> before them, he happened to fall in with them several times {{in the course of the}} journey. The first time that he met with them was in crossing the Straits of Dover.|$|R
60|$|One by one {{the crew}} {{returned}} to the steamer, but the schooner’s deck {{showed no signs of}} life. Then the skipper came, and, having peered critically over his vessel’s side, gave orders <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guessed that}} {{something}} of the kind {{might be in the}} wind when the word was given <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> It would have pleased me better, Amos, if you had been detailed to go with the advance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you must}} get well {{as soon as you}} can," [...] Miss Haverley said. [...] "You know we shall leave in half an hour for the yacht, so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> in time for the start." ...|$|E
6000|$|The veriest {{landsman}} {{who ever}} lived would have understood that it was folly <b>to</b> think of <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> just then, and my heart grew heavy as lead in my breast, for I firmly believed that before another hour had passed the enemy would be out searching for the prisoners who had escaped, in which case all hands of us stood {{a good chance of}} seeing the interior of that [...] "stone house." ...|$|R
50|$|A rapid {{succession}} of prototypes {{would be built}} to finalize the car. The cars at Le Castellet were numbers 8 and 9. Numbers 10 and 11 were built for crash-testing and numbers 12, 13 and 14 came after. Prototype 14 was basically pre-production and would eventually {{be one of the}} cars Tastevin kept for his personal use. Tastevin had hired a director <b>to</b> <b>get</b> production <b>under</b> <b>way</b> at Balbigny, but nothing was built for a year while the new director stalled and made changes to the car. Eventually Tastevin fired the directory and turned production over to LawrenceTune again while he looked for a new director. The car was also subsequently shown at the Earls Court auto show.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, John, still {{fearful of}} {{becoming}} attached to someone, instructs Paul <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ship <b>under</b> <b>way</b> immediately. Two days later, {{he has a}} change of heart and steers the Yankee back into the inlet. He meets Millie again and they say that they love with each other. After explaining that she is afraid of Nicholas, John convinces her to go to the wharf with her grandfather at eight o'clock that night.|$|R
6000|$|But I had no leisure {{to weigh}} {{the merits of the}} matter--footsteps in the saloon, a heavy knock. [...] "There's enough wind <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> with, sir." [...] Here was the call of a new claim upon my {{thoughts}} and even upon my feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} we will do; an' it'll save heavin' up the heavy anchor!" [...] Joe cried. [...] "The Bonita can lay {{alongside}} as well {{as if she was}} moored, and it won't take us so long <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> when the wind does come." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was raining}} when we awoke Monday morning, {{but we were}} now restless <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> We {{could not afford to}} spend another day waiting in the rain. It was gloomy {{business}} in camp, and {{at the first sign of}} lightening sky we packed up and started promptly at twelve o'clock.|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} noon when the Dawn anchored; {{and the wind}} got more to the eastward, {{about half an hour}} afterwards. It was out of the {{question}} <b>to</b> think of <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> again, with so strong a wind, and with our feeble crew. Had it been perfectly smooth water, and had there been neither tide, nor air, it would have taken us half a day, at least, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out two bowers. It was folly, therefore, to think of it, situated as we were. It only remained, to ride out the gale in the best manner we could.|$|R
50|$|As {{the home}} effort of World War II gained momentum, the NYA's crucial role quickly dwindled. The booming munitions and war {{industry}} economy was recruiting {{large numbers of}} workers, and the agency was no longer vital for ensuring work opportunity and growth among the population. This was specifically true for lesser-skilled workers who previously needed a support network to secure work or the skills needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their careers <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> While the NYA was shut down in 1943, the agency's legacy lives on in its imprint on society and future generations.|$|R
60|$|We are all {{sorry that}} you are not coming until the middle of next month, but we hope that you will then be able to remain, so that we may all come back {{together}} about the 10th of October. I think (recreation allowed, etc.), that the play will take that time to write. The ladies of the dram. pers. are frightfully anxious <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>to</b> see you locked up in the pavilion; apropos of which noble edifice I have omitted to mention that it is made a more secluded retreat than it used to be, and is greatly improved by the position of the door being changed. It is as snug and as pleasant as possible; and the Genius of Order has made a few little improvements about the house (at the rate of about tenpence apiece), which the Genius of Disorder will, it is hoped, appreciate.|$|R
60|$|So anxious was Tarzan {{to rescue}} the child that he gave not the {{slightest}} thought to the strangeness of all the conditions surrounding the Kincaid. That her deck was deserted, though she had steam up, and from the volume of smoke pouring from her funnel was all ready <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> made no impression upon him.|$|E
60|$|Lying {{within the}} shade of the trees, and so far up river that we could neither see nor hear the swarm of {{soldiers}} which had lighted upon Benedict, we took things easy for a couple of hours, keeping sharp watch, however, to make certain that no craft passed us, and then Darius gave the word <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It will {{be quite}} time enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> late in the afternoon, and then under short canvas. Ten hours will be ample time for this ship to beat up to that passage in, {{and it will be}} {{imprudent}} to arrive too soon; nor do I suppose you will wish to be playing round the reef in the dark." ...|$|E
60|$|But Prince Ludwig was one who {{believed}} in being forehanded and so it happened that the orders for the mobilization of the army of Lutha were issued within fifteen minutes of his return to Lustadt. It would do no harm, thought the old man, with a grim smile, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things well <b>under</b> <b>way</b> a day ahead of time. This accomplished, he summoned the Serbian minister, with what purpose and to what effect became historically evident several days later. When, after twenty-four hours' absence, his aide had not returned from Blentz, the chancellor had no regrets for his forehandedness.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} to take me away in the plane," [...] the girl called back. [...] "He {{is going to}} take me farther inland to another country where he says that he will be king and I am to be one of his wives," [...] and then to the Englishman's {{surprise}} she turned a smiling face toward him, [...] "but there is no danger," [...] she continued, [...] "for we shall both be dead within a few minutes--just give him time enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the machine <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> and if he can rise a hundred feet from the ground I shall never need fear him more." ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{received}} the fugitives personally, had helped some over the rail; in the darkness, slashed about by lightning, he had guessed that {{not one of them}} was unwounded, {{and in the midst of}} tottering shapes he wondered how on earth they had managed to reach the long-boat that had brought them off. He caught unceremoniously in his arms the smallest of these shapes and carried it into the cabin, then without looking at his light burden ran up again on deck <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the brig <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> While shouting out orders he was dimly aware of someone hovering near his elbow. It was Hassim.|$|R
