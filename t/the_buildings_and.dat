The society resolved to secure the new state institution for Romney. On April 12, 1870, the society passed a resolution by which the members agreed to deed, free of cost, <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> grounds of the Romney Classical Institute.|$|E
5|$|By 1844 {{there were}} 60 private patients. The {{building}} was refronted and a chapel added in 1851. The design of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> the therapeutic regime {{were seen as}} models to be followed elsewhere, including at the General Lunatic Asylum of Nottingham at Sneinton, and the drafting of the 1808 County Asylums Act and Lunacy Act 1845.|$|E

5|$|A fire {{destroyed}} part of {{the monastery}} during the War of the Spanish Succession. During the Peninsular War, French troops looted <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> used them as barracks. The monks were forced to leave in 1820 because of confiscations by a new liberal government, but they returned in 1823 after King Ferdinand VII restored conservative institutions. However, the nearby villagers denied support to the monastery despite its protection by the king. The monastery ceased to operate in 1835: the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state; the monastery had only four monks and one lay brother, who were cast out.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{the student}} {{population}} was over 10,000, placing it as the fourth largest California state institution and larger than 96% of the U.S.’s colleges and universities at the time. In 1957, entering freshmen scores on examinations were ranked in the top 10% of all universities in the U.S. In the following years, the college’s scores also surpassed most of the other California state colleges. In 1957 the college became the first to use an identification number for each student, which was necessary to simplify handling of records, grades, and other tasks of the large number of students. To keep up with student expansion, the square footage of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> classrooms was increased from 255,434 to 1,243,737.|$|E

5|$|Four {{military}} units {{were assigned to}} the post. The MP Detachment, 4817th Service Command Unit, arrived from Fort Riley, Kansas, in April 1943. Its initial strength was 7 officers and 196 enlisted men; by December 1946 it had 9 officers and 486 men, and was manning 44 guard posts 24 hours a day. The Provisional Engineer Detachment (PED), 4817th Service Command Unit, was activated at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, on 10 April 1943. These men performed jobs around the post such as working in the boiler plant, the motor pool and the mess halls. They also maintained <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> roads. It reached a peak strength of 465 men, and was disbanded on 1 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Holmes was keenly {{involved}} with {{the details of the}} Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of <b>the</b> <b>buildings,</b> <b>and</b> even the placement of the chairs and tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1967, the {{grandstand}} caught {{fire and the}} entire structure burned down beyond repair. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> stands were subsequently demolished. At the same time, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration proposed that the Fetveien road, which runs {{to the south of}} the stadium, should be moved to run through the stadium, which would have required the stadium to be moved. However, the Public Roads Administration abandoned their plans and a building permit was issued. New changing rooms, club house and terraces were completed in September 1968.|$|E
50|$|The Commissioner of the IRS {{claimed that}} the {{property}} inherited by Crane was <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> land itself, not merely the equity in <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> land. This position had the merit of comporting with the facts at hand: prior to selling the property, Mrs. Crane had been allowed depreciation deductions in excess of $25,000 on <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Correspondingly, <b>the</b> Commissioner argued that Crane, through the sale of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> land, received an amount equal to the net of the cash received {{in addition to the}} amount of debt assumed by the purchaser.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of April 23, 2015, a car rammed through the gates protecting the loading dock {{on the east side}} of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> drove toward <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> then burst into flames approximately halfway between <b>the</b> gates <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Firefighters <b>and</b> a bomb squad were called to the scene.

5|$|Premier of North West Supra Mahumapelo promised {{residents}} {{that all}} who {{were affected by}} the earthquake would receive help. Mahumapelo said that counselling, social relief and temporary accommodation were being provided, and that <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> infrastructure damaged in the earthquake might take years to repair. The North West provincial government started the North West Disaster Relief Fund to help residents affected by the earthquake. Teams were sent to investigate damage to parts of the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality by the municipality. The Cabinet of South Africa sent its condolences {{to the family of}} the man who was killed by the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Rübel {{continued}} {{operating the}} ranch {{in the same}} manner as the Del Valles, employing many of same workers. He had served in the American Field Service during World War I and when World War II broke out, he volunteered for active duty again. He died while serving in Tunisia in 1943. After his death, his widow Mary married a man named Edwin Burger, who was not as interested in maintaining the rancho. After Mary's death in 1968, Burger closed the ranch entirely. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> grounds were left untended for years. Rübel's heirs regained control of the property after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which had damaged a number of buildings on the rancho.|$|E
5|$|Scott Kugle, a Professor of Emory University and a researcher, {{studied the}} life of Mah Laqa Bai. During his study, he came across this {{memorial}} in a dilapidated condition. Kugle proposed the idea of renovating it. In the year 2010, by using funds from the US government through the Consulate General's office in Hyderabad, the Center for Deccan Studies spearheaded the year-long renovation project. The Muslim Educational, Social and Cultural Organization also provided support to the project. In this renovation project, the debris was cleared, water channels were rebuilt, trees, bushes, <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> their exquisite decorations were restored.|$|E

5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several hundred feet. It took workers several days to clean <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The College of All Saints was an ecclesiastical {{college in}} Maidstone, Kent, England, founded in 1395 by Archbishop Courtenay. It {{was part of}} the {{establishment}} of the nearby Archbishop's Palace, but was closed in 1546. The College church was the neighbouring Church of All Saints. Following its closure, the College estate was sold. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> land passed through the ownership of three aristocratic families, being farmed until the late 19th century. A number of the College's buildings survive and all are listed buildings. Additionally, the whole site of the College is protected as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|The RLM {{considered}} {{setting up}} production facilities in Slovakia. But this would delay production until <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> factories could be furnished {{with the machine}} tools. These tools were also in short supply, and the RLM hoped to purchase them from Switzerland and Italy. The Slovaks could provide 3,500–4,000 workers, but no technical personnel. The move would only produce another 25 machines per month {{at a time when}} demand was increasing. In October, production plans were dealt another blow when one of WFGs plants burned down, leaving a chronic shortage of tailwheels and undercarriage parts. Junkers director and member of the Luftwaffe industry council Carl Frytag reported that by January 1943 only 120 Ju 87s could be produced at Bremen and 230 at Berlin-Tempelhof.|$|E

5|$|The Scarborough Day School was {{a private}} school in Scarborough-on-Hudson, in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip {{established}} the school in 1913 at their estate, Beechwood. The school, a nonsectarian nonprofit college preparatory day school, taught students at pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade levels and had small class sizes, with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students. Since 1980, <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> property have been owned by The Clear View School, which runs a day treatment program for 83 students. The current school still uses the Scarborough School's theater, which was opened in 1917. The school campus is a contributing property to the Scarborough Historic District.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> land were {{auctioned}} off in July 1843 and purchased for £5,100 by W. G. Hicks, an ironmonger.

Imprisonment for debt was finally outlawed in England in 1869, except in cases of fraud or refusal to pay, and in the 1870s the Home Office demolished most of the prison buildings, though in 1955 parts of it were still in use by George Harding & Sons, hardware merchants.|$|E
5|$|The local Partisans {{had been}} advised of the {{presence}} of the camp and the children, probably by Branko Davila, a doctor who had worked at the pre-existing children's home on the camp site. At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked the camp and dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by the nuns to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> rescued many children. Some of the fighters even found a brother or sister within the camp. The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away from the camp all the children that could walk.|$|E
