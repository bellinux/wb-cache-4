Philip threatened to invade Normandy if this did not happen. He also reopened the question of the Vexin which had formed part of Margaret's dowry several years before; Henry still occupied the region and now Philip insisted that the King either complete the long agreed Richard-Alice marriage, or return Margaret's dowry. Philip invaded the Berry and Henry mobilised a large army which confronted the French at Châteauroux, before papal intervention brought a truce.
