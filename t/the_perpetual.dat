5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as <b>the</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by <b>the</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Emigration Fund.|$|E

5|$|By 1857 <b>the</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Emigration Fund was exhausted; {{almost all}} of the {{handcart}} emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way to Utah to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony with <b>the</b> <b>perpetual</b> cession of Hong Kong Island {{from the}} Qing Empire after the First Opium War (1839–1842). The colony {{expanded}} to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection {{between himself and the}} other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In <b>The</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.|$|E

5|$|Young {{proposed}} {{the plan in}} a letter to Franklin D. Richards, President of the European Mission, in September 1855. His letter was published in the Millennial Star, the Church's England-based periodical, on December 22, 1855, along with an editorial by Richards endorsing the project. The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by one-third. The response was overwhelming – in 1856 <b>the</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Emigration Fund supported the travel of 2,012 European emigrants, compared with 1,161 the year before.|$|E

5|$|The son of William and Ida Steege, Gordon Henry Steege {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood on 31October 1917, and educated at North Sydney Boys High School. He {{recalled}} having always been interested in a military career, applying unsuccessfully to enter the Royal Australian Navy when he was twelve, and the Royal Military College, Duntroon, after he left school and started working with <b>the</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Trustee Company. On 21July 1937, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), undergoing flight instruction at No.1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria. He graduated with a distinguished pass on 23June 1938, and was commissioned a pilot officer. His first posting was to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, flying Hawker Demon biplane fighters. Steege and the squadron participated in several exercises with the Australian Army, undertaking reconnaissance, spotting for artillery, and practising ground-attack missions. He was promoted to flying officer in December 1938.|$|E
5|$|John of Austria, {{the victor}} of Lepanto and {{replacement}} to Requesens, {{had no choice}} but to sign <b>the</b> <b>Perpetual</b> Edict in 1577, accepting the Pacification of Ghent, but later, frustrated by the intransigence of Orange and his supporters, he seized the citadel of Namur and recalled his troops. John's striking victory at the Battle of Gembloux in January 1578, was followed by a tactical defeat at Rijmenam in July, and John himself died of plague in October. However, despite the Spanish failure to exploit militarily the victory of Gembloux, it rendered important political benefits to the royal cause in the Netherlands, as it shattered the unity of the Dutch rebels. As a consequence of the battle's outcome, the leaders of the main families of the Southern provinces lost faith in Orange's cause and the promises of aid made by the English queen Elizabeth I, which meant an important setback to Orange. Aiming to restore the military capability of the Dutch rebels, Elizabeth arranged with John Casimir, son to the Calvinist Elector Palatine, the raising of a German Army under English pay to assist the Dutch troops John Casimir brought to the Netherlands 11,000 men, but instead of fighting the Spanish, he sided with the Calvinist extremists at Ghent and widened the gap between the Catholic and Protestant rebels. The States General also called for help Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother and heir of the King of France, who entered Mons in July 1578, but was back in France in a short time.|$|E
5|$|Under Abbot Edward Knowle (1306–1332), a major {{rebuilding}} of the Abbey church began despite financial problems. Between 1298 and 1332 {{the eastern part}} of the abbey church was rebuilt in the English Decorated Gothic style. He also rebuilt the cloisters, the canons' dining room, the King's Hall and the King's Chamber. The Black Death is likely to have affected the monastery and when William Coke became abbot in 1353 he obtained a papal bull from Pope Urban V to allow him ordain priests at a younger age to replace those who had died. Soon after the election of his successor, Henry Shellingford, in 1365 Edward III took control of the monsatery and made The 4th Baron Berkeley its commissioner to resolve the financial problems. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries Abbots Cernay and Daubeney restored the fortunes of the order, partly by obtaining <b>the</b> <b>perpetual</b> vicarage of several local parishes. These difficulties meant that little building work had been undertaken for nearly 100 years. However, in the mid-15th century, the number of Canons increased and the transept and central tower were constructed. Abbot John Newland, (1481–1515), also known as 'Nailheart' due to his rebus of a heart pierced by three nails, began the {{rebuilding of}} the nave, but it was incomplete at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Newland also rebuilt the cloisters, the upper part of the Gatehouse, the canons' dormitory and dining room, and the Prior's Lodging (parts of which remained until 1884 as they were built into Minster House).|$|E
