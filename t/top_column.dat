40|$|AbstractMonte-Carlo {{simulation}} is {{the most}} popular and simplest method for nonlinear statistical tolerance analysis. Random values for every part are got according to the part distributions, and the value of the response function is computed for each set of part values. A sample of response function values is thus got, and the moments of the sample are computed using the standard statistical formula. Atpresent, the researches on assembly tolerance analysis have been focused on dimension tolerance and hardly take geometric tolerance intoconsideration. In this paper, geometric tolerance is treated as dimension tolerance whose nominal value is zero, and the Monte Carlo SimulationMethod is applied to tolerance analysis including geometric tolerance. Finally, a case of a <b>top</b> <b>column</b> assembly verifies the validity and accuracy of the method...|$|E
40|$|Monostructured {{single-wall}} carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) {{are important}} in both scientifi c research and electronic and biomedical applications; however, the bulk separation of SWCNTs into populations of single-chirality nanotubes remains challenging. Here we report a simple and effective method for the large-scale chirality separation of SWCNTs using a single-surfactant multicolumn gel chromatography method utilizing one surfactant {{and a series of}} vertically connected gel columns. This method is based on the structure-dependent interaction strength of SWCNTs with an allyl dextran-based gel. Overloading an SWCNT dispersion on the <b>top</b> <b>column</b> results in the adsorption sites of the column becoming fully occupied by the nanotubes that exhibit the strongest interaction with the gel. The unbound nanotubes fl ow through to the next column, and the nanotubes with the second strongest interaction with the gel are adsorbed in this stage. In this manner, 13 different (n, m) species were separated. Metallic SWCNTs were fi nally collected as unbound nanotubes because they exhibited the lowest interaction with the gel...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{regulations}} and constraints have renewed interest for more efficient distillation process in separating azeotropic mixtures and close boiling components. We investigate {{the feasibility of}} heterogeneous extractive distillation process in a continuous column considering several feed point strategies for the entrainer recycle stream and for the main azeotropic feed. Depending on these choices, the heterogeneous distillation column is composed of one, two or three column sections. A differential mass balance model enables to compute continuous liquid composition profiles of the rectifying, extractive and stripping sections. Unlike homogeneous extractive distillation, reflux policy composed by a single or both decanted liquid phases is considered {{as well as the}} external feeding influence on the composition of the <b>top</b> <b>column</b> liquid stream. Limiting operating conditions of key parameters like the entrainer/feed flowrate ratio and reflux ratio required to obtain a target top and bottom product compositions are obtained. For illustration, separation of acetonitrile – water mixture using butyl acetate as a heavy heterogeneous entrainer is selected. In this case, withdrawal of a saddle binary heteroazeotrope is the main difference of this process compared with the well known heterogeneous azeotropic distillation process where the top vapor product is the lower boiling point of the ternary system...|$|E

40|$|In situ STAR (Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation) is an {{emerging}} remediation technology which uses smouldering combustion to destroy nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contamination in the subsurface. Since STAR smouldering travels through contaminated soils slowly (~ 0. 5 to 5 m/day) and subjects them to high temperatures (400 – 1000 °C), {{it is expected}} that this technology will thoroughly dry and sterilize the zones which it treats. Further, soils surrounding the treatment zone which are not smouldered will be heated, although not smouldered, by virtue of their proximity to STAR, impacting microbial communities within them. Therefore, the objectives of this work are to quantify the microbial repopulation of the STAR treated zone, and observe heating effects on microorganisms living in surrounding soils. STAR is currently being applied as a full scale, in situ remedy for coal tar beneath a former creosol manufacturing facility in New Jersey, USA. This study analyzed soil cores taken at regular intervals following STAR treatment, allowing time for groundwater to re-infiltrate and for microbial populations to potentially reestablish. Treated soil, as well as untreated soil above the treatment zone and groundwater were analyzed for bacteria abundance and microbial diversity. Results demonstrate rapid bacterial repopulation over a 2 -month period to ~ 107 gene copies/g of soil in the treated zone, and variable impacts within untreated soils. In general, long term microbial abundance was largely dependent on the amount of organic matter present in the soil following STAR. In order to examine microbial transport and repopulation of STAR treated soils in more detail, and to consider the effects of bio-stimulating amendments, a bench <b>top</b> <b>column</b> study using site soil and artificial groundwater explored the rate at which STAR-treated soil is repopulated with naturally occurring microorganisms in the presence and absence of lactate and elevated sulfate concentrations. Results demonstrated that this amendment scheme increased the carrying capacity of the STAR treated soil and shifted the microbial community to promote sulfate reducing bacteria. Overall, the work illustrates that microbial populations in STAR treated soil do recover via groundwater infiltration but robust communities will take time to naturally establish...|$|E
40|$|The {{volume of}} fluid with the {{continuum}} surface force (VOF-CSF) method {{has been used in}} the current numerical work to investigate the bubble formation and the bubble shape in a bubble column. The shape of the bubble has been tracked by using the piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC). The effect of orifice sizes ranging from 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm on the bubble formation stages (i. e., expansion, elongation and pinch off), bubble contact angle, departure diameter, time and shape of bubble was investigated under a constant inlet velocity (0. 2 m/s) boundary condition. It was found that a leading bubble required a longer time to detach from an orifice in comparison to the following bubbles, but interestingly the third bubble took quite longer time than the second bubbles. This model has also been used to study the effect of Bond number and Reynolds number on bubble formation. The velocity field around the bubble has a significant effect on bubble formation, when the Bond number and Reynolds numbers are changed. Moreover, the effect of trapezoidal type columns to the rise velocity of a single bubble was simulated using a couple level set {{volume of fluid}} (CLSVOF) method. The bubble rise velocity reduced with the increase of trapezoidal angle or with the decrease of the <b>top</b> <b>column</b> width. Subsequently, the bubble rising distance for a given particular total time reduced with the increase of the trapezoidal angle. The trapezoidal cavity enhanced the spatial or lateral distribution of a bubble to left and right of the column. The trapezoidal column also enhanced the change of bubble shape from elliptic to circle and vice versa with the increase of the time or the vertical height. Finally, the VOF-CSF method was applied to investigate the effect of non-dimensional liquid viscosity and the effect of non-dimensional surface tension coefficient on co-axial and parallel bubble coalescence as well as rise trajectories in stagnant liquid. It was found that the coalescence time of two co-axial bubbles decreased with the reducing surface tension coefficient and reducing liquid viscosity. For the parallel bubbles coalescence, non-dimensional critical flat gap of bubble coalescence (Sc) decreased with the increase of bubble diameter under reduction of surface tension coefficient. But Sc increased with reduction of liquid viscosity. When the initial flat gaps of bubble are larger from Sc; the parallel bubbles enchanted by its repulsive effect. The findings from these works may be able to provide a fundamental knowledge and also be useful for designing a sparger for bubble column reactors...|$|E
