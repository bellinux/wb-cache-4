5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of high-explosive shells made {{the use of}} iron armor plate on warships necessary. In 1859 France launched , the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, Gloire was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. Gloire prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.|$|E

25|$|After The Tipping Point, Gladwell {{published}} Blink in 2005. The book {{explains how}} the human unconscious interprets events or cues and how past experiences can lead {{people to make}} informed decisions very rapidly, using examples like the Getty kouros and psychologist John Gottman's research on the likelihood of divorce in married couples. Gladwell's hair was the inspiration for Blink. He stated that he started to get speeding tickets all the time, an oddity considering that he had never gotten one before, and that he started getting pulled out of airport security lines for special attention. In a particular incident, he was accosted by three police officers while walking in downtown Manhattan, because his curly hair matched <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rapist, {{despite the fact that the}} suspect looked nothing like him otherwise.|$|E

Working with spheroid and toroid sections for the first time, Betwixt the Torus and the Sphere (2001) and Union of the Torus and the Sphere (2001) introduced entirely new shapes into Serra's sculptural vocabulary.

The Hyades span about 5° of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye.

Analyses revealed that girls with high levels of hypermaturity exhibited high levels of internalizing problem behaviour and conflict with parents, while hypermaturity in boys was only associated with internalizing problems. Immature girls had low levels of anxiety and high levels of minor delinquency, whereas immature boys reported low levels of anxiety and high levels of physical maturity.

Instead of being designed with a matching socket, the Europlug {{was designed to be}} compatible with a range of sockets in common use throughout mainland Europe. These sockets, including the CEE7/1, CEE7/3 (German/"Schuko"), CEE7/5 (French), and most Israeli, Swiss, Danish and Italian sockets, were designed to accept pins of various diameters, mainly 4.8mm but also 4.0mm and 4.5mm, and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 A or 16 A overcurrent protection devices. To improve contact with socket parts intended to receive pins having a diameter larger than 4.0mm, the Europlug has two round, slightly flexible pins which converge slightly towards their free ends.|$|E

The Palestinians would be wise to concentrate their struggle against the settlements, avoid harming women and children and strictly refrain from firing on Gilo, Nahal Oz or Sderot; it would also be smart to stop planting bombs {{to the west of the}} Green Line.
