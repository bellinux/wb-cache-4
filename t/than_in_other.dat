5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is closely}} related to the much larger and more recent tyrannosaurid Tyrannosaurus rex. Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal {{predator}} equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. Daspletosaurus had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, although they were proportionately longer <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> genera.|$|E

5|$|It is {{anticipated}} that rates of OHS will rise as {{the prevalence of}} obesity rises. This may also explain why OHS is more commonly reported in the United States, where obesity is more common <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> countries.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E

5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> {{branches of}} the East German armed forces.

5|$|Heinrich Mallison in 2011 {{argued that}} Opisthocoelicaudia {{was able to}} angle the {{anterior}} part of the tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in midsection. Thus, the anterior part {{would have been more}} straight during rearing <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. Common features of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as adaptations to rearing.|$|E
5|$|In 1671 Morgan {{attacked}} Panama City, {{landing on}} the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was on the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> raids. To appease the Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but {{was treated as a}} hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{unemployment}} rate varies much more in some regions of Canada <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>others.</b> Denton has documented this for the period 1947 - 1964 (4), and updating his data does not change the conclusions. In principle, the unemployment rate could fluctuate more <b>in</b> one region <b>than</b> another either because employment varied more around its trend or because the labour force varied more round its trend. In this paper, we focus on the proximate reasons for employment fluctuating more about its trend <b>in</b> some regions <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>others.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended Chilean Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further {{away from the body}} <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for {{the fact that there is}} no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{properties}} in Salta is known to date from the 16th century, and the hamlet has been continually inhabited ever since. During the Second World War, 43 evacuees from the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne area were billeted to the parish of Holme St. Cuthbert, and several ended up in Salta. Development in the 20th century saw new houses built, but mainline water and electricity arrived later <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> parts of Britain, perhaps due to the small population. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside, beyond the Moss to the southeast of Salta, were conducted in 1989–1990 by Robert H. Bewley.|$|E
