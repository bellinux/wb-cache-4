Knock-out of the kinase in both tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle significantly reduced contraction and myosin phosphorylation responses to K+-depolarization and acetylcholine. Kinase-deficient mice lacked bronchial constrictions in normal and asthmatic airways, whereas the asthmatic inflammation response was not affected.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of the biochemical states to the mechanical events in contraction of smooth muscle cross-bridges is reviewed. These studies use direct measurements of the kinetics of Pi and ADP release. The rate of release of Pi from thiophosphorylated cycling cross-bridges held isometric was biphasic with turnovers of 1. 8 s- 1 and 0. 3 s- 1, reflecting properties and forces directly acting on cross-bridges through mechanisms such as positive strain and inhibition by high-affinity MgADP binding. Fluorescent transients reporting release of an ADP analogue 3 '-deac-edaADP were significantly faster in phasic than in <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscles. Thiophosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains (RLCs) increased and positive strain decreased the release rate around twofold. The rates of ADP release from rigor cross-bridges and the steady-state Pi release from cycling isometric cross-bridges are similar, indicating that the ADP-release step or an isomerization preceding it may limit the ATPase rate. Thus ADP release in phasic and <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscles is a regulated step with strain- and dephosphorylation-dependence. High affinity of cross-bridges for ADP and slow ADP release prolong the fraction of the duty cycle occupied by strongly bound AM.

In addition, studies were performed to determine the relationship between the decreases in the basal IAS tone vs. the ROK activity. Confocal microscopic studies determined the cellular distribution of smooth muscle predominant isoform of ROK (ROCK-II) in the smooth muscle cells (SMC). Results: In in vitro studies using neurohumoral inhibitors and tetrodotoxin, and the use of SMC demonstrate direct relaxation of the IAS SMC by Y 27632. The ROK inhibitor was more potent in the IAS than the RSM. The IAS relaxation by Y 27632 correlated specifically with the decrease in ROK activity. Confocal microscopy revealed high levels of ROCK-II towards the periphery of the IAS SMC. In in vivo studies, the lower doses of Y 27632 caused a potent and selective fall in the IAS pressures (IASP) without any adverse cardiovascular systemic effects.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} characteristics of smooth muscle can be broadly defined as either phasic, or fast contracting, and tonic, or slow contracting (Somlyo and Somlyo, 1968, Pharmacol. Rev. 20 : 197 – 272). To determine if {{differences in the}} cross-bridge cycle and/or distribution of the cross-bridge states could contribute to differences in the mechanical properties of smooth muscle, we determined force and stiffness {{as a function of}} frequency in Triton-permeabilized strips of rabbit portal vein (phasic) and aorta (tonic). Permeabilized muscle strips were mounted between a piezoelectric length driver and a piezoresistive force transducer. Muscle length was oscillated from 1 to 100 Hz, and the stiffness was determined as a function of frequency from the resulting force response. During calcium activation (pCa 4, 5 mM MgATP), force and stiffness increased to steady-state levels consistent with the attachment of actively cycling cross-bridges. In smooth muscle, because the cross-bridge states involved in force production have yet to be elucidated, the effects of elevation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and MgADP on steady-state force and stiffness were examined. When portal vein strips were transferred from activating solution (pCa 4, 5 mM MgATP) to activating solution with 12 mM Pi, force and stiffness decreased proportionally, suggesting that cross-bridge attachment is associated with Pi release. For the aorta, elevating Pi decreased force more than stiffness, suggesting the existence of an attached, low-force actin-myosin-ADP- Pi state. When portal vein strips were transferred from activating solution (pCa 4, 5 mM MgATP) to activating solution with 5 mM MgADP, force remained relatively constant, while stiffness decreased ∼ 50 %. For the aorta, elevating MgADP decreased force and stiffness proportionally, suggesting for <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle that a significant portion of force production is associated with ADP release. These data suggest that in the portal vein, force is produced either concurrently with or after Pi release but before MgADP release, whereas in aorta, MgADP release is associated with a portion of the cross-bridge powerstroke. These differences in cross-bridge properties could contribute to the mechanical differences in properties of phasic and <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle...|$|R
40|$|Smooth muscle {{contraction}} {{is regulated}} by the phosphorylation of myosin. It {{is well known that}} <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscles can maintain force with low energy consumption (latch state); however, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unresolved. Here we show that single-head phosphorylated smooth myosin (SHPMII) exhibits fast (∼ 24 s– 1) and slow prolonged (∼ 1 s– 1) actin interactions, whereas double-head phosphorylated myosin (DHPMII) predominantly exhibits the fast (∼ 29 s– 1) interaction, suggesting that the phosphorylated head of SHPMII is mechanically as active as that of DHPMII. Both the fast and the slow actin interactions of SHPMII support the positive net mechanical displacement of actin. The actin translocating velocity of SHPMII was much slower than that of DHPMII, which is consistent with the slow actin interaction of SHPMII. We propose that the “latch state” {{can be explained by the}} motor characteristics of SHPMII that is present during the sustained phase of contraction...|$|R

Methods Isometrically mounted mucosa free rabbit bladder strips were contracted with carbachol and relaxed with 8 -Br-cGMP, forskolin, or isoprenaline. Results Contraction was associated with a highly cooperative relation between MRLC phosphorylation and force such that very small increases in MRLC phosphorylation induced large increases in force. Relaxation induced by 8 -Br-cGMP, forskolin, or isoprenaline did not shift the MRLC phosphorylation-force relation from that observed with carbachol alone, i. e. there was no force suppression.

40|$|Two novel {{methods used}} to study smooth muscles-electron probe X-ray {{microanalysis}} and Ca 2 +-sensitive indicators (which are used for resolving, respectively, the spatial distribution and temporal distribution of calcium) -are briefly reviewed and the major findings obtained are summarized. In smooth muscle the sarcoplasmic reticulum is the major intracellular source of Ca 2 +; mitochondria do not {{play a significant role}} in the physiological regulation of [Ca 2 +]i. Under pathological conditions mitochondria can reversibly accumulate large amounts of calcium. Resting [Ca 2 +]i generally ranges from 80 to 200 nM, and is lower in phasic than in <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscles. Removal of extracellular Ca 2 + and Ca 2 + entry blockers can reduce [Ca 2 +]i, but the effects of beta-adrenergic agents are variable. Increases in [Ca 2 +]i are triggered by electrical stimulation, depolarization with high K+, and excitatory agonists. Stretch, after a delay of several seconds, can cause an increase in [Ca 2 +]i in some smooth muscles. There is also a delay of approximately 200 - 400 ms between the initiation of the rise of Ca 2 + and contraction that follows spontaneous action potentials or electrical stimulation. Agonist-induced Ca 2 + release, a major mechanism of pharmacomechanical coupling, has been demonstrated in smooth muscles depolarized with high K; evidence suggests that it is mediated by G proteins that couple receptors to phospholipase C. Ca 2 + release can be triggered directly in permeabilized smooth muscle with inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate. Even though Ca 2 + is the major physiological regulator of contraction, Ca 2 + sensitivity of the regulatory-contractile apparatus differs in different (phasic and <b>tonic)</b> <b>smooth</b> muscles, and can be modulated in a given smooth muscle. The force [Ca 2 +]i ratio is higher during agonist-stimulated than during high K+-induced contractions, owing to agonist-induced increases in Ca 2 + sensitivity mediated by G proteins. In some phasic smooth muscles (guinea pig ileum), the time course of the initial myosin light chain phosphorylation is extremely rapid and returns to basal levels while force remains elevated. In these smooth muscles there is also a marked decrease in the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the regulatory-contractile apparatus during maintained depolarization in Ca 2 +-free or low Ca 2 + solutions. It has been suggested that regulation of myosin light chain phosphatase plays a major role in the modulation of the Ca 2 + sensitivity manifested as either potentiation or desensitization to [Ca 2 +]i. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) {{smooth muscle}} {{possesses}} distinct regional and functional properties that {{distinguish it from}} other types of visceral and vascular smooth muscle. On the basis of electrical properties and contractile phenotype, GI smooth muscles have been classified into phasic (non-sphinteric) and <b>tonic</b> (sphinteric) <b>smooth</b> muscles. The biochemical basis of phasic and <b>tonic</b> phenotypes of <b>smooth</b> muscle is not clear and is the major question of inquiry of the present study. Phosphorylation of Ser 19 on the 20 kDa myosin light chain (MLC) is essential for acto-myosin interaction and contraction in both phasic and tonic muscles. The levels of MLC 20 phosphorylation are regulated by Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent MLC kinase (MLCK) and MLC phosphatase (MLCP), and the activity of these enzymes are in turn regulated by various signaling molecules whose expression and activity are important in determining the strength and duration of their activity. The signaling proteins are AMP kinase (MLCK activity), Rho kinase, zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK), CPI- 17 and telokin (MLCP activity), phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5) and multi-drug resistance protein 5 (MRP 5). The overarching goal of the dissertation is to identify {{the differences in the}} signaling pathways that regulate MLCK and MLCP activities, and thus MLC 20 phosphorylation and muscle function. Using biochemical, molecular and functional approaches, and antrum (distal stomach) and fundus (proximal stomach) of rabbit stomach as models of phasic and <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscles, respectively, the present study characterized important differences in the signaling pathways that highly correlate with the contractile phenotype. These include: 1) tissue-specific expression of contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain isoforms, actin, caldesmon, calponin, - and β-tropomyosin, smoothelin-A and -B; 2) higher expression of AMPK, selective feedback inhibition of MLCK activity via AMPK-mediated phosphorylation, and higher expression of telokin and activation of MLCP correlate with the rapid cyclical contractile function in phasic muscle; 3) higher expression and activation of Rho kinase/ZIPK/MYPT 1 and PKC/CPI- 17 pathways, preferential inhibition of MLCP activity, and sustained phosphorylation of MLC 20 correlate with the sustained contraction in tonic muscle; and 4) rapid termination of cGMP signal and muscle relaxation by preferential degradation and efflux of cGMP via higher expression of PDE 5 and MRP 5, respectively, correlate with the brief relaxation and rapid restoration of contraction in tonic muscle. It is anticipated that these findings could be important in providing the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of smooth muscle function and new insights for the development of therapeutic agents that should act on smooth muscle in the gut to treat motility disorders as well as in other regions such as airways and vascular smooth muscle where similar intracellular mechanisms may prevail...|$|R

We studied potential differences in the expression levels of six contractile proteins in secondary and tertiary branches of the inferior mesenteric artery and vein along with differences in the vessel wall morphology. Results Bright field and electron microscopy showed that both vessel walls had the same major structural elements. The arterial walls, however, had greater number, and more tightly assembled, smooth muscle cell layers compared to vein walls. The content of actin, myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain, and calponin was similar in the two blood vessels. The artery expressed higher amount of the actin-binding protein caldesmon than the vein (41. 86 ± 2. 33 and 30. 13 ± 3. 37 μg/mg respectively, n = 12).

This study investigated the effects of colitis on the contractile effects of motilin, an important endocrine regulator of gastric motility, in the antrum. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, NF-kappaB activity and motilin receptor density were determined in the antrum of rabbits 5 days after the induction of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid colitis. Smooth muscle and neural responses to motilin were studied in antral smooth muscle strips in vitro. KEY RESULTS: Colitis did not affect MPO activity, but increased NF-kappaB activity in the antrum. Motilin receptor density in the antrum was not affected. Under control conditions, motilin induced a slowly developing <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle contraction. Five days post-inflammation, tonic contractions to motilin were reduced and preceded by a rapid initial contraction. Other kinases were recruited for the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) (a multi-functional MLC kinase), and for the inhibition of MLC phosphatase (Rho kinase in addition to protein kinase C) to mediate the motilin-induced contractions during inflammation. Colitis potentiated the cholinergic neural on-contractions in the antrum. This {{was associated with a}} hyper-reactivity to motilin and an increased muscle response to ACh. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Colitis altered the course of the motilin-induced smooth muscle contraction in the antrum. This involved changes in the kinases phosphorylating MLC.

Applying genome-wide miRNA microarrays on the phenotypically distinct smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the rat anorectrum, we identified miRNA- 139 - 5 p as differentially expressed RNA repressor with highest expression in the purely phasic smooth muscle of anococcygeus (ASM) vs. the truly <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle of IAS. This pattern of miRNA- 139 - 5 p expression, previously shown to target ROCK 2, was validated by target prediction using ingenuity pathway (IPA) and by qPCR analyses. Immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry (ICC), and functional assays using IAS tissues and cells subjected to overexpression/knockdown of miRNA- 139 - 5 p confirmed the inverse relationship between miRNA- 139 - 5 p and ROCK 2 expressions/IAS tone. Overexpression of miRNA- 139 - 5 p caused a decrease, while knockdown by anti-miRNA- 139 - 5 p caused an increase in the IAS tone; these tissue contractile responses were confirmed by single-cell contraction using magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC). These findings suggest miRNA- 139 - 5 p is capable of significantly influencing the phenotypic tonicity in smooth muscle via ROCK 2 : a lack of tone in ASM may be associated with the suppression of ROCK 2 by high expression of miRNA- 139 - 5 p, whereas basal IAS tone may be associated with the persistence of ROCK 2 due to low expression of miRNA- 139 - 5 p...|$|R

K(+) -rich solutions increased [Ca 2 +]i and force to an initial peak value, which {{was determined by the}} concentration of [K+]o. Thereafter, [Ca 2 +]i and force declined to a lower maintained level. The Ca 2 +/force relationship observed during this contraction-relaxation cycle is represented by a clockwise hysteresis loop. At 140 mM [K+]o, this loop consisted of three components while at lower [K+]o a two-component loop was observed. The stimulation with 0. 1 mM carbachol resulted in a transient increase of [Ca 2 +]i and force followed by a continuous decline of these parameters despite the presence of the drug. Its EC 50 of relaxation was around 270 nM [Ca 2 +]i. The Ca 2 +/force relationship proceeded along a counterclockwise hysteresis loop during the contraction-relaxation cycle. The extent of this loop decreased but remained unaltered in its direction during repeated stimulation with carbachol. These results suggest that (a) both agonists increase force and [Ca 2 +]i during stimulation; (b) during depolarization with K+, desensitization to CA 2 + occurs resulting in a clockwise hysteresis loop; (c) during carbachol stimulation, a counterclockwise hysteresis is observed. This could be due to an increased sensitivity to Ca 2 + mainly in <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle.

In femoral artery at low, {{but not at}} high, [MgATP]/[MgADP] the force and the ratio of stiffness/force at pCa 7. 2 were significantly higher under the calcium-descending than calcium-ascending protocols (54 % vs. 3 % of Po, the force at pCa 6. 0) (force hysteresis); the levels of regulatory myosin light chain (MLC 20) phosphorylation (9 +/- 2 % vs. 10 +/- 2 %) and the velocities of unloaded shortening V 0 (0. 02 +/- 0. 004 l/s with both protocols) were not significantly different. No significant force hysteresis was detected in rabbit ileum under either of these experimental conditions. [MgADP], measured in extracts of permeabilized femoral artery strips by two methods, was 130 - 140 microM during maintained force under the calcium-descending protocol.

40|$|Myo 1 c is one {{of eight}} members of the {{mammalian}} myosin I family of actin-associated molecular motors. In stereocilia of the hair cells in the inner ear, Myo 1 c presumably serves as the adaptation motor, which regulates the opening and closing of transduction channels. Although there is conservation of sequence and structure among all myosins in the N-terminal motor domain, which contains the nucleotide- and actin-binding sites, some differences include the length and composition of surface loops, including loop 1, which lies near the nucleotide-binding domain. To investigate the role of loop 1, we expressed in insect cells mutants of a truncated form of Myo 1 c, Myo 1 c 1 IQ, as well as chimeras of Myo 1 c 1 IQ with the analogous loop from other myosins. We found that replacement of the charged residues in loop 1 with alanines or the whole loop {{with a series of}} alanines did not alter the ATPase activity, transient kinetics properties, or Ca 2 + sensitivity of Myo 1 c 1 IQ. Substitution of loop 1 with that of the corresponding region from <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle myosin II (Myo 1 c 1 IQ-tonic) or replacement with a single glycine (Myo 1 c 1 IQ-G) accelerated the release of ADP from A. M 2 − 3 -fold in Ca 2 +, whereas substitution with loop 1 from phasic muscle myosin II (Myo 1 c 1 IQ-phasic) accelerated the release of ADP 35 -fold. Motility assays with chimeras containing a single α-helix, or SAH, domain showed that Myo 1 cSAH-tonic translocated actin in vitro twice as fast as Myo 1 cSAH-WT and 3 -fold faster than Myo 1 cSAH-G. The studies show that changes induced in Myo 1 c via modification of loop 1 showed no resemblance to the behavior of the loop donor myosins or to the changes previously observed with similar Myo 1 b chimeras...|$|R

40|$|Many {{cellular}} {{functions are}} regulated by agonist-induced InsP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + {{release from the}} internal store. In non-excitable cells, predominantly, the initial Ca 2 + release from the store by InsP 3 {{is followed by a}} more sustained elevation in [Ca 2 +]i via store-operated Ca 2 + channels as a consequence of depletion of the store. Here, in smooth muscle, we report that the initial transient increase in Ca 2 +, from the internal store, is followed by a sustained response also as a consequence of depletion of the store (by InsP 3), but, influx occurs via voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels. Contractions were measured in pieces of whole distal colon and membrane currents and [Ca 2 +]i in single colonic myocytes. Carbachol evoked phasic and tonic contractions; only the latter were abolished in Ca 2 +-free solution. The tonic component was blocked by the voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel blocker nimodipine but not by the store-operated channel blocker SKF 96365. InsP 3 receptor inhibition, with 2 -APB, attenuated both the phasic and tonic components. InsP 3 may regulate tonic contractions via sarcolemma Ca 2 + entry. In single cells, depolarisation (to ~- 20 mV) elevated [Ca 2 +]i and activated spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs). CCh suppressed STOCs, as did caffeine and InsP 3. InsP 3 receptor blockade by 2 -APB or heparin prevented CCh suppression of STOCs; protein kinase inhibition by H- 7 or PKC 19 - 36 did not. InsP 3 suppressed STOCs by depleting a Ca 2 + store accessed separately by the ryanodine receptor (RyR). Thus depletion of the store by RyR activators abolished the InsP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + transient. RyR inhibition (by tetracaine) reduced only STOCs but not the InsP 3 transient. InsP 3 contributes to both phasic and tonic contractions. In the former, muscarinic receptor-evoked InsP 3 releases Ca 2 + from an internal store accessed by both InsP 3 and RyR. Depletion of this store by InsP 3 alone suppresses STOCs, depolarises the sarcolemma and permits entry of Ca 2 + to generate the tonic component. Therefore, by lowering the internal store Ca 2 + content, InsP 3 may generate a sustained smooth muscle contraction. These results provide a mechanism to account for phasic and <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle contraction following receptor activation...|$|R
40|$|The cytoplasmic free calcium {{concentration}} ([Ca 2 +]i) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors in the regulation of the cellular activity. We therefore studied in this work the changes of [Ca 2 +]i during muscle excitation with optical techniques in intact smooth muscle preparations. Also the relation between [Ca 2 +]i, the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and the force development in phasic and <b>tonic</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle during excitation-contraction coupling was investigated. We concluded that the changes of [Ca 2 +]i and force are not invariably tightly coupled during stimulation in spite of the fact that the increase of [Ca 2 +]i is the primary regulator of smooth muscle contraction. Agonists may, besides their Ca 2 + mobilizing effect, also modulate the sensitivity of the regulatory-contractile apparatus for Ca 2 +. Ca(2 +) -release from the internal stores during activation may modulate its further depletion. We demonstrated that the Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 receptor is controlled by luminal Ca 2 +. These observations allowed us to develop a model whereby Ca 2 + oscillations during submaximal stimulation could be explained. This model of control by luminal Ca 2 + also explained why the release in response to a low Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 concentration suddenly stops at a time when there is still plenty of Ca 2 + in the internal stores. We furthermore showed that these Ca 2 + channels in the SR are controlled by the redox-status of the cell. The study of Ca 2 + extrusion was mainly focused on the Ca 2 + pump of the plasma-membrane and its regulation by negatively charged phospholipids. Our main finding was that the plasma-membrane Ca 2 + pump was stimulated by negatively charged phospholipids. Finally, we started the investigation of the existence of Ca 2 + gradients between nucleus and cytoplasm in intact cells with confocal laser microscopy. We demonstrated in different cell types the existence of spatio-temporal differences in the Ca 2 + distribution between nucleus and cytosol in basal and stimulated conditions. These observations indicate that a Ca 2 + barrier must be present at the nuclear envelope, that different Ca 2 + mobilizing phenomena are present and are in favour of the existence of a specific regulation of nuclear Ca 2 +. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia rapidly reduces {{force in}} many smooth muscles and we review recent data that {{shed light on}} the {{mechanisms}} involved. As many regulated cellular processes are integrated to co-ordinate smooth muscle contractility, the processes responsible for decreased force output with altered metabolism are also likely to be many, acting in concert, rather than the actions of one altered parameter. Nevertheless the aim {{of this study is to}} elucidate the hierarchical series of events that contribute to reduced smooth muscle force production during altered metabolism. We conclude that in many phasic smooth muscles the decrease in force can be attributed to impaired electro-mechanical coupling whereby the Ca 2 + transient is reduced. A direct effect of hypoxia on the Ca 2 + channel may be of key importance. In <b>tonic</b> vascular <b>smooth</b> muscles KATP channels may also play a role in the integrated functional responses to hypoxia. There are also many examples of force being reduced, in tonically activated preparations, without a fall in steady-state Ca 2 +; indeed it usually increases. We examine the roles of altered [ATP], pH, myosin phosphorylation, inorganic phosphate and proteolytic activity on the [Ca 2 +]-force relationship during hypoxia. We find no defining force-inhibitory role for any one factor acting alone, and suggest that force most probably falls as a result of the combination of myriad factors...|$|R
40|$|Sustained {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} contraction can be mediated by several mechanisms, including {{the influx of}} extracellular Ca 2 + through L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (LTCCs) and by RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) -dependent Ca 2 + sensitization of the contractile machinery. Conformational changes in the LTCC following depolarization can also trigger an ion-independent metabotropic pathway that involves G protein/phospholipase C activation, giving rise to inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate synthesis and subsequent Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (calcium channel-induced Ca 2 + release or calcium channel-induced calcium release [CCICR]). In this review, we summarize recent data suggesting that LTCC activation and subsequent metabotropic Ca 2 + release from the SR participate in depolarization-evoked RhoA/ROCK activity and sustained arterial contraction. During protracted depolarizations, refilling of the SR stores by a residual influx of extracellular Ca 2 + through LTCCs helps maintain RhoA activity and contractile activation.

40|$|Background] Sustained {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} contraction is mediated by extracellular Ca 2 + influx through L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (VGCC) and RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) -dependent Ca 2 + sensitization of the contractile machinery. VGCC activation can also trigger an ion-independent metabotropic pathway that involves G-protein/phospholipase C activation, inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate synthesis, and Ca 2 + {{release from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum (calcium channel-induced Ca release). We have studied the functional role of calcium channel-induced Ca release and the inter-relations between Ca 2 + channel and RhoA/ROCK activation. [Methods and results] We have used normal and genetically modified animals to study single myocyte electrophysiology and fluorimetry as well as cytosolic Ca 2 + and diameter in intact arteries. These analyses were complemented with measurement of tension and RhoA activity in normal and reversibly permeabilized arterial rings. We have found that, unexpectedly, L-type Ca channel activation and subsequent metabotropic Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum participate in depolarization-evoked RhoA/ROCK activity and sustained arterial contraction. We show that these phenomena do {{not depend on the}} change in the membrane potential itself, or the mere release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but they require the simultaneous activation of VGCC and the downstream metabotropic pathway with concomitant Ca 2 + release. During protracted depolarizations, refilling of the stores by a residual extracellular Ca 2 + influx through VGCC helps maintaining RhoA activity and sustained arterial contraction. [Conclusions] These findings reveal that calcium channel-induced Ca release has a major role in <b>tonic</b> vascular <b>smooth</b> muscle contractility because it links membrane depolarization and Ca channel activation with metabotropic Ca release and sensitization (RhoA/ROCK stimulation). © 2011 American Heart Association, Inc.

40|$|Pecten 'actomyosin' as {{prepared}} by the usual dilution-precipitation procedure is reasonably pure only when obtained from the striated adductor; when prepared from the <b>smooth</b> <b>tonic</b> adductor it consists of a protein mixture of about 1 / 3 actomyosin (AM) † and 2 / 3 tropomyosin A (TMA; paramyosin). This admixture accounts for the previously reported differences in adenosine triphosphatase (ATP-ase) activity of crude 'AM' from {{the two types of}} adductor muscles, since, afterpurification, all the biological activity characteristic of contractile proteins (ATP-ase activity, ATP-sensitivity and 'contractility') is associated with AM alone. In presenceof ATPthislatter can also be dissociated into actin and myosin. After purification by salting out, the myosinis quite distinct from TMA in its solubilityproperties and sedimentation constant, and, unlike tropomyosin but like rabbit myosin, it possesses ATP-ase activity and combineswith rabbit actin to form a synthetic or 'hybrid' actomyosinwith anATP-sensitivity of 45 %.

40|$|Myosin {{phosphatase}} (MLCP) plays {{a critical}} regulatory {{role in the}} Ca 2 + sensitivity of myosin phosphorylation and smooth muscle contraction. It {{has been suggested that}} phosphorylation at Thr 695 of the MLCP regulatory subunit (MYPT 1) and at Thr 38 of the MLCP inhibitor protein CPI- 17 results in inhibition of MLCP activity. We have previously demonstrated that CPI- 17 Thr 38 phosphorylation {{plays an important role in}} G-protein-mediated inhibition of MLCP in <b>tonic</b> arterial <b>smooth</b> muscle. Here, we attempted to evaluate the function of MYPT 1 in phasic rabbit portal vein (PV) and vas deferens (VD) smooth muscles. Using site- and phospho-specific antibodies, phosphorylation of MYPT 1 Thr 695 and CPI- 17 Thr 38 was examined along with MYPT 1 Thr 850, which is a non-inhibitory Rho-kinase site. We found that both CPI- 17 Thr 38 and MYPT 1 Thr 850 were phosphorylated in response to agonists or GTPγS concurrently with contraction and myosin phosphorylation in α-toxin-permeabilized PV tissues. In contrast, phosphorylation of MYPT 1 Thr 695 did not increase. Comparable results were also obtained in both permeabilized and intact VD. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y- 27632 and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF 109203 X suppressed phosphorylation of MYPT 1 Thr 850 and CPI- 17 Thr 38, respectively, in intact VD while MYPT 1 Thr 695 phosphorylation was insensitive to both inhibitors. These results indicate that phosphorylation of MYPT 1 Thr 695 is independent of stimulation of G-proteins, Rho-kinase or PKC. In the phasic PV, phosphorylation of CPI- 17 Thr 38 may contribute towards inhibition of MLCP while the phasic visceral VD, which has a low CPI- 17 concentration, probably utilizes other Ca 2 + sensitizing mechanisms for inhibiting MLCP besides phosphorylation of MYPT 1 and CPI- 17...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{turnover}} in the isolated rat portal vein was investigated by measurement of oxygen consumption (JO 2) and lactate production (JLA) under simultaneous recording of mechanical activity. In spontaneous activity under aerobic conditions and at optimal muscle length JO 2 and JLA were 0. 55 and 0. 62 micromol/min X g, respectively, corresponding to an ATP-production of 4. 3 micromol/min X G. When muscle length was changed, an approximately linear relation {{was found between}} energy turnover and mean isometric tension. The tension-indpendent part of ATP-production was 3. 0 micromol/min X g. In Ca 2 +-free solution the metabolic rate was 20 % lower still. JO 2 was nearly equal in isometric contractions and in afterloaded isotonic contractions from the same initial muscle length. During a maximal tonic contracture in 5 +-depolarized portal vein JO 2 increased to about twice that in spontaneous activity. Changes in contracture force by variations in muscle length or in [Ca 2 +] 0 were associated with identical linear relations between JO 2 and active tension. This relation was less steep than the corresponding relation for spontaneous activity. The anaerobic lactate production of the portal vein was 2. 7 times theaerobic leve. The accelerated glycolysis did not compensate for eliminated oxidative metabolism. Under substrate-free aerobic conditions no lactate was produced by the muscle and compared to the control situation JO 2 declined more than could {{be accounted for by}} reduced mechanical activity alone. The metabolic turnover rate in relation to isometric tension is high in the rat portal vein compared to that of <b>tonic</b> vascular <b>smooth</b> muscle from larger vessels. This correlates with differences in dyanmic mechanical properties.

40|$|For a {{successful}} human pregnancy, the phasic smooth muscle of the myometrium must remain quiescent until labor. Activation of cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathways contributes to this quiescence. The small heat-shock protein 20 (HSP 20) is {{a target of}} PKA, and phosphorylated HSP 20 (pHSP 20) modulates relaxation of <b>tonic</b> vascular <b>smooth</b> muscle via interaction with actin, independent of myosin dephosphorylation. Our objective {{was to determine whether}} relaxation in human myometrium is associated with changes in phosphorylation of HSP 20. Myometrium was obtained at elective cesarean. Elevating cAMP with forskolin or rolipram (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) caused substantial relaxation of spontaneously contracting human myometrial strips, of 92 ± 4 % (mean ± SEM, n = 10) and 84 = 7 % (n = 6), respectively. Subsequent two-dimensional electrophoresis with immunoblotting of strip extracts showed a significant 2. 6 - and 2. 1 -fold increase in phosphorylated HSP 20 (pHSP 20) after forskolin (P< 0. 01; n = 5) or rolipram treatment (P< 0. 05; n = 4). Noncyclic-nucleotide-mediated relaxation, induced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, did not alter pHSP 20. Inhibition of PKA with H 89 significantly attenuated rolipram-induced relaxation (P < 0. 01; n = 4), and partially reduced rolipram-stimulated pHSP 20. Total and pHSP 20 protein was unchanged in term laboring and nonlaboring myometria. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed a specific association of HSP 20 with alpha-smooth muscle actin and HSP 27, a key regulator of actin filament dynamics. Finally, coimmunofluorescence demonstrated moderate colocalization of HSP 20 with alpha-smooth muscle actin in the cytoplasm of laboring myometria. Our data support a novel role for pHSP 20 in the modulation of cyclic-nucleotide-mediated myometrial relaxation, through interaction with actin. pHSP 20 represents an important new target for future tocolytic therapy...|$|R
40|$|Smooth muscle {{contraction}} is {{initiated by}} {{a rise in}} intracellular calcium leading to activation of smooth muscle myosin light-chain kinase via calcium/calmodulin. Activated myosin light chain kinase then phosphorylates the regulatory myosin light chains, triggering cross-bridge cycling and contraction. Here we show that myosin light-chain kinase is a substrate of AMP-activated protein kinase. The phosphorylation site in chicken myosin light chain kinase was identified by mass spectrometry to {{be located in the}} calmodulin-binding domain at Ser 815. Phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase desensitized myosin light-chain kinase by increasing the concentration of calmodulin required for half-maximal activation. In primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells, vasoconstrictors activated AMP-activated protein kinase in a calcium-dependent manner via calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta, a known upstream kinase of AMP-activated protein kinase. Indeed, vasoconstrictor-induced AMP-activated protein kinase activation was abrogated by the STO- 609 calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta inhibitor. Myosin light chain phosphorylation was increased under these conditions, suggesting that contraction would be potentiated by ablation of AMP-activated protein kinase. Indeed in aortic rings from mice in which a 1, the major catalytic subunit isoform in arterial smooth muscle, had been deleted, KCl- or phenylephrine-induced contraction was increased. The findings suggest that AMP-activated protein kinase attenuates contraction by phosphorylating and inactivating myosin light chain kinase. This might contribute to reduced ATP turnover in the <b>tonic</b> phase of <b>smooth</b> muscle contraction...|$|R
40|$|Smooth muscle {{contraction}} is {{a complicated}} process coordinated by contractile, regulatory and cytoskeletal proteins. The force generation depends on the phosphorylation of Myosin Regulatory Light Chain (MLC 20). Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK) and Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP) are the two main regulators of the MLC 20 phosphorylation level. MLCP is further controlled by two known pathways including the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) / phospholipase C (PLC) / diacylglycerol (DAG) / protein kinase C (PKC) / PKC-potentiated inhibitory protein for heterotrimeric myosin light chain phosphatase of 17 kDa (CPI- 17) pathway. While messengers involved in this pathway have been proposed, studies {{on the details of}} the pathway are still controversial. This study explored the spatial-temporal regulation and distribution of PKCα and CPI- 17 in intact animal tissues. Immunohistochemical results show that the distribution of PKCα in the longitudinal and circular layers of the fundus and antrum under relaxed conditions was predominantly localized at or near the periphery of the smooth muscle cell. Stimulation of the tissues with 1 μM phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu) for 10 or 30 minutes or 1 μM carbachol (CCh) for 3 minutes does not alter the distribution pattern of PKCα. Different from PKCα, CPI- 17 appeared to be 2 ̆ 2 uniformly 2 ̆ 2 distributed throughout the smooth muscle cells under relaxed conditions. Stimulation of the tissues with 1 μM PDBu or 1 μM CCh for 30 minutes led to a significant distribution shift of CPI- 17 from throughout the cytosol to primarily at the cell periphery. Results from double labeling of PKCα and vinculin/talin under relaxed condition or CPI- 17 and vinculin/talin under stimulated condition suggested that PKCα and CPI- 17 were not associated with the adherens junction. It is likely that PKCα and CPI- 17 are localized at the caveolae on the plasma membrane. This study also revealed that the force generated in <b>tonic</b> fundus <b>smooth</b> muscle is much greater than that in phasic antrum tissue upon PDBu stimulation. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that this difference was not caused by a difference in the expression of PKCα or CPI- 17 between these two tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} [MgADP] on {{relaxation}} from isometric tension, initiated by reducing free [Ca 2 +] through photolysis of the caged photolabile Ca 2 + chelator diazo- 2, was determined at 20 degrees C in alpha-toxin permeabilized tonic (rabbit femoral artery, Rf) and phasic (rabbit bladder, Rb) smooth muscle. In Rf, {{the shape of}} the relaxation curve was clearly biphasic, consisting of a slow "plateau" phase followed by a monotonic exponential decline with rate constant k. The duration of the plateau (d = 44 +/- 4 s, mean +/- SEM, n = 28) was well correlated (R = 0. 92) with the total t 1 / 2 of relaxation that was 66 +/- 3 s (n = 28) in the presence of 20 mM creatine phosphate (CP), and was prolonged in the absence of CP (t 1 / 2 = 83 +/- 3 s, n = 7); addition of 100 microM MgADP further slowed relaxation (t 1 / 2 = 132 +/- 7 s, n = 14). In Rb, a plateau was not detectable and t 1 / 2 (= 15 +/- 2 s, n = 6) was not affected by 100 microM MgADP. In Rf the Q 10 between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C was 4. 3 +/- 0. 4 for d- 1 and 2. 8 +/- 0. 3 for k (n = 8; p = 0. 006). The regulatory myosin light chain (MLC 20) in Rf was dephosphorylated at 0. 07 +/- 0. 02 s- 1, from 42 +/- 3 % before to 20 +/- 2 % after photolysis of diazo- 2, reaching basal values at a time when force had fallen by only 40 %. We conclude that, in the presence of ATP, as during rigor, the affinity of dephosphorylated cross-bridges for MgADP is significantly higher in tonic than in phasic smooth muscle and contributes to the maintenance of force at low levels of phosphorylation. The MgADP dependence of the post-dephosphorylation phase of relaxation is consistent with its being rate-limited by the slow off-rate of ADP from cross-bridges that were dephosphorylated while in force-generating ADP-bound (AM*D) cross-bridge states. The fourfold faster off-rate of ADP from AM*D in the phasic, Rb, compared to <b>tonic,</b> Rf, <b>smooth</b> muscle is a major determinant of the different kinetics of relaxation in the two types of smooth muscle...|$|R
