5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> benefits.|$|E

Therefore, the total amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Several states have established incentives and tax exemptions for BEVs and PHEV, and other non-monetary incentives.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E

5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E

40|$|The FairTax is a {{proposal}} to replace <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> personal income <b>tax,</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> corporate income <b>tax,</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> payroll (FICA) <b>tax,</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> estate <b>tax,</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> gift <b>tax,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> generation-skipping <b>tax</b> with a <b>federal</b> retail sales <b>tax,</b> assessed at a single rate. The FairTax also provides a rebate to each household based on its demographic composition. The rebate is set to ensure that households living at or {{below the poverty line}} pay no taxes on net. This paper compares average and marginal labor income and saving tax rates under <b>the</b> current <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system and <b>the</b> FairTax. As specified in H. R. 25 /S. 25, the legislation that would implement the reform, the FairTax’s tax rate is 23 percent.

Although Gale (2005) questions whether a 23 percent tax-inclusive rate would suffice to maintain real federal spending and also cover the FairTax rebate, a recent analysis by Bachman, Haughton, Kotlikoff, Sanchez-Penalver, and Tuerck (2006) based on CBO 2007 projections indicates that less than a 3 percent scale-back of non-Social Security real federal expenditures would be needed to accommodate a 23 percent FairTax rate.

25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E
