5|$|In 2013 Voyager 1 was exiting <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> at a {{speed of}} about 3.6 AU per year, while Voyager 2 is going slower, leaving <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> at 3.3 AU per year. Each year Voyager 1 {{increases}} its lead over Voyager 2.|$|E

5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as having left <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, {{the two are}} not the same. <b>The</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun.

5|$|A recent {{modification}} of the Nice model has <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after the formation of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and {{after a series of}} encounters is ejected from <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>system.</b> (Many cosmic rays are {{kept out of}} <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>system</b> by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone {{who had been on}} the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> {{as we know}} it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> evolution, comets were ejected out of <b>the</b> inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> by <b>the</b> gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into <b>the</b> inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> <b>The</b> evolution of <b>the</b> outer <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> also {{appears to have been}} influenced by space weathering from <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near <b>the</b> inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> It receives <b>the</b> most frequent comet impacts of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number}} of comets that pass through <b>the</b> inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|R

5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> might have been ejected from <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E

5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System).</b> If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, it {{was shown}} that the {{presence}} of a smaller planet at Jupiter's position in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> might increase the impact rate of comets on the Earth significantly. A planet of Jupiter's mass still seems to provide increased protection against asteroids, but the total effect on all orbital bodies within <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is unclear.

5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> out of convenience.|$|E
