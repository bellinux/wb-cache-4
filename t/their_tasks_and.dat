This is essential for robots to perform <b>their</b> <b>tasks,</b> <b>and</b> act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response.

25|$|Within {{an hour of}} wounding, {{polymorphonuclear}} neutrophils (PMNs) {{arrive at}} the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound {{for the first two}} days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day. They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as kinins. Neutrophils phagocytise debris and kill bacteria by releasing free radicals in what is called a 'respiratory burst. They also cleanse the wound by secreting proteases that break down damaged tissue. Functional neutrophils at the wound site only have life-spans of around 2 days, so they usually undergo apoptosis once they have completed <b>their</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> are engulfed and degraded by macrophages.|$|E

500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch <b>their</b> <b>tasks,</b> <b>and</b> kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show {{the kinds of things that}} soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite." [...] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring [...] "the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of his or her aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward what everybody else is running from." ...|$|E

2500|$|Modernism, in general, {{includes}} {{the activities and}} creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and even the sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to <b>their</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to [...] "Make it new!" [...] was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the stream-of-consciousness novel, atonal (or pantonal) and twelve-tone music, divisionist painting and abstract art, all had precursors in the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} in [...] "the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron" [...] to direct them to count the Kohathites and in [...] "the Lord spoke to Moses" [...] to direct him to count the Gershonites, but [...] does not report that [...] "the Lord spoke" [...] to direct them to count the Merarites. The Midrash deduced that [...] {{employed}} the words [...] "the Lord spoke" [...] so as to give honor to Gershon as the firstborn, and {{to give him the}} same status as Kohath. The Midrash then noted that [...] reported that God spoke [...] "to Aaron" [...] with regard to the Kohathites but [...] did not report communication to Aaron with regard to the Gershonites. The Midrash taught that God excluded Aaron from all Divine communications to Moses and that passages that mention Aaron do not report that God spoke to Aaron, but include Aaron's name in sections that concern Aaron to indicate that God spoke to Moses so that he might repeat what he heard to Aaron. Thus [...] mentions Aaron regarding the Kohathites because Aaron and his sons assigned the Kohathites their duties, since (as [...] relates) the Kohathites were not permitted to touch the ark or any of the vessels until Aaron and his sons had covered them. In the case of the Gershonites, however, the Midrash finds no evidence that Aaron personally interfered with them, as Ithamar supervised <b>their</b> <b>tasks,</b> <b>and</b> thus [...] does not mention Aaron in connection with the Gershonites.|$|E

2500|$|When the Soviet Union {{joined the}} UCC, {{a new type}} of freely {{negotiable}} licences was introduced to facilitate dealing with publishers abroad, and in particular in the West. Copyrights, especially the right to publish a work, became transferrable through these licenses. The intention clearly was that the old-style authors' contracts were to be used amongst Soviet partners for domestic publication, whereas the new licensing scheme was to be [...] employed towards foreign publishers. Upon a decree of August 16, 1973, the [...] "All-Union Agency on Copyrights" [...] (VAAP [...] ) was founded on September 20, 1973. The VAAP replaced the several previously existing collecting societies (such as the VUOAP), taking over <b>their</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> additionally managing copyrights on foreign works in the USSR and also the copyrights on Soviet works abroad. Officially, the VAAP was a non-governmental organization sponsored by creative unions (such as the Union of Soviet Writers) and seven state organs; but for all practical purposes, it was a state agency. All contracts with foreign publishers had to be concluded through VAAP; authors were forbidden to negotiate directly with foreign publishers. In the standard authors' publishing contracts, an author transferred the right to use the work abroad to the first publisher; and publishers were also obliged to go through VAAP for international copyright deals. The VAAP held the state monopoly on the import and export of copyrights. Only the state organs for cinematography (Goskino, through its Soveksportfilm agency) and television and radio broadcasts (Gosteleradio), as well as the news agency Novosti were exempted from that monopoly, but even they had to register all contracts with foreign partners with VAAP.|$|E
