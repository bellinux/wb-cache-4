5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
25|$|Freddie Brown captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1950–51, {{playing as}} England in the 1950-51 Ashes {{series against the}} Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. They were {{regarded}} as a weak team - some critics wanted to cancel the tour - and failed to regain the Ashes. However, these facts do not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> as the inspirational Brown exposed flaws in the powerful Australian team. By winning the Fifth and final Test he ended Australia's record of 26 Tests without defeat and {{paved the way for}} England's victories in 1953, 1954-55 and 1956.|$|E
25|$|Shilts's {{writing was}} admired for its {{powerful}} narrative drive, interweaving personal stories with {{political and social}} reporting. Shilts saw himself as a literary journalist {{in the tradition of}} Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of firearms does not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> of the 19th century {{due to their}} mixed impact and use in many regions. Indeed, some historians argue that mere advanced technology was not the single most decisive factor {{in the outcome of}} many colonial conquests. More important, was the divided, fragmented nature of many small African polities that enabled them to be defeated separately by their enemies. Such fragmentation is not unique to Africa. Germany for example in 1815, was split into over 30 separate states. Despite these weaknesses, until well into {{the second part of the}} century, many native forces held their own until the coming of modern artillery, machine guns and rifles.|$|E
25|$|By {{elevating}} head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), {{a notable}} difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams {{with the same}} number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences {{at the end of the}} pool stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare. This also illustrates the fact that the pool tables do not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lulla Rosenfeld's {{remark that}} Adler [...] "...rel entirely on {{classics}} and translations of modern European plays" [...] does not quite <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story.</b> On one hand, {{he was also}} responsible for recruiting the Yiddish theater's first naturalistic playwright, Jacob Gordin, and he scored a great triumph {{in the title role}} of Gordin's Der Yiddisher King Lear (The Jewish King Lear), set in 19th-century Russia. On the other, until his 50s, he was not hesitant to take advantage of his prowess as a dancer, and even occasionally took on roles that called for some singing, although by all accounts (including his own) this was not his forte.|$|E
50|$|Years {{later she}} <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> to her son, as {{seen at the}} end of the film. Some {{versions}} (DVD English) leave out this scene and put the gist of its text over the scene before it.|$|R

500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is too soon yet to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story,</b> but someday I will tell it to you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was going to give him an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|E
500|$|However, the Cylinder's {{account of}} Cyrus's conquest clearly does not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story,</b> as it {{suppresses}} {{any mention of}} the earlier conflict between the Persians and the Babylonians; Max Mallowan describes it as a [...] "skilled work of tendentious history". The text omits the Battle of Opis, in which Cyrus's forces defeated and apparently massacred Nabonidus's army. Nor does it explain a two-week gap reported by the Nabonidus Chronicle between the Persian entry into Babylon and the surrender of the Esagila temple. Lisbeth S. Fried suggests {{that there may have been}} a siege or stand-off between the Persians and the temple's defenders and priests, about whose fate the Cylinder and Chronicle makes no mention. She speculates that they were killed or expelled by the Persians and replaced by more pro-Persian members of the Babylonian priestly elite. As Walton and Hill put it, the claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by the people is [...] "standard conqueror's rhetoric and may obscure other facts." [...] Describing the claim of one's own armies being welcomed as liberators as [...] "one of the great imperial fantasies", Bruce Lincoln, Professor of Divinity at the University of Chicago, notes that the Babylonian population repeatedly revolted against Persian rule in 522 BC, 521 BC, 484 BC and 482 BC (though not against Cyrus or his son Cambeses). The rebels sought to restore national independence and the line of native Babylonian kings – perhaps an indication that they were not as favourably disposed towards the Persians as the Cylinder suggests.|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter and {{journalist}} Richard David Boyle, who {{described himself as}} a former political ally of Milk's, stated that the film made a creditable effort at recreating the era. He also wrote that Penn captured Milk's [...] "smile and humanity", and his sense of humor about his homosexuality. Boyle reserved criticism for what he felt was the film's inability to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> of Milk's election and demise.|$|E

5000|$|A {{painting}} is often divided into several distinct sections (or [...] "feature blocks") {{by a series}} of dividing lines.

Khánh claimed that [...] "After the November coup, there was much relaxation, wining and dining, and little {{prosecution}} of the war effort." [...] He claimed he had built up intelligence infrastructure to weed out the Việt Cộng under Diệm's rule, but that the other generals had disbanded it and released communist prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Although Shilts was applauded for {{bringing}} public attention {{to bear on}} gay civil-rights issues and the AIDS crisis, he was also harshly criticized (and spat upon on Castro Street) by some in the gay community for calling for the closure of gay bathhouses in San Francisco to slow the spread of AIDS. Shilts maintained his sense of integrity in spite of being called [...] "a traitor to his own kind" [...] by a fellow Bay Area journalist. In a note included in The Life and Times of Harvey Milk, Shilts expressed his view of a reporter's duty to rise above criticism: I can only answer that I tried {{to tell the truth}} and, if not be objective, at least be fair; history is not served when reporters prize trepidation and propriety over the robust journalistic duty to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
