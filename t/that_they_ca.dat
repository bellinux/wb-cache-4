40|$|This paper {{presents}} an electron microprobe study of inclusions within igneous zircons from ca. 3800 Ma metatonalite sample G 97 / 18. Crystalline inclusions are K-feldspar. plagioclase, quartz, hornblende, biotite, ilmenite and apatite. Additionally, one globular polymineralic inclusion interpreted as crystallised melt {{occurs at the}} surface of a polished grain mount. This consists of plagioclase + quartz + K-feldspar around a biotite lath. Other similar, but rare globular inclusions were seen buried within other zircons below the polished surface. These inclusions, particularly the presence of K-feldspar and plagioclase in broadly equal amounts, entail crystallisation of the zircons from a (residual) granitic (sensu-stricto) melt rather than a tonalitic melt. SHRIMP (Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe) U/Pb dating of zircons with inclusions indicates <b>that</b> <b>they</b> grew at <b>ca.</b> 3800 Ma (the accepted igneous age of the rock). This inclusion suite is compatible with the low Ti-in-zircon temperatures for G 97 / 18 igneous zircon (Hiess et al., 2008). Therefore, low Ti-in-zircon temperatures and 2 ̆ 2 granitic 2 ̆ 2 inclusions found in Hadean detrital zircons do not necessitate crystallisation from low temperature granites, because such features would also be found if Hadean zircons had crystallised (late) from higher temperature zircon-undersaturated melts of tonalitic composition.

For instance, the Take The Best heuristic uses validity order for cues, which requires considerable computation, potentially undermining the computational advantages of the simple decision mechanism. But many cue orders can achieve good decision performance, and studies of sequential search for data records have proposed a number of simple ordering rules that may be of use in constructing appropriate decision cue orders as well.

On the day of birth (P 0), cortical neurones generated widespread, highly synchronous [Ca 2 +]i transients over large areas. On average, 52 % of neurones participated in these transients, and in 20 % of slices, an average of 80 % participated. These transients were blocked by TTX and nifedipine, indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> resulted from <b>Ca</b> 2 + influx during electrical activity, and occurred at a mean frequency of 0. 91 min− 1. The occurrence of this activity was highly centred at P 0 : at E 16 and P 2 an average of only 15 % and 24 % of neurones, respectively, participated in synchronous transients, and they occurred at much lower frequencies at both E 16 and P 2 than at P 0. The overall frequency of [Ca 2 +]i transients in individual cells did not change between E 16 and P 2, just the degree of their synchronicity. The onset of this spontaneous, synchronous activity correlated with a large increase in Na+ current density that occurred just before P 0, and its cessation with a large decrease in resting resistance that occurred just after P 2. This widespread, synchronous activity may serve a variety of functions in the neonatal nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Telehealth is an {{important}} issue in the medical and healthcare domains. Although a number of systems have been developed {{to meet the demands of}} emerging telehealth services, the following problems still remain to be addressed: (1) most systems do not monitor/predict the vital signs states so that they are able to send alarms to caregivers in real-time; (2) most systems do not focus on reducing the amount of work that caregivers need to do, and provide patients with remote care; and (3) most systems do not recommend guidelines for caregivers. This study thus proposes a framework for a real-time and Continua-based Care Guideline Recommendation System (Cagurs) which utilizes mobile device platforms to provide caregivers of chronic patients with real-time care guideline recommendations, and that enables vital signs data to be transmitted between different devices automatically, using the Continua standard. Moreover, the proposed system adopts the episode mining approach to monitor/predict anomalous conditions of patients, and then offers related recommended care guidelines to caregivers so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E
40|$|Computational {{workflows}} are {{a powerful}} paradigm to represent and manage complex applications, particularly in large-scale distributed scientific data analysis. Workflows represent application components {{that result in}} individual computations {{as well as their}} interdependencies in terms of data flow. Workflow systems use these representations to manage various aspects of workflow creation and execution for users, such as the automatic assignment of execution resources. This paper describes an approach to automating a new aspect of the process: the selection of application components and data sources. We present a novel approach that enables users to specify varying degrees of detail and amount of constraints in a workflow request, including the specification of constraints on input, intermediate, or output data in the workflow, abstract workflow component classes rather than specific component implementations, and generic reusable workflow templates that express a pre-defined combination of components. The algorithm elaborates the user request into a set of fully ground workflows with specific choices of data sources and codes to be used so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

As I have argued at length elsewhere (see Lazonick 1991, 2003, and 2005), an analysis of the economic development of nations requires a theory of innovative enterprise. Innovation, defined as the generation of higher quality, lower cost products than were previously available at prevailing factor prices, is the foundation of economic development. Notwithstanding the role of the state in allocating resources to investments that generate new knowledge, a modern economy ultimately relies on business enterprises to generate innovation (Lazonick 2005). What do business enterprises do? Business enterprises engage in three generic activities: strategy, organization, and finance. By engaging in strategy, a business enterprise chooses the products it want to produce and the processes by which it will produce them. By engaging in organization a business enterprise develops and utilizes productive resources with the goal of generating products that buyers want at prices <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|The antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) on effector T lymphocytes {{has been characterized}} as an a # chain heterodimer {{that is associated with}} the CD 3 (T 3) complex on the cell surface (1). Recently, a second CD 3 -associated heterodimer, composed of a y gene product and a putative S gene product, has been identified on a subset of human lymphocytes (2, 3) human thymocytes (4), and murine thymocytes (5). Because # and y chain mRNA, in contrast to a chain mRNA transcripts, are abundant in immature murine thymocytes (6, 7) it was hypothesized that such thymocytes could express #y receptors that are replaced by a # receptors after translation of a chain mRNA (6, 7). However, no evidence exists that # and y protein can be synthesized by a single cell. In this report we show that the human T cell line PEER, which expresses a CD 3 associated TCR y chain on the cell surface (8, 9), synthesizes a 38 kD 0 chain product that associates intracellularly with CD 3. However, this CD 3 -TCR # complex is not found on the cell surface, presumably because no a chain protein can be synthesized (8).

The Teachers as Leaders program of the Mountain Brook, Alabama Schools represents that shift and is empowering teachers to utilize their leadership skills {{and contribute to the}} system as it fulfills its mission to offer education to its students that is effective, challenging, and engaging. The Mountain Brook Schools established the Teachers as Leaders program in order to develop a culture of continuity in leadership as many administrator retirements were predicted for the near future. The program, however, was not designed as a “Teachers as Future Administrators ” program. Rather, it was an intentional plan to prepare teachers for continued leadership, whether that is demonstrated in their classrooms or in administrative roles. The school system partnered with private consultants, a restaurant business, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham to deliver the Teachers as Leaders program.

Introduction How is reality out there represented in our heads? Does cognition work with information from the outside world? Is our thinking exclusively determined by the world, is it exposed to perturbations from an apparently endless environment, or does cognition actively generate and construct the world?

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{disturbances}} {{of active}} forms of vitamin D synthesis and disturbances in calcium and posphate metabolism develop early in {{chronic renal failure}}, when creatinine clearance is about 30 ml/min. Chronic hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis only partially correct the biochemical environment of patients on chronic renal replacement therapy because of end-stage renal disease. These dialysis modalities can’t significantly affect the endocrine disturbances of chronic renal failure and they have minimal modulatory effect. The management of disturbed calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) metabolism and the maintainance of Ca × P product below 4. 4 mmol/l thanks {{to the use of}} dialysate solutions with the appropriate calcium concentration and the careful dosage of phosphate binders, calcium and active vitamin D metabolits, are extremely important for the prevention of renal osteodystrophy, secondary hyperparathyroidism as well as low-bone turnover disease. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the plasma levels of calcium, phosphate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and parathormon (PTH) in 58 patients who were treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) from March to August 2003. The use of phosphate binders and the substitution with active vitamin D metabolits were also analyzed. Methods. We examined 58 patients, 30 males and 28 female, mean-age 52 years (range, 26 - 78 years), affected by end-stage renal disease of the different leading cause. The average time on peritoneal dialysis program was 20 months (2 - 66 months). Most of the patients were treated by CAPD, while only few of them performed automatic, cyclic or intermittent peritoneal dialysis. Most of the patients used a dialysate with 1. 75 mmol/l calcium concentration. Results. The study showed that our patients on chronic CAPD program during several months had normal calcemia, phosphatemia and the level of alkaline phosphatase, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had <b>Ca</b> × P product in the recommended range.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{diagnosis}} of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility by in vitro contraction testing can often only be performed at specialized laboratories {{far away from}} where patients live. Therefore, we have designed a protocol for genetic screening of the RYR 1 -cDNA and for functional testing of newly identified ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR 1) gene variants in B lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood samples drawn at local primary care centers. METHODS: B lymphocytes were isolated for the extraction of RYR 1 -mRNA and genomic DNA and for establishment of lymphoblastoid B cell lines in 5 patients carrying yet unclassified mutations in the RYR 1. The B lymphoblastoid cell lines were used to study resting cytoplasmic calcium concentration, the peak calcium transient induced by the sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, and the dose-dependent calcium release induced by the ryanodine receptor agonist 4 -chloro-m-cresol. RESULTS: It was possible to extract mRNA for cDNA synthesis and to create B lymphocyte clones from all samples. All B lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying RYR 1 candidate mutations showed significantly increased resting cytoplasmic calcium levels {{as well as a}} shift to lower concentrations of 4 -chloro-m-cresol inducing calcium release compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood samples are stable regarding RNA and DNA extraction and establishment of lymphoblastoid B cell lines after transportation at ambient temperature over large distances by ordinary mail. Functional tests on B cells harboring the newly identified amino acid substitutions indicate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> alter intracellular <b>Ca</b> 2 + homeostasis and are most likely causative of malignant hyperthermia.
