The work constitutes a demonstration of two rotor engine system technology, utilizing upgraded and refined component technologies derived from prior NASA Contracts NAS 3 - 25945, NAS 3 - 24628 and NAS- 23056. Technical objectives included definition of, procurement and assembly of an advanced two rotor core aircraft engine, operation with Jet-A fuel at <b>Take-Off</b> <b>rating</b> of 340 BHP (254 kW) and operation at a maximum cruise condition of 255 BHP (190 kW), 75 % cruise. A fuel consumption objective of 0. 435 LBS/BHP-Hr (265 GRS/kW-Hr) was identified for the maximum cruise condition. A critical technology component item, a high speed, unit injector fuel injection system with electronic control was defined, procured and tested in conjunction with this effort. The two rotor engine configuration established herein defines an affordable, advanced, Jet-A fuel capability core engine (not including reduction gear, propeller shaft and some aircraft accessories) for General Aviation of the mid- 1990 's and beyond...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{the basic}} {{reproductive}} ratio R 0 of dengue fever {{has continued to}} be an ever-increasing challenge among epidemiologists. In this paper we propose two different constructions to estimate R 0 which is derived from a dynamical system of host-vector dengue transmission model. The construction {{is based on the}} original assumption that in the early states of an epidemic the infected human compartment increases exponentially {{at the same rate as}} the infected mosquito compartment (previous work). In the first proposed construction, we modify previous works by assuming that the rates of infection for mosquito and human compartments might be different. In the second construction, we add an improvement by including more realistic conditions in which the dynamics of an infected human compartments are intervened by the dynamics of an infected mosquito compartment, and vice versa. We apply our construction to the real dengue epidemic data from SB Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, during the period of outbreak Nov. 25, 2008 –Dec. 2012. We also propose two scenarios to determine the <b>take-off</b> <b>rate</b> of infection at the beginning of a dengue epidemic for construction of the estimates of R 0 : scenario I from equation of new cases of dengue with respect to time (daily) and scenario II from equation of new cases of dengue with respect to cumulative number of new cases of dengue. The results show that our first construction of R 0 accommodates the <b>take-off</b> <b>rate</b> differences between mosquitoes and humans. Our second construction of the R 0 estimation takes into account the presence of infective mosquitoes in the early growth rate of infective humans and vice versa. We conclude that the second approach is more realistic, compared with our first approach and the previous work...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the conditions of engine operation causing the most severe thermal stresses in the hot parts of a turbojet engine, a J 47 - 25 engine was instrumented with thermocouples and operated to obtain engine material temperatures under steady-state and transient conditions. Temperatures measured during <b>rated</b> <b>take-off</b> conditions of nozzle guide vanes downstream of a single combustor differed on the order of 400 degrees F depending on the relation of the blades position to the highest temperature zone of the burner.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The {{study examined}} the behavioural factors that influence variation in foraging costs of wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans Linnaeus) during two consecutive years. This was performed by measuring simultaneously foraging activities and metabolic rates (W kg – 1) of breeding birds during the incubation periods of 1998 and 1999. 2. A total of 38 birds (19 in each year) were injected with doubly labelled water, equipped with satellite transmitters to measure foraging distance and flight speed, and equipped with activity recorders to measure landings and take-offs from the water surface. 3. In 1999, birds spent on average 30 % more time at sea (11 · 07 ± 3 · 53 SD, days), travelled 43 % further (5473 ± 2348 SD, km) and {{increased the number of}} landings and take-offs per day by 66 % (28 · 1 ± 11 · 4 SD, landings per day) compared to 1998. 4. Energy expenditure rates during foraging were significantly higher in 1999 (5 · 3 ± 0 · 8 SD, W kg – 1, n = 8) compared to 1998 (4 · 5 ± 0 · 5 SD, W kg – 1, n = 11). 5. Landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>rates</b> explained the greatest proportion of variation in energy expenditure rates of wandering albatrosses, rather than total distance travelled, flight speed or time in flight. 6. Despite 18 % higher foraging costs in 1999, the daily rate of food intake was similar between years, suggesting that energy acquisition per unit effort was lower. 7. The energetic cost of flight for wandering albatrosses was estimated to fall between 3 · 4 and 5 · 1 W kg - 1, or 1 · 4 – 2 · 0 ´ measured BMR, one of the lowest flight cost yet reported for any seabird...|$|R

40|$|Using similar {{assumptions}} {{to those}} adopted in a companion paper (1) for tray column analysis, a parametric transfer-function (T. F. M.) is here derived completely analytically for packed, binary distillation columns. For simplicity, {{the method of}} calculation is illustrated for a column that is symmetrical statically and dynamically i. e. having a rectifier vapour/stripping section liquid capacitance ration c= 1. 0. This produces a completely diagonal T. F. M. between the sum and output composition changes and the circulating and product <b>take-off</b> flow <b>rates.</b> The T. F. M. is also presented for c= 1. 0 and although no longer diagonal at all frequencies, analysis and simulation show that the column behaviour is not greatly affected by changes in this parameter. Long packed columns are shown to produce novel nonminimum phase effects when twin product control is attempted, whereas, serious travelling-wave phenomena can limit controller performance in short columns. The possibility of zero separation-gain is also revealed. The computed shapes of inverse Nyquist loci are confirmed by analysis and by numerical time-domain simulation. The chief cause of discrepancy between tray and packed column behaviour is shown to result from the continuous equilibrium assumption for theoretical trays...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The causal {{mechanism}} of the chronic sports injury patellar tendinopathy is not well understood. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare ankle and knee joint dynamics during the performance of the volleyball spike jump between healthy volleyball players (n = 8) and asymptomatic volleyball players with previous patellar tendinopathy (n = 7). Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Inverse dynamics were used to estimate ankle and knee joint dynamics. From these multiple biomechanical variables, a logistic regression was performed to estimate the probability of the presence or absence of previous patellar tendinopathy among the volleyball players studied. Results: Several biomechanical variables improved the prediction of the presence or absence of previous patellar tendinopathy. For landing, ankle plantar flexion at the time of touch-down, and knee range of motion during the first part of impact, and for <b>take-off,</b> loading <b>rate</b> of the knee extensor moment during the eccentric countermovement phase of take-off were predictive. As interaction effects, the presence or absence of previous patellar tendinopathy were correctly predicted by ankle and knee range of motion during the first part of impact, by loading rate of the knee extensor moment during the eccentric phases of take-off and landing, and by knee angular velocity during the eccentric phases of take-off and landing. Conclusion: Smaller joint flexion during the first part of landing impact, and higher rate of knee moment development during the eccentric phases of the spike-jump landing sequence, together with higher knee angular velocities, might be risk factors in the development of patellar tendinopathy in volleyball players...|$|R
40|$|Casual field {{observation}} {{reveals that}} flight ability declines with increasing body size in birds and other flying animals, {{and it is}} generally expected that this trend will explain aspects of the ecology and evolution of flight. For example, within the Anseriformes, teal (Anas spp.) take off vertically while swans (Cygnus spp.) take off in a laboured manner, with a shallow initial angle of ascent. Since teal require less room than swans for take-off, teal may utilize smaller ponds with less open surface area. Some empirical data are consistent with these casual observations. Maximum acceleration during <b>take-off</b> or <b>rates</b> of vertical ascent are reported to decline with increasing body mass in small passerines (DeJong, 1983), aerial insectivores (Warrick, 1998) and doves and pigeons (Columbiformes; Seveyka, 1999). The percentage of time spent bounding in flap-bounding flight decreases with increasing body mass in woodpeckers (Picidae; Tobalske, 1996). What aspects of animal design can explain these trends? One explanation {{for this is that}} the maximum mechanical power available from the flight muscles may be limited by wingbeat frequency (Pennycuick, 1975). In this line of reasoning, muscle strain (e, the change in muscle length relative to resting length) and stress (s, the force per unit cross-sectional area) are assumed to be independent of body mass. Mass-specific work, defined as e·s /(density of muscle), is therefore assumed to be independent of mass, and mass-specific power is expected to scale in proportion to the frequency of cycles of limb movement. In birds, during maximal effort such as during take-off, wingbeat frequency is predicted to scale in proportion to m- 0. 33, where m is body mass (Pennycuick, 1992), so the maximum mass-specific power available is expected to be proportional to m- 0. 33. It is assumed that the mass-specific power required for flight at comparable velocities (i. e. not the same velocity) in birds or any flying objects of similar shape scales in proportion to m 0. 1...|$|R
