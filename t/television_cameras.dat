5|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was refurbished by Metronet during 2005 and 2006. Works included provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the visually impaired, installation of closed-circuit <b>television</b> <b>cameras,</b> passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. The station does not have step free access from the platforms to the street.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of sufficiently small and light cameras with a timer mechanism, {{and the training}} and handling of the birds to carry the necessary loads, presented major challenges, as did the limited control over the pigeons' position, orientation and speed when the photographs were being taken. In 2004, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used miniature <b>television</b> <b>cameras</b> attached to falcons and goshawks to obtain live footage, and today some researchers, enthusiasts and artists similarly deploy crittercams with various species of animals.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit <b>television</b> <b>cameras,</b> a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1990, England played West Germany in a World Cup semi-final {{match at}} Juventus's Stadio delle Alpi in Turin. Gascoigne, having already {{received}} a yellow card during England's 1–0 victory over Belgium {{in the second}} round, was booked for a foul on Thomas Berthold, which meant {{that he would be}} suspended for the final if England won the match. <b>Television</b> <b>cameras</b> showed that he had tears in his eyes following the yellow card and made Gascoigne a highly popular figure with the sympathetic British public. The match culminated in a penalty shoot-out, which the Germans won after Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed their penalties.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place {{all day on}} Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then {{transmitted}} live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot {{before and during the}} rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It {{was one of the last}} major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest <b>television</b> <b>cameras,</b> the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|E

5|$|Many stations, {{including}} WIAT, WBMA/WCFT/WJSU, WTVY (channel 4) in Dothan and WSFA (channel 12) in Montgomery, showed <b>television</b> <b>cameras</b> {{capturing the}} event as the tornado moved east-northeast across {{the western and}} northern suburbs of Birmingham around 6:00p.m. CDT (2300 UTC). Several suburbs in the area were severely damaged by the massive tornado as it tore through {{the west side of}} Birmingham, resulting in multiple fatalities. The suburbs of Concord, Pleasant Grove, and McDonald Chapel were devastated by the tornado as it moved northeast, flattening entire neighborhoods. As the tornado entered the Birmingham city limits, it devastated the Pratt City neighborhood, destroying numerous homes and apartment buildings. The tornado then struck the suburb of Fultondale, causing EF2 damage to homes and businesses before dissipating east of Fultondale. Surveys indicated high-end EF4 damage from the tornado in Birmingham's western suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} {{stage on}} which Jarre and his musicians performed {{was built on}} top of four large barges. Large purpose-built display screens were built, {{and one of the}} buildings {{to be used as a}} backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that <b>television</b> <b>cameras</b> were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.|$|E

With a three-point lead, Fischer was content to inch towards the title, and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate. The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (Fischer had objected {{to what he said}} were noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly– they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants– removed the <b>television</b> <b>cameras),</b> a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, three rows were cleared), and Soviet claims that Fischer was using electronic and chemical devices to 'control' Spassky, resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall.|$|E

5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four <b>television</b> <b>cameras,</b> a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E
