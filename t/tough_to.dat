5|$|As {{leaders in}} the punk rock scene, the Ramones' music has usually been {{identified}} with that label, while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop. In the 1980s, the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory, as can be heard on Too <b>Tough</b> <b>to</b> Die.|$|E
5|$|Ginobili is {{credited}} with being a team player, over his personal performance, such as his accepting the Spurs' coaches decision of playing off the bench rather than being a starter. He is also known for his <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> defend passes such as the no-look pass and the pick-and-roll.|$|E
5|$|Too <b>Tough</b> <b>to</b> Die {{was also}} the first of three studio albums that were {{licensed}} from Sire Records to the independent record label Beggars Banquet Records for release in the UK. The deal saw the group's work promoted better and resulted placings on the UK album and singles charts. The group had not charted in the UK since 1980's End of the Century.|$|E

5|$|Previous Ramones records {{featured}} celebrity record {{producers in}} an attempt to gain some sort of popularity. Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting, Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978's Road to Ruin: Ed Stasium and ex-band member Tommy Ramone. Too <b>Tough</b> <b>to</b> Die has less production value than previous recordings by the Ramones. Because critics often disapproved of the sound quality on End of the Century and Pleasant Dreams, the band leaned towards a harsher sound.|$|E
5|$|Punk bands such as Screeching Weasel, the Vindictives, the Queers, Parasites, the Mr. T Experience, Boris the Sprinkler, Beatnik Termites, Tip Toppers, Jon Cougar Concentration Camp, McRackins, and Kobanes have {{recorded}} cover versions of entire Ramones albums—Ramones, Leave Home, Rocket to Russia, It's Alive, Road to Ruin, End of the Century, Pleasant Dreams, Subterranean Jungle, {{two versions of}} Too <b>Tough</b> <b>to</b> Die, and Halfway To Sanity respectively. The Huntingtons' File Under Ramones consists of Ramones covers from across the band's history.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
50|$|The red {{artifact}} is {{the essence}} of Chattur'gha. Chattur'gha aligned monsters are <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> represent their affinity for physical power, and most deal more damage and have more health. Thus making the Chattur'gha alignment an unofficial hard mode.|$|R

5000|$|In Challenging Stage, {{there are}} more varied formations. Also, the screen tilts, rotates, and zooms in and out, giving an {{illusion}} <b>to</b> make it <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> secure a lock on the Galagans. The Galagans do not really follow along with the tilting.|$|R
25|$|Too <b>Tough</b> <b>to</b> Care is an 18-minute {{educational}} film produced in 1964 to undermine teenage resistance to anti-smoking education. Unlike other films in its genre, Too <b>Tough</b> <b>to</b> Care used satire and humor {{to illustrate the}} misleading claims of cigarette advertising. The film garnered attention in both the mainstream press as well as academic journals.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} skill levels to Assassin, Rookie, Arcade and Ultimate. As well as {{changing}} the difficulty, each level unlocks {{more of the}} game than the level that is easier than it. The enemies are <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> defeat in the higher levels, {{but there are more}} rewards.|$|R

25|$|The Qin army led {{a direct}} {{invasion}} into Wei by besieging its capital Daliang but {{soon realized that}} the city walls were too <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> break into. They devised a new strategy in which they utilized {{the power of a}} local river that was linked to the Yellow River. The river was used to flood the city's walls, causing massive devastation to the city. Upon realizing the situation, King Jia of Wei hurriedly came out of the capital and surrendered it to the Qin army in order to avoid further bloodshed of his people.|$|E
50|$|The French {{attacked}} the Ottoman positions and quickly {{broke through the}} first defensive line before it was fully completed. The second line, however, proved <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> defeat and the French withdrew for a while. At this point, cavalry general Murat saw his opportunity and attacked with his cavalry, quickly routing the exposed Turks.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1940's, as Nick Abelman {{approached}} {{the age of}} seventy, he admitted it was becoming <b>tougher</b> and <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> make the trek from Reno to Tahoe every day, and his manager, Pavlovich was too sick to handle the club alone. The three partners conferred and agreed {{it was time to}} sell.|$|R
5000|$|Closed {{questions}} {{should not}} be interpreted as simple question which anyone can answer quickly with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’. It could be <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> make one think before responding. For example; ‘when two quantities are dependent on each other, does an increase in one always leads {{to an increase in}} the other?’ ...|$|R
25|$|However, since Taylor's {{win over}} Priestley in the 1995 World Matchplay final, Taylor has only lost once in all {{competitions}} and hasn't been beaten on television by Priestley since 1995. Taylor and Priestley remain great friends, and Taylor has claimed Priestley {{is the toughest}} opponent he has faced. At the 2009 Las Vegas championship Taylor was emotional when he beat Dennis Priestley 8–0 in the second round. He later said it was <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> beat such a great friend that way. The pair have met on 44 occasions which include Taylor winning 37, Priestley winning 6, with 1 draw.|$|E
25|$|McNabb {{requested}} and {{was granted}} {{his release from}} the team on December 1, 2011, with a reported interest in joining the Houston Texans, Kansas City Chiefs or his hometown Chicago Bears, all three of whom had lost their starting quarterbacks for the season to injury but were still making playoff pushes. While the Texans and Chiefs had signed Jake Delhomme and Kyle Orton, respectively, prior to McNabb becoming a free agent, the Bears had not signed anyone and expressed interest in adding McNabb. It was ultimately {{decided that it was}} too late to add a free agent quarterback for the playoff hunt, as it would be <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> grasp their offense in the short period of time. The Bears subsequently signed Josh McCown.|$|E
25|$|The careful {{methods of}} PAVN forces are {{illustrated}} in the successful attack against the US Air Force's TACAN radar navigation facility in Laos (Lima Site 85), in March 1968. Situated on a mountain peak that was considered too <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> assault, the facilities were manned by a small force of USAF technicians on top, and about 1,000 Hmong and Thai irregulars deployed further down the slopes. NVA commandos however successfully climbed the mountain, killing or dispersing most of the guards and US airmen at the peak, while a larger follow-on echelon of NVA and Pathet Lao assaulted {{the rest of the}} mountain slopes below. The outgunned and outnumbered Hmong and Thai irregulars were defeated, and Communist forces held the site despite several days under counterattack by US aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Dungeon Levels become {{progressively}} more challenging as the player descends, with tougher monsters and traps. Most levels are randomly generated as the player reaches them, {{though there are}} certain pre-created levels as well, referred to as Legendary Lands. These areas are often <b>tougher</b> <b>to</b> survive than other levels, but also usually carry greater reward.|$|R
