The study included optimum frequency and amplitude to obtain maximum fruit removal percentage, harvesting rate of the shaker. Harvesting rate was calculated by weighing both the harvested and unharvested almonds. In the tests the limbs of trees were shaken at 40 and 50 mm amplitude of the connecting rod attached to the crankshaft and 10, 15, 20 Hz frequencies. The results were analysed according to the maximum fruit removal percentage. Shaking time was 10 s {{for all of the}} frequency and amplitude tests. Maximum fruit removal (97 and 100 %) was achieved by operating the shaker at amplitude of 50 mm and a frequency of 15 and 20 Hz. Therefore it can be suggested an amplitude of 50 mm and a frequency of 20 Hz for mechanical harvesting of almond. Moreover, the appropriate harvesting time for nonpearl variety of almond was found the second week of August. Because, the ratio of Fruit Detachament Force (FDF) to Weight (W) at different maturity times was found 1. 8 N/g at the second week of August...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> {{products}} in Europe and North America, the dominant organic food markets, has spurred increases in organic area and production globally. From 2008 – 2013, {{the area of}} production grew 109 %, 42 %, and 53 % for organic temperate <b>tree</b> <b>fruits,</b> citrus, and tropical/subtropical fruits, respectively, with much lower growth for total area (non-organic plus organic) in these categories. Most organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> represent approximately 1 – 2 % of total production area for a specific fruit; avocado is the exception, with 8 % of avocado area worldwide under organic management. Mexico, Italy, and China are the top three countries in terms of organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> area, but not all countries segregate <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> crops in the organic statistics they report. Organic standards are not identical among countries, although over 90 % of organic sales are in the USA and EU where standards are harmonized. Published data on the relative yield of organic to conventional <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> are scarce and range from 42 % to 126 % of conventional yields. Reported production costs for organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> were generally higher than conventional, with higher cost for fertilizers a frequent reason. Higher selling prices for organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> were able to compensate for lower yields and higher costs in most cases, leading to a higher net return under certified organic management.

" The abstract for the latter notes: Organic certification of <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> in Washington State began in 1988 with the establishment of the Organic Food Program (OFP) in the Washington State Dept. of Agriculture. We have been compiling statistical data on the organic sector in the state using their data (Granatstein and Dauer, 2000; Granatstein and Kirby, 2002). Our goal is to produce an annual update of organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> acreage in the state to provide growers and the industry with current information on these crops to aid in their business decisions. Modest changes in production acres can have significant impacts on the marketplace, and thus current information is essential. Also, our reporting provides a level of detail not available elsewhere, and knowing the trend by variety, for example, Red Delicious versus Gala, is critical, while data for generic ‘organic apples’ will be minimally useful for working in the fresh pack arena.

40|$|Objectives Shea tree is a {{multi-purpose}} tree daily used by rural African communities. Economic {{importance of}} Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> {{has been rising}} and achieving a great success in African, American and European markets. Shea butter is used mainly in chocolate industry, cosmetic or pharmacological products. Traceability {{is now one of}} the great concerns of the customers and the lawyers. In view of the difficulties of installing these documentary systems in developing country particularly the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the new strategies of traceability emerge. Methods Molecular technique using 28 S rDNA profiles generated by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to detect the variation in fungal community structures of Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> from Senegal, Mali and Cameroon. Results 28 S rDNA profiles were analysed by multivariate analysis, distinct microbial communities were detected. Band profiles of Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> fungi from different countries were specific for each location and could be used as a bar code to discriminate the origin of fruits. Conclusion We propose the polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method as the fingerprinting of Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> using 28 S rDNA of fungi that provides the fruits with a unique bar code and make it possible to trace back the Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> to their original locations.

40|$|Organic food {{sales in}} the U. S. and other coun-tries {{continue}} to grow at an estimated 20 to 25 % per year. This has occurred for the past 10 years and {{shows no sign of}} abating (Fig. 1). The Organic Trade Association estimates that U. S. sales will grow to $ 20 billion by the year 2005. It is less clear where organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> sits relative to the overall sector growth, as no statis-tics are readily available. Thus, we can only guess whether consumption of organic apples, for example, is above or below the overall growth rate. However, a 2001 survey by The Packer (2002) found that organic apples were the most frequent produce choice of organic consumers. The acreage of organic production in Wash-ington State also continues to expand in response to market growth. The major crop groups are list-ed in Table 1. <b>Tree</b> <b>fruit</b> accounts for about 25 % of the certified land and shows much more growth potential than other crops based on the transition acres.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Horticulture, Washington State UniversityMost rosaceous <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> {{have long}} juvenility and large plant sizes, which makes {{traditional}} seedling selection (TSS), relying on phenotypic evaluation alone, time-consuming and expensive. Marker-assisted seedling selection (MASS) uses DNA markers {{to provide an}} early DNA-based evaluation of genetic potential of seedlings. A major challenge in conducting MASS for rosaceous <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> {{is a lack of}} knowledge of estimating relative efficiency of various MASS strategies compared to TSS. To overcome this challenge and help facilitate successful MASS in rosaceous <b>tree</b> <b>fruit,</b> this study evaluates key elements of MASS efficiency both theoretically and empirically. This study provides an assessment of the current applications, challenges, and perspectives of MASS in Rosaceae <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> breeding, investigates genetic gain from alternative seedling selection strategies through analytical derivation and stochastic simulation modelling, provides software tools to estimate the cost of using MASS, and evaluates the efficiency of applying a DNA test for apple acidity, crispness, and firmness in an apple seedling population. Theoretical evaluation of genetic gain suggests that marker-based strategies tends to achieve higher genetic gain than TSS for a trait where the proportion of genotypic variance explained by marker information is greater than the broad-sense heritability. The cost modeling pipeline and decision support tool provide a solution to streamlining cost estimation for complex MASS schemes. Empirical analysis shows applying DNA tests for apple acidity, crispness, and firmness in an apple seedling population achieved similar genetic gain and up to 13 % cost savings compared to TSS, if genotyping costs are under $ 2 per sample. Results from this study provide rosaceous <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> breeders, for the first time, both guidance and tools for designing efficient MASS schemes.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three studies about <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> marketing and trade. The first study derives an implicit cost system based on LaFrance and Pope demand system with an empirical application for <b>tree</b> <b>fruit.</b> The economic and econometric approach improves preciseness and accuracy of elasticities for policy analysis. The demand system is estimated using iterative seemingly unrelated regression and tree fruitgeneralized method of moments with autocorrelation corrections. Elasticities are estimated for fresh and processed <b>tree</b> <b>fruit.</b> Findings indicate that implicit cost system outperformed the Translog system. Also, we conclude that increased U. S. exports drove up the farm level demand and grower prices for fresh <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> from 1980 to 2009. The second study presents an intertemporal economic model to estimate economic impacts of a single <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> pest and disease outbreak. The model is designed to examine the economic consequences of pest and disease outbreak on demand and supply with international trade. Our approach {{is to use a}} dynamic simulation of the single <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> industry under scenarios with and without outbreak to compare the stream of simulated outcomes and the consequences for measures of economic welfare of producers in the industry and consumers. An empirical application of hypothetical fire blight outbreak in the U. S. pear industry is conducted. The third study analyzes the effectiveness of advertising and promotional activities conducted by the Pear Bureau Northwest (PBN) on fresh pears during 2007 / 08 to 2011 / 12 crop marketing seasons using a nonparametric estimation method. The main results of this study show a predominately positive and significant role of advertising expenditures in promoting all winter pears and D'Anjou pears demand and in gaining positive marginal net returns to pear growers. However, the advertising effectiveness shows interregional disparity and varies promotional types and pear varieties. This study also found domestic demand for all winter pears and D'Anjou pears was significantly related to a number of other factors. We find that prices are more sensitive during economic recession than previously reported. School of Economic Sciences, Washington State Universit...|$|R
