40|$|Reliability of {{machining}} systems depends to a {{great extent}} on the reliability of cutting tool performance with the latter being the weak link due to wear. Soil processing systems have many in common with machining systems and a major problem related to use of tillage equipment is ploughshare wear as it markedly affects tillage quality and agricultural production economy. In the present study a machining and a soil processing example will be given for the determination and modelling of the reliability function R(T) : for turning of 20 CrMo 5 steel alloy using Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) and mixed ceramic cutting tools, and in a tillage operation using a straight <b>toothed</b> <b>harrow.</b> In the machining case, through comparative analysis of theoretical distribution models, which fit closer the experimental data, the Gaussian model is selected to represent the reliability function for both tool materials considered. In the tillage example, by carrying out an optimization procedure based upon the reliability function R(T) of the tillage system, a particular tool tooth geometry was found that establishes the maximum tooth working time possible for a reliable performance.

The objective of the research was to evaluate the adaptability of introduced perennial legumes and grass pastures in a semi-arid environment. Four introduced perennial pasture species; namely, Stylosanthes hamata, Macroptilium atropurpurium and Clitoria ternata (legumes) and Cenchrus ciliaris (grass), were studied. Two ploughing methods, viz, spring toothed cultivator and spiked <b>toothed</b> <b>harrow,</b> were used. A split-plot deign with three replications was applied. Ploughing methods were assigned to the main plots and the pasture species to the subplots. The plot size was 15 x 20 m. Data were collected on soil moisture percentage, using the gravimetric method, and plant growth parameters (plant density, survival rate and plant cover). Generally, ploughing methods and pasture species had no significant effect on soil moisture content, but pasture species had a significant effect on plant growth (plant density, survival rate and plant cover). Stylosanthes hamata in a pure stand and in a mixture with Cenchrus ciliaris was better in growth parameters than the other pasture species. Stylosanthes hamata and Cenchrus ciliaris were able to compete with the native plant species. The study indicated that there was no significant effect of ploughing methods on growth parameters, but the spring toothed cultivator gave better results in plant density, plant survival and plant cover...|$|E
