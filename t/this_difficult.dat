5|$|Dostoyevsky had to {{race against}} time, {{in order to}} finish on time both The Gambler and Crime and Punishment. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who would soon become his second wife, was a great help for Dostoyevsky during <b>this</b> <b>difficult</b> task.* Peace (2005), 8 The first part of Crime and Punishment {{appeared}} in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger, {{and the last one}} was published in December 1866.|$|E
5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made <b>this</b> <b>difficult.</b> On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. <b>This</b> <b>difficult</b> co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways {{to say the same}} thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce this show, to aid in the peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes <b>this</b> <b>difficult</b> to confirm.|$|E
5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from the Kingdom of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left <b>this</b> <b>difficult</b> decision to his successor.|$|E
5|$|However, Bruce {{soon became}} embroiled in the {{disputes}} over Churchill's autocratic leadership style and {{his lack of}} consultation with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. With the fear of Japanese invasion mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill {{on a number of}} occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in <b>this</b> <b>difficult</b> arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from John Curtin and the other dominion prime ministers.|$|E
