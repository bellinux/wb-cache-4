5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|Between 2004 and 2007, ground {{inflation}} {{began in}} the volcanic field, indicating <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> of a sill beneath it. The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as Uturunku in Bolivia and Yellowstone in the United States and {{has been accompanied by}} anomalies in soil gas emission and seismic activity. This pattern has created concern about the potential for impending large-scale eruptive activity.|$|E
5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E

In the Ulster Basin, UK, {{most of the}} authigenic mineralization in the Permo-Triassic sandstones pre-dated tertiary volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> <b>The</b> hydrothermal fluids and heat-flow from <b>the</b> volcanic <b>intrusions</b> did not affect quartz and feldspar overgrowths. However, clay mineral-transformation, illite-smectite to illite and chlorite was documented near <b>the</b> volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> Abundant actinolite, illite, chlorite, albite and laumontite cementation of the sand grains were also documented near <b>the</b> volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> <b>The</b> abundance of these cementing minerals decreases away from <b>the</b> volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> In <b>the</b> Hartford Basin, USA, the emplacement of <b>the</b> volcanic <b>intrusions</b> took place simultaneous with sedimentation. The heat-flow from <b>the</b> volcanic <b>intrusions</b> and hydrothermal activity related to the volcanics modified the texture of authigenic minerals. Microcrystalline mosaic albite and quartz developed rather than overgrowths and crystals near <b>the</b> <b>intrusions.</b> Chlorite clumps and masses were also documented with microcrystalline mosaic albite and quartz. These features are localized near <b>the</b> basaltic <b>intrusions.</b> Laumontite is also documented near <b>the</b> volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> <b>The</b> reservoir characteristics of the studied sandstone formations are highly affected by the volcanic and hydrothermal fluids in the Hartford and the Ulster Basin.

Mount Kinabalu is a massive granitic dome structure that is geologically young and formed from <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> and uplift of a granitic batholith. At 4095.2m, it {{is by far the}} tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of sandstone and shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive ultramafic (serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms a collar around the mountain. It is on these ultramafic soils that the flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of endemicity and many of the area's rarest species can be found here.|$|E

He was invalided back to Australia in August aboard HTBoorara, and given a hero's welcome on arrival in Melbourne. Found to be medically unfit for active service, McNamara was discharged from the Australian Flying Corps on 31 January 1918. Panic caused by <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> into Australian waters of the German raider Wolf resulted in him being recalled to the AFC and put in charge of an aerial reconnaissance unit based in South Gippsland, Victoria, flying a Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2B and later a Maurice Farman Shorthorn.

One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, Beryl quickly {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. It slowed {{due to the}} weakening ridge to its north, and an approaching cold front turned it {{to the north and}} northeast on May29. Despite being well inland, Beryl retained enough convection to remain a tropical cyclone. As Beryl approached the Atlantic Ocean on May30, its convection increased to the south and east of the center, although <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> of dry air resulted in a ragged appearance on satellite imagery. Based on reports from ships, Beryl was upgraded to a tropical storm on May30 near the South Carolina coastline. The approaching front caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. Beryl's circulation became elongated and its associated convection spread northward, suggesting the transition into an extratropical cyclone. By late on May30, Beryl became extratropical, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories. The storm continued to the northeast, later turning to the east-southeast. On June2, a larger extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of Beryl to the southeast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Late on July17, Ma-on {{underwent}} another eyewall replacement {{cycle and}} weakened, despite developing improved outflow and convection {{in the northern}} quadrant. The typhoon's large size prevented re-intensification– gale force winds extended 370km (200mi) east of the center. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> of dry air diminished thunderstorms in the western periphery. By July18, Ma-on reached the western extent of the ridge and began a motion to the north toward Japan. The next day, it turned to the northeast as it paralleled the Japan coastline just offshore. At around 1400UTC on July19, Ma-on made landfall on Shikoku as a minimal typhoon. Turning to the east, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over {{the southern tip of}} the Kii Peninsula early on July20. After emerging from the country, Ma-on turned to the southeast. Increased wind shear displaced the convection to the east, although slight re-intensification was expected. However, the JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July21 after the storm lost much of its convection. The circulation became ill-defined, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July22, noting the system {{was in the process of}} dissipation. However, the JMA maintained Ma-on as a severe tropical storm until July23, by which time the storm had turned to the northeast. The storm became extratropical on July24 near the Kuril Islands, lasting another seven days before dissipating east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by <b>the</b> <b>intrusion</b> prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed.
