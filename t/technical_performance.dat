5|$|The PS4 {{version of}} Leifthrasir {{received}} an aggregate score of 87/100 based on 49 reviews, becoming the 15th best-reviewed title of 2016. The Vita version received {{a score of}} 93/100 based on five reviews. Reviewing Leifthrasir, Famitsu praised the increased smoothness and battle frequency, noting that the title still felt fresh despite being the remake of a 2007 title. They also praised the graphical upgrade {{and its effect on}} the artwork. Critics generally agreed that Leifthrasir was an improvement on the original game, praising its <b>technical</b> <b>performance,</b> lack of the original's framerate problems, graphical upgrade, and redesigned gameplay systems. Despite this, reviewers noted that the game could get repetitive, with a few noting incumbent issues with its story presentation.|$|E

30|$|The {{choice of}} an ‘ideal’ {{ventilatory}} device {{is a difficult}} task that may concomitantly consider <b>technical</b> <b>performances</b> and ergonomics. While technical bench tests are essential to assess <b>technical</b> <b>performances</b> and a ventilator’s accuracy, a global ergonomics evaluation, taking into account different variables and dimensions, is crucial to enable physicians to focus on their patients, rather than on technological problems. Despite significant technological improvements, several ICU ventilators do exhibit low ergonomics performance and {{a high risk of}} misusage.|$|R

The games' Dreamcast and Sega Saturn ports were also lauded for their <b>technical</b> <b>performance,</b> matching the capabilities of the arcade versions. Conversely, the PlayStation ports were criticized for their removal of tag team battles and noticeable decline in frame rate and animation quality – changes which stemmed from the console's RAM limitations.|$|E
5|$|The macOS client debuted on June 23, 2015 to {{coincide}} with the release of the first expansion pack. The port was handled by TransGaming. Unlike console and Microsoft Windows PC versions of the expansion, the Mac release is only available in a two-in-one bundle containing the base game and the Heavensward expansion, titled Final Fantasy XIV Online. Current players of other versions of the game, including Mac players running the PC version via Boot Camp, are required to purchase this bundle in order to play using the native Mac client. On July 3, 2015, Square Enix suspended sales of the Mac version because of widespread reports of poor <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> and offered refunds to those who purchased it. Yoshida observed that the performance issues could be attributed to difficulties in transposing the game from Microsoft's proprietary DirectX graphical rendering libraries to OpenGL as well as a clerical error resulting in publishing the wrong minimum system requirements, both compounded by the hectic work schedule demanded by the release of an expansion pack. After new rounds of testing and optimization, sales of the Mac version resumed on February 23, 2016, accompanying the release of Patch 3.2.|$|E

He and Stanton thought {{that some of}} the game's assets were used excessively. Turi severely criticized the game's lighting system, saying that it looked blurry even given its nighttime setting. Miller also noted the game's sub-par texture, and was disappointed by its lack of visual appeal. Turi and Gies noted the difficulty of dragging items with the GamePad, but Gies thought it added tension to the game.|$|E
25|$|Chromatography {{technique}} developed substantially as {{a result}} of the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s and 1950s, for which they won the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods: paper chromatography, gas chromatography, and what would become known as high-performance liquid chromatography. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.|$|E

25|$|After Avellone and Parker {{joined the}} team, they {{organized}} {{a meeting in}} order to set a firm direction for the game and settled on the features that would be included and excluded in the game. Among the cut features include parkour, chase scenes with a motorcycle and yacht, and environmental interaction. A female character known as Uli Booi was completely scrapped after the meeting. The game structure was modified {{with the introduction of}} safehouses to make the game less linear. The minigames were also changed significantly. While the team initially wanted to remove them completely, Sega objected and as a result, the team modified them, making them faster. With all these changes, both Sega's confidence to the game and the team's morale were restored. However, while the team had settled on the game's design, more features were cut or downgraded due to time constraints. The artificial intelligence originally designed for the game drained the game's <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> thus they had to lower its complexity so that the game could run better. A female version of Micheal Thorton was planned, but it was canceled in order to save budget as the team would have needed to change dialogue and created new animations for the character. The mission debrief showing up after the player completed a mission was initially a bug discovered by one of the game's testers, before the team redeveloped it to become an official feature. Obsidian also added and refined most of the role-playing elements in early and mid 2009 per Sega's request.|$|E

Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot commended the character sprite animations and background details, claiming that [...] "there is no better looking 2D fighter on any console system". While Gerstmann also praised the port for its fast loading times and lack of slowdown, he criticized the game for its defense-oriented gameplay and unoriginal soundtrack. Game Informer lauded the port for running and looking identical to its arcade counterpart, declaring it [...] "one of the best arcade conversions ever seen to date".|$|E
500|$|Kameo {{was later}} {{included}} in Rare Replay, {{a compilation of}} 30 Rare titles, released for the Xbox One in August 2015. The game runs through the Xbox One's backward compatibility, which emulates select Xbox 360 titles on the newer console. [...] Kameo {{was among the first}} batch of games to be supported for the feature. The Rare Replay emulated release includes all original downloadable content for free and lets players migrate their Xbox 360 cloud saves to their Xbox One. Kameo performance in the Xbox One's emulator slightly improves upon its <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> on the Xbox 360 itself. Stephen Totilo (Kotaku) was surprised at his positive response to replaying Kameo on Rare Replay, having found the introductory stage off-putting when he sampled it at the Xbox 360's launch. He planned to return to the title. Chris Carter (Destructoid) wrote that while Kameo was not worth full price at its release, it was a welcome addition worth playing in the compilation.|$|E
500|$|Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition for Wii U {{received}} a mixed reception. GameRankings provided {{a score of}} 85%, and Metacritic provided a score of 85/100. Eurogamer's Richard Leadbetter was critical of <b>technical</b> <b>performance</b> including issues with visual quality and inconsistent framerate. EGMs Ray Carsillo said that the optional B.A.T. system made certain battles too easy. Carsillo also {{said it was the}} [...] "clearly inferior version" [...] of the game due to glitches and [...] "tacked on gimmicks". Nintendo World Report's Patrick Barnett wrote that certain uses of the Wii U controller made it [...] "the best way to experience Arkham City", but that some new features were a [...] "nuisance". Barnett added that it was [...] "on par, if not better, visually", than its counterparts. Joystiq's JC Fletcher opined that the persistent map screen and touch screen interface were appreciated, and complimented the use of augmented reality to explore crime scenes. Game Revolution's Blake Peterson praised the real-time management of information, upgrades and equipment that he considered made Batman more vulnerable, although Barnett included this as a point of criticism.|$|E

500|$|The game used a specially-developed {{proprietary}} engine {{developed by}} Iron Lore staff. This was done as, when development started, no third-party engines existed that could support the team's {{vision for the}} game: in Sullivan's words, there were [...] "plenty of technology solutions for someone creating a shooter, {{but not as much}} for a role-playing game". One of the key parts of the new engine was an environmental creation tool dubbed [...] "the editor" [...] by staff. This tool combined a tile-based horizontal plain with a height-based map, and allowed for subtle adjustments to environments and terrain with easy-to-use developer tools. Level and plain boundaries were set using cliffs and plateaus within the environment. Objects such as chest and enemies could be then [...] "dropped" [...] into environments using a point-and-click system, some of which could be directly integrated using special [...] "tile" [...] elements which stitched into the wider environment for objects such as bridges and crags. All of this necessitated a large amount of research on multiple subjects, including the flora of Egypt and the appearance of Ancient Greek roads and paths. This development tool was the version released with the retail version so players could create and share their own levels. Level and map creation was handled by a three-person team, with each one needing to agree upon a specific layout and design before it went into full production. While early builds used a high amount of detail along level boundaries, the team switched to simple boundary designs as they [...] "read better" [...] for players and allowed better <b>technical</b> <b>performance.</b> The challenge the content creation team set themselves was creating these areas while making boundaries seem natural. This combination of height and grid-based navigation and environments had not been done when the system was being designed in 2002: most of the map was shaped using the height map, while specialist features and horizontal navigation used the grid. In a preview about the game, the developers said the game was built around [...] "database driven modular proxies", a system where different elements within environments were seamlessly interacted and could interact freely. The artificial intelligence (AI) was designed so individual units would behave differently depending on situation and combat ability. The pathfinding for AI units such as NPCs and enemy units was handled using the PathEngine, a licensed middleware engine dedicated to this task. Titan Quest {{was one of the first}} major Western titles to use PathEngine.|$|E
