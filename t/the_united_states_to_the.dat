5|$|In {{addition}} to foreign dignitaries, the President's Guest House {{has traditionally been}} made available by the outgoing President of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> President-elect in the five days prior to his inauguration. In 1992, Bill Clinton chose {{to stay at the}} Hay–Adams Hotel instead of the guest house and, in 2009, a request by President-elect Barack Obama to take-up residence at the President's Guest House two weeks early was rejected because of its prior commitment to former Australian prime minister John Howard.|$|E
5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably {{came to the}} United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E

50|$|Pleasant Alexander Stovall (1857-1935) was <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{ambassador}} <b>to</b> Switzerland from 1913 {{until late}} 1919 or early 1920. Among other actions while representing <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in Switzerland he signed documents committing <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> {{be part of}} the World Court. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Senate later put so many restrictions and conditions on US entry into the World Court that the other nations participating in it refused <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> join.|$|R
5|$|The Abwehr {{was also}} active in Ireland. German {{intelligence}} operations effectively ended in September 1941 when police made arrests {{on the basis}} of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin, including that of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men {{at the start of the}} war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The British {{diplomatic}} mission to Belgium, under Ambassador Lancelot Oliphant, {{was attached to}} the government in exile. In March 1941, the Americans also sent an Ambassador, Anthony Biddle Jr., to represent <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governments in exile of Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and Norway. The Soviet Union, which had broken off diplomatic relations with Belgium in May 1941 (heavily influenced by the then-in force Nazi-Soviet Pact), re-established its legation to the government in exile {{in the aftermath of the}} German invasion and eventually expanded it to the rank of Embassy in 1943.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} airlift of critically needed items began {{almost immediately}} from <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Far East. The Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after {{the outbreak of}} the war. The Pacific airlift was further expanded by the charter of civil airlines planes. The Canadian Government lent the United Nations a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron of six transports, while the Belgian Government added several DC-4s to the effort. Altogether, the fleet of about 60 four-engine transport planes operating across the Pacific before June 25, 1950, was quickly expanded to approximately 250. In addition to these, there were MATS C-74 Globemaster and C-97 Stratofreighter planes operating between the United States and Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 15th, and coal production was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{returned}} to Washington in March 1877 {{at the start}} of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this would effectively return <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{scored the}} winning {{goal in the}} Olympic semi-final match against Canada in extra time, sending <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gold medal match against Japan. Her goal came in the 123rd minute, the latest goal ever scored {{by a member of}} the U.S. women's team and a FIFA record. The goal {{continued}} her propensity for late heroics in the closing stages of matches. Seventeen of her 28 total goals to date have come after the 60th minute. The match-winning goal was Morgan's team-high 20th in 2012, becoming only the sixth and youngest U.S. player to do so in a single year. In the final, a 2–1 win against Japan on August 9, Morgan assisted on a Carli Lloyd header. She ended the tournament with three goals, and a team-high four assists (tied with Megan Rapinoe) and ten points (tied with Rapinoe and Wambach).|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on February 14, 2008 in the United States and Canada, {{in the hopes of}} pulling in business on Valentine's Day. The film was targeted at an audience of both males and females below the age of 25. Jumper grossed $27.3million on 4,600 screens in 3,428 theaters from Friday to Sunday, ranking first for the weekend at the box office. In its first weekend, the film set the record for the largest February release in Korea and had the first place position in 11 of the 30 markets it was released in. For the first two weekends of its release, the film maintained its number one position in international markets, while slipping to the second position in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> release of Vantage Point. The film's worldwide gross is $221,231,186 with $80,172,128 from the box office in the United States and Canada and $142,059,058 from other territories. It was the 28th highest-grossing film worldwide for 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} Air Medals {{presented}} {{by the president of}} <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Civil Air Patrol went to Hugh Sharp and Eddie Edwards, who conducted the rescue in the S-39. This successful program, which spotted 173 German U-Boats, dropped 57 depth charges, hit 10 of the U-Boats, and sank two of them, was inevitably discontinued {{after the end of the}} second World War. Many of the planes used specifically for this program are now parts of exhibits, replaced by new aircraft that are more suited to teaching young students to fly and performing search and rescue, the current missions of the Civil Air Patrol. Currently, CTWG has two Cessna 172s, two Cessna 182s and one Cessna 182T with Garmin G1000 Glass cockpit. Connecticut Wing has the highest number of hours flown per aircraft of any state in the North East Region, and ranks high on a national scale.|$|E
