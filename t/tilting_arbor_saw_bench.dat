5|$|Since the university's {{establishment}} {{in the city}} in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 {{with the arrival of}} the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann <b>Arbor</b> again <b>saw</b> robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann <b>Arbor</b> <b>saw</b> increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.|$|R
50|$|Stationary or {{portable}} engines were commercially introduced {{early in}} the 1900s. The first commercial production was by the New Way Motor Company of Lansing, Michigan, US. The company produced air-cooled engines in single and twin cylinders in both horizontal and vertical cylinder format. Subsequent to their initial production which was exported worldwide, other companies took up the advantages of this cooling method, especially in small portable engines. Applications include mowers, generators, outboard motors, pump sets, <b>saw</b> <b>benches</b> and auxiliary power plants.|$|R

50|$|A {{report of}} the {{building}} at Millbank Wharf was drawn up by professional valuers in December 1900 {{in anticipation of the}} proposed incorporation of the company following year. The report stated that the main building comprised a three-room office, two storerooms, five cement kilns, two plaster ovens, a lime mill, a rending store, a circular <b>saw</b> <b>bench,</b> an iron store, a cement store and two engine room complete with boilers. Other buildings included lime kilns, coal stores, cement sheds, brick sheds, iron stores, slurry pits, a cement-drying building, a lime house and a chimney shed. The yard had a frontage to the River Itchen of nearly 400 ft and a rear frontage of 460 ft. The value of the whole property was estimated at £6670 freehold.|$|R
5000|$|Although not {{dissimilar}} in {{layout to}} {{other types of}} sawmills, case mills were typically smaller in scale owing to the smaller size of the logs that were milled and the smaller size of the end product. A three-person mill, comprising a single circular <b>saw</b> <b>bench</b> (number one bench) and a docking saw, could produce up to 500 cases per day. Logs were broken down at the number one bench into longitudinal lengths of timber (flitches). The flitches were cut to required length at the docking saw. Waste material from the initial breaking down process (including edging) was cut down for firewood at the docking saw or disposed of. The lengths of timber ready for assembly as cases were known as [...] "shooks".|$|R
50|$|When {{initially}} erected, the Kin Kin mill comprised {{only the}} number one <b>saw</b> <b>bench</b> and a docking saw. Both of these saws are still extant, but the docking saw has been relocated within the shed. The saws were powered by a tractor. Probably from the early 1950s after the mill was connected to electricity, a Canadian Saw, and number two bench were added and the docking saw was moved. The mill layout has remained largely unchanged since then. In its present form it resembles a typical sawmill layout of the 1950s. The original hand operated winch for moving logs through the breakdown saw remains extant and also the early electrical insulators tracing the original path of the cabling along {{the underside of the}} roof.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} paper explores {{the design of}} an automatic safety brake mechanism on a manual circular table saw machine which stops the blade from rotating when human flesh is detected in the blade proximity. Fatal injuries are occurring, human thumbs and entire hand cutting during operation when operator accidentally touches the spinning blade. It has {{become a matter of}} concern to develop the safety mechanism which can be retrofitted on old-model table saw machines used to train students at a university wood workshop. The researchers made use of capacitive proximity sensors to detect human flesh and then automatically activate the brake pawl to the rotating blade, D. C. injection brake voltage which abruptly stop the running motor. The design procedure confirmed the quick release of the safety mechanism within 0. 25 seconds as revealed from the simulation of circuits in Proteus software. With this design it is possible to stop the spinning blade in 0. 25 seconds, before the operator touches the spinning blade and also the mechanism is adoptable to all circular saw machines (panel <b>saw,</b> <b>bench</b> <b>saws),</b> thus making a work-safe environment on the circular saws...|$|R

40|$|The Analytical Development Section of Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) was {{requested}} by the Facilities Disposition Projects (FDP) to determine the holdup of enriched uranium in the 321 -M facility {{as part of an}} overall deactivation project of the facility. The 321 -M facility was used to fabricate enriched uranium fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the production reactors. The results of the holdup assays are essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to meet criticality safety controls. This report covers holdup measurements on two sawbench components that were used for cutting U-Al fuel rods. The benches contained U-Al residue scattered on the bench tops and bagged up in plastic containers. It was very important to obtain an estimate of the HEU content of this residue in order to remove criticality concerns before vacuuming it into a much smaller volume. A portable high purity germanium (HPGe) detection system and a portable sodium iodide (NaI) detection system were used to determine highly enriched uranium (HEU) holdup and to determine holdup Np- 237 and Am- 241 that were observed in these components. The measured Np- 237 and Am- 241 contents were especially important in these components because their presence is unusual and unexpected in 321 -M. It was important to obtain a measured value of these two components to disposition the <b>saw</b> <b>benches</b> and to determine whether a separate waste stream was necessary for release of these contaminated components to the E-Area Solid Waste Vault. The reported values for Np- 237 are < 0. 8 mg on each of the two bench tops and < 3 {micro}g in the bag of chips. The reported values for Am- 241 are < 500 ng on the two bench tops and < 15 ng in the bag of chips. Our results demonstrate an upper limit of {sup 235 }U content of 0. 4 g on the two benchtops and of 0. 1 mg in the bag of chips. These reported values completely eliminated the criticality concerns. This report discusses the methodology, non-destructive assay (NDA) measurements, and results of the holdup measured {{for each of the three}} actinide species in these <b>saw</b> <b>benches...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sawing yield is an {{important}} parameter for the sawmill profit. One way to increase the sawing yield is by a reduced saw kerf width, an adapted shrinking allowance, and a lower sawing allowance. The Swedish sawmills {{on the other hand}} see a risk of poorer sawing accuracy and sawing precision and at worst, more frequent saw blade failures. One problem with a reduced saw kerf width is the saw mismatch that may occur in double <b>arbor</b> <b>saw</b> machines. Saw mismatch occurs when the saw blades are displaced in axial direction with respect to each other due to wear, heat or mechanical disturbance. In this study the aim was to test the robustness of a laser triangulation unit used for measuring saw mismatch during sawmill operation. The aim was also to find a suitable response variable for saw mismatch which was evaluated by using the cant height, feed speed and average top diameter of the logs as predicting variables in a partial least squares regression. The goodness of prediction for each response variable was used to compare the response variables with each other. The results showed that the robustness when measuring saw mismatch by laser triangulation during ongoing sawmill production was satisfactory. The response variable with the best goodness of prediction (Q 2 = 0. 135) was defined using a sliding window with a size of 500 boards. Each element of the response variable was calculated as the share of boards within the sliding window exceeding a threshold value of 0. 5 mm. This response variable was positively correlated with the cant height, feed speed and average top diameter of the log. Future work requires a designed experiment where the predicting variables are varied systematically and where the effect of characteristics and wear of the saw blades is also considered.

50|$|In 1777 Jean-François de La Harpe’s {{proposal}} to install {{seats in the}} parterre sparked the debates between philosophes, playwrights, and officials about the desirability and motives behind seating the parterre. Marmontel insisted that plans to seat the parterre was really an imposition of the “aristocracy” on “theatrical democracy.” The theater architect, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, saw the plans for seating in a more positive light, and wrote that “The cabal will end, and we will judge authors more rationally once we have destroyed what is incorrectly called the enthusiasm of the parterre.” Among those who favoured seating the parterre were stage managers and independent music critics, who linked the boisterous parterre to moral decline in the theatre and <b>saw</b> <b>benches</b> {{as a way to}} “tame” them. Regardless of whether individuals advocated for or against installing benches, what is consistent is the belief that seating would pacify the parterre. Other records indicate that the move was also prompted by the series of fires in theater-houses and the realization that packed parterre crowds were a possible fire hazard.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time.

However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other planing machines in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R
