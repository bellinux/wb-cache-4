50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marquees</b> were an American doo-wop group {{formed in}} Washington, D.C., in 1957.

5|$|In March 2016, it was {{reported}} that López Habas would leave the club due to concerns over his ₹2.35 crore ($350,000) annual salary. On 25 April, he left for Pune. On 3 May, he was replaced by another Spaniard, former Villarreal manager José Francisco Molina.

5|$|The {{season was}} one of the best in the team's history, with 20 {{victories}} and a Tour de France with multiple noteworthy performances. Team leader Thomas Voeckler wore the yellow jersey as race leader for ten days; the second such occurrence of his career, after also leading for ten days in 2004. Unlike that race, however, Voeckler poised himself as a serious overall contender and took fourth place overall; the best result by a French rider since 2000. While he spent most of the Tour riding in Voeckler's service, Pierre Rolland won one of <b>the</b> <b>marquee</b> stages, up Alpe d'Huez, eventually finishing 11th overall and winning the young rider classification.|$|E

Larry understands and announces {{that he has a}} wife and children back home who are probably worrying about him.

5000|$|The group {{performed}} in the D.C. area and soon were introduced to Bo Diddley, who began working with <b>the</b> <b>Marquees</b> in his home recording studio. Diddley assigned <b>the</b> <b>Marquees</b> to Columbia subsidiary label Okeh Records after unsuccessfully attempting to get the group signed to his own label, Chess. On September 25, 1957, the group entered CBS Building in New York City to record five songs. Among them, were [...] "Wyatt Earp" [...] and [...] "Hey Little School Girl", backed by Diddley's band, as well as [...] "Billy's Heartaches" [...] and [...] "Baby, You're My Only Love", which had <b>the</b> <b>Marquees</b> record with singer Billy Stewart. Re-recorded versions of [...] "Wyatt Earp" [...] and [...] "Hey Little School Girl" [...] and Stewart's sides were released in November 1957; however, Okeh completely ignored the records and they quickly fell out of public notice.|$|R
5|$|British trad jazz band-leader Chris Barber {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in the {{development}} and popularisation of rhythm and blues in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric rhythm and blues, as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish <b>the</b> <b>Marquee</b> Club, which would become one of the major venues for British R bands. He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951, and would include Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters and Lonnie Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Okay Africa {{wrote that}} by its second year, the fair had become Europe's {{foremost}} contemporary African art fair, and Naomi Rea of Artnet News {{called it a}} necessary visit during the London Frieze Art Fair. In New York, Ben Davis of Artnet wrote that 1:54 NY was a highlight of the city's art fair week. Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow geographic scope like 1:54 highlight or ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the fair as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art fair trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and <b>the</b> <b>marquee</b> display of a popular artist at a fair for marginal artists.|$|E
