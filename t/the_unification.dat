40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{will present a}} type {{unification}} algorithm for type terms of Generic-Java. First we define a type system for expressions in Generic-Java. We give an ordering on the declared classes which represents the inheritance hierarchy. This ordering is extended to an ordering {{on the set of}} type terms. Finally <b>the</b> type <b>unification</b> problem on ordered type terms is solved by <b>the</b> type <b>unification</b> algorithm. 1 Introduction In version 1. 5 of sun's java (G-JAVA), generic types are implemented [1, 2]. Thismeans classes can have parameters. The type system is extended by parameterized types, type variables, and type terms. In this paper we present an ordering<= * on type terms, which represents the inheritance relation, and <b>the</b> type <b>unification</b> algorithm, which solves the problem to get a substitution oe for two giventype terms ` 1, ` 2, such that oe(` 1) <= * oe(` 2).
