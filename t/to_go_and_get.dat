500|$|Jonny Greenwood {{described}} [...] "Scatterbrain (As Dead as Leaves)" [...] as [...] "very {{simple and}} sort of quite pretty, but there's something about the music for me, the chords for me, where it never quite resolves." [...] The NME described the album's final track, [...] "A Wolf at the Door (It Girl. Rag Doll.)" [...] as [...] "a pretty song, with a sinister monologue {{over the top of}} it"; Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms' fairy tale. Yorke described the song's placement {{at the end of the}} album as [...] "sort of like waking you up at the end... it's all been a nightmare and you need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a glass of water now." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, he {{was again}} sent out on loan, {{this time to}} Bournemouth, also in League Two, for one month. Simpson said: [...] "We have a big squad and I felt that the {{opportunity}} for Michael <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a month out on loan at Bournemouth would do him the world of good." [...] Symes made his debut for Bournemouth on 15 November, as they lost 3–0 to Accrington Stanley. He returned to Shrewsbury {{at the end of}} his month loan spell, in which he failed to score from five appearances. He was immediately recalled to the Shrewsbury squad and came on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 defeat to league leaders Wycombe Wanderers the following weekend. Because of injury problems, Symes played only three more games, before he moved on loan, this time to Accrington Stanley, another League Two side. He made his Accrington debut the day following his transfer, helping them to a 2–1 victory at home to Exeter City. Symes scored with a headed goal to give Accrington a 1–0 victory against Grimsby Town, which proved to be the only goal he recorded in seven games for Accrington, before he returned to Shrewsbury Town at the end of the season. However, he was one of seven players released by Simpson after they lost the play-off final.|$|E

2500|$|While Lee herself downplayed autobiographical {{parallels}} in the book, Truman Capote, {{mentioning the}} character Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, described details he considered autobiographical: [...] "In my original version of Other Voices, Other Rooms I had that same man {{living in the}} house that used to leave things in the trees, and then I took that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> those things out of the trees. Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true. But you see, I take the same thing and transfer it into some Gothic dream, done in an entirely different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|John W. Johnson {{has said}} that the {{authorities}} and jurors were influenced by strong anti-Italian prejudice and the prejudice against immigrants widely held at the time, especially in New England. Against charges of racism and racial prejudice, Paul Avrich and Brenda and James Lutz point out that both men were known anarchist members of a militant organization, members of which had been conducting a violent campaign of bombing and attempted assassinations, acts condemned by most Americans of all backgrounds. Though in general anarchist groups did not finance their militant activities through bank robberies, a fact noted by the investigators of the Bureau of Investigation, this was not true of the Galleanist group. Mario Buda readily told an interviewer: [...] "Andavamo a prenderli dove c'erano" [...] ("We used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it [...] where it was") – meaning factories and banks. The guard Berardelli was also Italian.|$|E

She also stated that [...] "It's also about power, strength and heart. And being honest with yourself. The sound is hopeful, bright, and at peace with life's twists and turns." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the Cardinals' future, guitarist Neal Casal stated that: [...] "I have {{absolutely}} {{no idea what the}} future holds. The Cardinals were the best band I’ve ever been in, and I would love to play with them again. Only time will tell what’s going to happen. [...] I'll certainly miss it a lot." [...] In May 2009, drummer Brad Pemberton stated that: [...] "everyone was a bit fried, so it was the right time to step back for a minute. I encouraged Ryan <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> married, and have a life and find some peace; the guy hasn’t really slowed down in ten years, and he needed it as much as we did. Ryan and I have shared too much and are too good of friends to not ever do anything again, but I think we all need to do our own thing for a minute." ...|$|E
2500|$|Infielder Stephen Drew {{returned}} from the disabled list, with Grace once again optioned to Syracuse, and the Nationals began a nine-game swing through California on May 29. On {{the first game of}} the road trip, the Nationals obtained their second shutout win of the year, beating the San Francisco Giants 3–0 behind a strong start by Tanner Roark. The game was marred, however, by an eighth-inning brawl that broke out after Giants reliever Hunter Strickland, facing Harper for the first time since the Nationals right fielder went 2-for-2 with two home runs off him during the 2014 National League Division Series, drilled Harper in the hip with a 98mph fastball with his first pitch. Harper tossed aside his bat and charged Strickland on the mound, throwing his helmet wide to the left of Strickland before the two players traded punches. They were separated by their teammates, with Giants first baseman and former National Michael Morse quickly getting between them before being bowled over (and concussed) by Giants pitcher and former University of Notre Dame football star Jeff Samardzija, and ejected from the game. Harper said after the game that he decided immediately that the pitch was intentional: [...] "You never want to get suspended or anything like that, but sometimes you've got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> him. You can't hesitate. You either go to first base or you go after him, and I decided to go after him." [...] He suggested Strickland was retaliating for the 2014 home runs (which Strickland denied), saying, [...] "It was three years ago. ... I don't know why he's thinking about it. He's got a World Series ring, it's on his finger, and he can look at it every single night he wants to." [...] Both Harper and Strickland were issued suspensions by Major League Baseball, with Harper receiving a four-game penalty, which was lowered on appeal to three games. He began serving the suspension on May 31.|$|E
