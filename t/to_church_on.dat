It is made during Holy Week and then brought <b>to</b> <b>Church</b> <b>on</b> Great Saturday to be blessed after the Paschal Vigil. The name of the dish comes from Pascha, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of Easter.|$|E
25|$|When traveling, {{particularly}} on political business, {{he was more}} likely to attend church services. In the seven Sundays during the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, he went <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> three, attending Anglican, Quaker, and Catholic services. During his tours of the nation in his two terms as President, he attended religious services in each city, sometimes as frequently as three services in a day.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto Transit Commission {{eliminated}} all Sunday {{stops on}} June 7, 2015, as these stops slowed down streetcars {{making it more}} difficult to meet scheduled stops. Sunday stops, which served Christian churches, were deemed unfair to non-Christian places of worship, which never had the equivalent of a Sunday stop. Toronto created Sunday stops in the 1920s along its streetcar routes to help worshippers get <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sunday.|$|E

50|$|WWP stopped {{national}} {{releases of}} its {{films in the}} late 1980s.

25|$|In a {{case-control study}} done {{following}} 5,286 Californians over a 28-year {{period in which}} variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period. However, this can be partly {{be attributed to a}} better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less and eat a healthier diet.|$|E
25|$|The Romanovs {{were placed}} in the Napolnaya School, on the fringe of the town. The school was small, {{consisting}} of only six rooms, the furniture basic but scanty. Each prisoner received an iron bed. They were allowed to move into the desolate former schoolrooms and sort out their living arrangements on their own. Grand Duke Sergei shared a room with Feodor Remez and Prince Paley. Although the captives were under the strict guard of the Red Army soldiers, they were allowed to walk in town, to talk to people and to go <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> feasts days. Preparing to spend a long time in Alapayevsk, they planted flowers and vegetable gardens near the school and spent many hours working there. On rainy days, the Romanovs read Russian novels to each other. Gradually, the regimen toughened and they were forbidden to take walks. The school was encircled with a barbed-wire fence and small trenches. Two weeks later, they were murdered.|$|E
25|$|Throughout this period, {{the slaves}} were sold aboard the {{arriving}} ships or at ad hoc gatherings in town's taverns. Runaways and minor rebellions prompted the 1739 Security Act requiring all white men to carry weapons {{at all times}} (even <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sundays), but before it had fully taken effect the Cato or Stono Rebellion broke out. The white community had recently been decimated by a malaria outbreak and the rebels killed over forty whites before being stopped by the colonial militia. The planters attributed the violence to recently imported Africans and agreed to a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charlestown, relying on the communities they already possessed. The 1740 Negro Act also tightened controls, requiring one white for every ten blacks on any plantation and banning slaves from assembling together, growing their own food, earning money, or learning to read. Drums were banned owing to Africans' use of them for signaling, although slaves continued to be permitted string and other instruments. When the moratorium expired and Charlestown reopened to the slave trade in 1750, {{the memory of the}} Stono Rebellion meant that slaves from the Congo and Angola were avoided.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack single {{was written}} by Beyonc√©, Missy Elliott, Lana Moorer, Marie Wright, Jonathan Burks, LaShaun Owens, Karriem Mack, Walter Murphy, and Gene Pistilli. Production was handled by Elliott. [...] "Fighting Tempation is an R-funk song with a fun vibe. The song samples Uncle Louie's 1979 song [...] "I Like Funky Music". Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that the song's lyrics make {{reference}} to a [...] "celebration of ladies' night out and waiting for true love." [...] According to Dani Boobyer of the United Kingdom-based website, The Situation, [...] "Fighting Temptation" [...] has [...] "a well worn message about striving for the best and fighting against negativity." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine found that Missy notices pleasure and joy in sins that make people go <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sundays, but in reality, the [...] "party people" [...] are {{no different from the}} churchgoers, who sin in their song and music. Lastly, the song's strong female presence is only less than the song's religious arrogance.|$|E
500|$|Clarence Waldron {{described}} Cole's [...] {{interpretation of}} the seventh track, [...] "Joy to the World", as [...] "tak listeners <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> her gospel flavored rendition", while a writer from Billboard called it [...] "rollicking". The eighth and ninth tracks are covers of Vera Lynn's [...] "The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot" [...] and Ida Zecco's [...] "A Song for Christmas" [...] respectively. The tenth track is a cover of [...] "Silent Night". [...] "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)" [...] is {{the third and final}} cover of Nat King Cole on the album; David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the decision to cover [...] "The Christmas Song" [...] with no vocals from her father benefited the song, which he said worked better [...] "alone, not as a duet with the dead". The album concludes with the title track [...] "Holly and Ivy", which Waldron called a [...] "touching Christmas ballad" [...] and described Cole's vocal performance as belonging to [...] "one of the sweetest songbirds".|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{feels that}} episodes such as [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] are his {{favorite}} episodes to write {{because they have}} a [...] "solid theme or an issue" [...] (in this case, religion and theft), that one can [...] "discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways." [...] Producer Jeff Martin said that the writers tried to use a [...] "very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment," [...] considering cable theft to be [...] "essentially a victimless crime." [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment" [...] was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode [...] "Homer the Heretic", in which Homer stops going <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, [...] "remember the Sabbath and keep it holy", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, [...] "We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe we could look to other commandments?" ...|$|E

Breaking a drug habit is not easy and those who enter the program must adopt new habits which are conductive to recovery.

2500|$|The Duchess of Kent was {{received}} into the Catholic Church in 1994. This {{was a personal}} decision, and she received the approval of The Queen. As she explained {{in an interview on}} BBC, [...] "I do love guidelines and the Catholic Church offers you guidelines. I have always wanted that in my life. I like to know what's expected of me. I like being told: You shall go <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sunday and if you don't you're in for it!" [...] Basil Hume, then Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster and thus spiritual leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, warned the Church against triumphalism over the Duchess's conversion.|$|E

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the times, Rottalers were {{expected}} to be versatile enough to pull the plow during the week and the carriage <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sundays. Throughout the 19th century, Anglo-Norman, Cleveland bay and Oldenburg horses were imported to keep the Rottaler vibrant, and by 1906 the Rottaler Warmblood Horse Breeding Association was formed. In 1963, the breeding aim was redirected towards the production of more agile, sensitive riding horses, and the brand was changed from [...] "R" [...] to [...] "B". The Rottaler mares were bred to Hanoverians and Westphalians, and over successive generations, the breed threatened to disappear forever. It wasn't until 1991 that the Rottaler was re-established within the Bavarian association, and by that time there were scant few lines left. However, what struck the spectators at the first inspection of Rottaler mares in 1994 was the vitality of the mares, which had an average age of over 15.|$|E
2500|$|Omar Devone Little is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the HBO drama series The Wire, portrayed by Michael K. Williams. He is a notorious Baltimore stick-up man, frequently robbing street-level drug dealers. He is legendary around Baltimore for his characteristic duster under which he hides his shotgun, large caliber handgun and bulletproof vest, {{as well as}} for his facial scar, and his habit of hauntingly whistling [...] "The Farmer in the Dell" [...] when stalking the streets. When people see or hear him approaching, they run away and will often warn others by shouting [...] "Omar comin'!" [...] Omar has a strict moral code, which involves refusal to harm innocent people or use profanity, setting him apart from other street-level characters. Also his homosexuality and privately tender nature are in obvious contrast with typical notions of masculinity attached to violent criminals. He also cares for his grandmother and is seen escorting her <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sunday mornings.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly Clarkson {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (n√©e Rose), a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer.

Her parents divorced when she was six years old, wherein her brother went to go live with their father, her sister {{went to live with}} an aunt and she stayed with her mother. Clarkson's mother later remarried, to Jimmy Taylor. Her ancestry is Greek (from a maternal great-grandfather), Welsh, English, Irish, German, and Scottish. Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said: [...] "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I‚Äôve always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I‚Äôve just gotten a lot closer just because He‚Äôs the only one I can lean on." [...] She later said of her upbringing: [...] "My family was highly conservative; I had to go <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>on</b> Sunday and Wednesday." ...|$|E
