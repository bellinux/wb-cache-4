40|$|Macroscopic <b>tribometry</b> {{is linked}} to {{classical}} atomistic simulations {{in order to improve}} understanding of the nanoscale interfacial processes during sliding of hydrogenated DLC (a-C:H) against a metal (W) in dry and lubricated conditions. Experimentally, using an online tribometer, wear and roughness measurements are performed after each sliding cycle, which are then correlated with the frictional resistance. Ex situ analysis is also performed on the worn surfaces (i. e. plates and counterfaces) using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy imaging of the near-surface region. Then, in order to elucidate the atomistic level processes that contribute to the observed microstructural evolution in the experiments, classical molecular dynamics are performed, employing a bond order potential for the tungsten–carbon–hydrogen system. Macroscopic <b>tribometry</b> shows that dry sliding of a-C:H against W results in higher frictional resistance and significantly more material transfer compared with lubricated conditions. Similarly, the molecular dynamic simulations exhibit higher average shear stresses and clear material transfer for dry conditions compared with simulations with hexadecane as a lubricant. In the lubricated simulations, the lower shear stress and the absence of a material transfer are attributed to hexadecane monolayers that are partially tethered to the a-C:H surface and significantly reduce adhesion and mechanical mixing between the sliding partners...|$|E

In situ ATR/FT-IR <b>tribometry</b> allowed the measurement of the friction force during the tribological tests and its correlation with ATR/FT-IR results, providing an insight into the chemical reactions taking place at the buried interface. The TPPT molecule, which did not behave as a friction-modifier additive, reacted at the air-oxidized iron surface upon tribotesting at 423 K to give pyrophosphate, organo-phosphate, and sulfate species. The oxygenated compounds produced by the oxidation of the base oil (poly-α-olefin, PAO) during the tribological tests, adsorbed onto the iron surface and reacted with it to form carbonates and carboxylates. During the tribotests, the iron coating was worn away and corroded by the aggressive species formed during the thermo-oxidative aging of PAO. This resulted in the availability of iron cations necessary {{for the production of}} orthophosphate compounds. The ATR/FT-IR results also suggested that the rate of tribofilm formation was lower than that of tribofilm removal. The ex situ XPS analysis corroborated the formation of short-chain iron polyphosphates, organo-phosphates, and iron sulfates, together with carbonates and carboxylates. Long-chain polyphosphates and sulfoxides were also generated in the boundary lubricant layers formed by TPPT at 423 K.

Pentaerythrite ester and trimellitic acid ester were used as lubricants. The lubricants differed in their molecular structure but showed only minor differences in their rheological and cohesive energetic properties. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} lubricants on static and dynamic friction, macroscopic oscillatory <b>tribometry</b> experiments and gliding experiments were carried out. The surface and interfacial energies of PEEK, lubricant, and steel, which can be used to determine e. g. the spreading tendency of the lubricant, were employed to explain the tribological characteristics of the system. The gliding experiments exhibited a velocity dependence of the coefficient of friction which indicates a rate-and-state type of friction. Trimellitic acid ester resulted in the lowest static and dynamic friction values due to its high tendency to spread. A different static friction behavior was found for pentaerythrite ester, which indicates a possible lubricant-induced mobilization of the polymer surface chains. This finding was supported by an increased interaction energy measured by contact angle measurements. The macroscopic oscillatory <b>tribometry</b> was shown to be a unique and precise method to investigate the transition from static to dynamic friction and to quantify macroscopic adhesive friction. Both types of experiments used a polished steel surface as a frictional partner, which favors the adhesive component of friction.

40|$|Contact fatigue driven wear is a {{principal}} design concern for gear and camshaft engineering of power systems. To better understand how to engineer contact fatigue resistant surfaces, the effects of electroless nickel and hydrogenated diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings on the fatigue life at 108 cycles of SAE 52100 steel were studied using ultrasonic fatigue methods. The addition of DLC and electroless nickel coatings to SAE 52100 bearing steel {{had no effect on}} the fatigue life. Different inclusion types were found to affect the stress intensity value beyond just the inclusion size, as theorized by Murakami. The difference in stress intensity values necessary to propagate a crack for Ti (C,N) and alumina inclusions was due to the higher driving force for crack extension at the Ti (C,N) inclusions and was attributed to differences {{in the shape of the}} inclusion: rhombohedral for the Ti (C,N) versus spherical for the oxides. A correction factor was added to the Murakami equation to account for inclusion type. The wear properties of DLC coated SAE 52100 and chilled cast iron were studied using pin-on-disk <b>tribometry</b> and very high cycle ultrasonic <b>tribometry.</b> A wear model that includes sliding thermal effects as well as thermodynamics consistent with the wear mechanism for DLCs was developed based on empirical results from ultrasonic wear testing to 108 cycles.

A design of experiments was conducted to understand how the laser processing parameters of power, speed, and beam size, as well as carbon content of the steel, affected surface hardness.

With the recent trend of miniaturization, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) have taken centre stage, featuring components with scales in dimensions as small as nanometres. In this PhD study, two approaches to solving MEMS tribology problems have been pursued. First, a novel direct lubrication method using well-known lubricants such as perfluoropolyether (PFPE) and multiply alkylated cyclopentane (MAC) was developed and tested using reciprocating sliding and actual MEMS <b>tribometry.</b> The second approach utilized the concept of hydrodynamic lubrication and selective surface modification for MEMS. To combat spreading and starvation of lubricants in small contacts such as in MEMS, selective modification of the silicon surface with hydrophobic (non-wetting) and hydrophilic (wetting) portions was carried out and found to increase the force required to move a droplet of lubricant from a designated location on the surface. Octadecylamine and dodecylamine were also used as additives to successfully induce autophobicity in hexadecane, and the various spreading behaviours investigated.

The presence of mucin also results in a shift of the mixed lubrication regime to lower entrainment speeds. The observed boundary lubrication behavior of mucin was found {{to depend on the}} bulk concentration, and we linked this to the structure and dynamics of the adsorbed mucin films, which are assessed using optical waveguide light spectroscopy. We observe a composite structure of the adsorbed mucin layer, with its internal structure governed by entanglement. The film thickness of this adsorbed layer increases with concentration, while the boundary friction coefficient for rough surfaces was found to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the adsorbed film. This link between lubrication and structure of the film is consistent with a viscous boundary lubrication mechanism, i. e., a thicker adsorbed film, at a given sliding speed, results in a lower local shear rate and, hence, in a lower local shear stress.

In these measurements, the relative motion of the surfaces in contact was performed in a linear reciprocating manner. Different methods to distinguish between plowing friction and sliding friction are compar ed. Our results with spherical sliders show that the widening rate of the wear track is linearly proportional to the plowing term, provided that the spheres do not sink in the Cu sample rapidly.

Environmental conditions appear to affect the mechanism of boundary lubrication in different ways, depending on the contact pressure. Tests carried out at 0. 5 N applied load showed low friction and no detectable wear in a nitrogen atmosphere, and a substantial increase in both wear and friction in humid air. It is proposed that the presence of water in the IL induces a change {{in the structure of the}} confined lubricant film, leading to contact between the sliding surfaces. At higher load (4. 5 N), the observation of wear, both under nitrogen and in humid air, reveals that the film is no longer able to prevent contact between asperities, which now dominates the observed tribological behavior. XP-spectra acquired on samples tribostressed at high load, under the two environmental conditions, reveal evidence for the formation of a reaction layer that is hydrolyzed or oxidized in the presence of water and oxygen, suggesting that the variation of wear with the environment is related to changes in the tribochemical reactions involving the silicon surface...|$|E

Compact light weight and dry sump (significantly reduced volume of lubricant) are the desired {{attributes}} for high performance racing transmissions, whilst improving upon efficiency and reliability remain paramount objectives. The complex multi-objective {{nature of this}} task points to an integrated approach to lubricant-mechanical system optimisation. The extreme operating conditions in racing transmissions, such as contact kinematics and thermal loading present significant tribological challenges. Thin lubricant films in non-Newtonian shear are subjected to mixed thermo-elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Under these conditions boundary active lubricant species often determine the contact tribological performance rather than the bulk rheological properties of the lubricant itself.

Stellite 21, a cobalt‐chrome‐molybdenum alloy, was also produced by SPS. Stellite 21 has low stacking fault energy and a hexagonal phase which forms during sliding that both contribute to low interfacial shear and friction.

Coating composition, crystallographic orientation, roughness, critical load, hardness, friction coefficient and surface energy were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scratch testing, nanoindentation, ball-on-disc <b>tribometry</b> and the contact angle method respectively. A statistical design of experiment matrix was used to investigate {{the effect of the}} Ti and MoS[subscript 2] target powers on the friction coefficient and surface energy of the coatings. From this designed experiment, it was observed that increasing MoS[subscript 2] target power was associated with increasing surface energy and decreasing friction coefficient and target powers had statistically significant effects on these parameters. Crystallinity, roughness and hardness of the coatings increased with increasing Ti concentration. A mathematical model of the effects of Ti and MoS[subscript 2] target powers on the friction coefficient and surface energy of the coatings has been fit to the experimental results using the response surface method. Uncoated and MoS[subscript 2]–Ti coated Si micromolds were used in hot-embossing for a comparative study on replication performance of uncoated and various coated micromolds. Hotembossed PMMA microstructures showed that coating improve replication performance of Si micromolds. Si micromold coated with co-sputter of Ti and MoS[subscript 2] at power of 300 and 75 W respectively, showed better replication quality among the selected target powers...|$|E
40|$|In {{locomotor}} biomechanics, {{three groups}} of constraints are usually encountered : pressure, traction and torsion (Kamina, 2005). In supra-maximal conditions, all of these contraints {{would be responsible for}} some disease of equine locomotor systems (Radin et al., 1972; Radin, 1983; Smith et al., 2002). In order to understand better the constraints in the equine locomotor dynamics, some investigations have been carried out. Moreover, some measurement methods, based on the mechanics of Newton, have been performed. This work consists of three different experimental approaches: The first approach was an ex vivo micro-systemic model of the diarthrodial cartilage-cartilage contact : from osteochondral specimens in contact, dynamic frictional constraints were measured by <b>tribometry</b> using a pin-on-disc tribometer in Coulomb’s regime. The effects of age and load on the frictional response were studied. The second approach was an ex vivo macro-systemic model of the diarthrodial cartilage-cartilage contact : from whole fetlock joints fixed into an original pendulum tribometer and mobilized, dynamic visco-frictional constraints have been followed in viscous regime. The effect of a lipid solvent on the synovial fluid was studied. The third approach was an in vivo macro-systemic model of the diarthrodial cartilage-cartilage contact : from distal forelimbs, cinematic, cinetic and radiographic data have been collected, then tendon tensions and joint contact forces components were calculated using an inverse dynamic analysis. From a sensitivity analysis, the effect of raised hell (0 °, 6 °, 12 °) were elucidated. In the first approach : (i) an original equine joint friction test model using a cartilage-on-cartilage arrangement (pin-on-disc) has been performed, (ii) cartilage ageing was found, under experimental operating conditions, to be responsible for an increase in friction coefficient, (iii) lubrication remained stable when young cartilage was loaded whereas lubrication of older cartilage was affected by increased load. In the second approach : (i) an original equine joint pendulum tribometer has been designed, (ii) visco-frictionnal data have confirmed the joint pendulum damping can be modelled like a harmonic oscillator fluid damping, (iii) the lipid solvent injection into the fetlock joint increased the visco-frictional parameters of the joint and the damping time decreased, suggesting that the lubrication capacity was compromised. In the third approach : (i) an original equine distal limb model with tendinous variable pulleys was described, (ii) polynomial relationships of second order between the variation of the dorsal angle of the fetlock joint and the moment arm variation of the deep digital and superficial digital flexors tendons have been established, (iii) the joint contact force components of the coffin joint and of the fetlock joint have been calculated during the phase of the trot, (iv) the effect of raised heel on the tendinous tensions and on the joint contact force components was established, suggesting that the use of heel wedges to reduce the loading of the coffin joint may in fact increase the loading of the fetlock joint. The two ex vivo equine articular models (<b>tribometry)</b> are some original and complementary mechanical analysis tools: the pin-on-disc tribometer may highlight the mechanical properties of the triplex cartilage-synovial fluid-cartilage that are related with the structural properties (contact surface), and the pendulum tribometer may clarify the mechanical properties of the articular lubricant in a very realistic intra-articular environment (quasi anaerobic). These two tools could be used to characterize the mechanical properties of some new articular prosthesis and lubricants in the future. Finally, the numerical in vivo model (dynamic inverse analysis), calculating dynamic tendinous tensions and dynamic joint contact force components in the equine distal forelimb, is equally a very interressing and original tool. Indeed, it measures some articular intrinsic informations, in non-invasive manner (no using of intra-articular and intra-tendinous constraint gaugues) and can be perfectly integrated in a classical equine locomotor analysis...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen-free, hard carbon {{thin films}} are {{exciting}} material coatings candidates as solid lubricants. Two examples, ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C), are particularly promising, because their exceptional mechanical and tribological properties are combined with extremely smooth surfaces. However, their tribological performance can be seriously affected by variations in humidity. These materials do not perform well in vacuum or inert environments. The mechanisms controlling the friction and wear of UNCD and ta-C {{are not well}} understood because of a fundamental lack of physical understanding of the surface interactions. ^ The aim of this thesis is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of friction and wear in UNCD and ta-C films. An experimental protocol is defined {{to examine the relationship}} between the sliding environment, tribological performance, and mechanical and chemical changes to the films. Self-mated reciprocating <b>tribometry</b> in controlled environments measure UNCD and ta-C friction as a function of load and relative humidity (RH). Scanning white light interferometry measures the post-mortem height profile. Finally, chemical changes inside the wear track are characterized by x-ray photoelectron emission microscopy combined with near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (X-PEEM-NEXAFS) spectromicroscopy. Results for ta-C and UNCD show that both films, like single crystal diamond, perform better at lower loads or with higher amounts of RH in the environment. Previous hypotheses for this suggested that lubrication for these films either comes in the form of graphitization (converting carbon from diamond-type bonding to graphite-like bonding) or by passivation (the termination of broken carbon bonds by species in the environment, such as water). All spectroscopic evidence shows no evidence of graphitization, but support the passivation hypothesis. Furthermore, the spectroscopy shows that the passivation is in the form of hydroxyl groups, most likely from water. This affects the run-in (period at the start of sliding of high friction as asperities are being smoothed) behavior of these films. The level of passivation also controls whether the films have high or low friction. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{tribological}} {{behavior of}} a silica/silicon tribopair lubricated with anhydrous fluorinated ionic liquids was investigated by pin-on-disk <b>tribometry.</b> A first series of tests was designed to detect the onset of surface damage {{as a function of}} sliding speed. 1 -ethyl-, 1 -hexyl and 1 -dodecyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl) imide ([EMIM] TFSI, [HMIM] TFSI, [DDMIM] TFSI), and 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium tris(perfluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate ([EMIM] FAP) were selected as lubricants. Elastohydrodynamic predictive formulas for minimum film thickness (h 0 EHL) were used to estimate the value of the critical h 0 EHL at the transition to mixed lubrication, which was identified {{on the basis of the}} variations observed in friction upon decreasing the sliding speed. Taking into account the composite roughness of the counterparts (σ ~ 1. 1 nm), the differences in the critical value of h 0 EHL measured for the various ILs are suggested to reflect changes in the interfacial structure of the confined ILs. In particular, the possible effects associated with the alkyl chain attached to the imidazolium cation, or with the type of anion, are discussed on the basis of models of the IL/solid interface presented in the recent literature. The second part of the investigation focuses on the tribological behavior observed with a SiO 2 /Si tribopair lubricated with 1 -ethyl- and 1 hexyl- 3 -imidazolium-based bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl) imide ILs under boundary conditions. Tests were carried out under conditions that prevent fluid-film lubrication, so as to allow the study of the boundary lubrication regime over an extended range of speed. The mechanism of wear was investigated on the basis of a chemical, structural and topographical analysis of the worn surfaces. The prevailing mode of surface damage is described on the basis of a comparison with results previously obtained with other imidazolium-based ILs tests as lubricants for the same tribopair. The new results revealed some further important details on the relationship between the chemical structure of the IL and the wear mechanism of the investigated tribopair...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} reciprocating {{sliding friction}} experiments of {{three types of}} magnetron-sputtered vanadium carbide/amorphous carbon nanocomposite coatings, VC 1 − x/a-C, against alumina counterparts under unlubricated conditions. It links micro- to macroscale tribology {{in order to provide}} {{a better understanding of the}} sliding mechanisms of these nanocomposite coatings with varying constitution and microstructure (i. e. by varying the C/V concentration ratio between 1. 2 and 2. 9). Correspondingly, the volume fraction of the amorphous carbon phase (a-C) increases with increasing the carbon content as shown by electron microprobe studies, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy; simultaneously, the volume fraction of nanocrystalline vanadium carbide (VC 1 − x) decreases, and the crystallite size and crystallinity of the thin films decrease with increasing carbon content. These constitution and microstructure changes have an impact both on the mechanical and the tribological properties of the coatings. Mechanical properties characterization shows that the indentation hardness (H) and the reduced modulus (Er) of the coatings decrease with increasing the carbon concentration (i. e. H ranges between 15 and 33 GPa and Er ranges between 239 and 391 GPa for the low and high vanadium concentration respectively). A similar behavior was also observed with the results on the critical load of failure obtained from scratch tests, where the coatings with the highest vanadium concentration exhibits higher critical load of failure and thus, better coating adhesion. However, reciprocating micro- and macroscale tribological tests performed at a relative humidity level of 45 ± 5 % (i. e. normal load in the microtribological experiments is between 100 mN and 1 N and for the macroscale <b>tribometry</b> the normal load is 20 N) reveal higher friction values and increased wear with the high vanadium content coatings. This sliding behavior is attributed to differences in the third body formation (i. e. carbon based transfer- and tribo-film) and velocity accommodation modes, which are analyzed ex situ by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy...|$|E
