He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E

5|$|The {{station has}} been the site of several major {{accidents}} involving locomotives. In 1843, the Sloatsburg station {{was the site of}} a large accident by train full of milk bottles. On December 31, 1855, the railroad's Cincinnati Express was thrown off the tracks near the Sloatsburg station, when it tried to avoid a countrymen and his four mules, who were crossing the tracks. Three of the mules were killed and mutilated by the train, while the fourth died soon after. There was no damage to the cars or injuries to the passengers. In the early days of August 1856, a girl by the name of McGraff was injured by an oncoming train near the station after carelessly walking onto the tracks. <b>The</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>who</b> were in a poor state financially, was given $45 (1856 USD) in return for their troubles from the Board of Directors in nearby Goshen. On February 21, 1858, a train heading southbound experienced an accident when a brakeman, John Freeland, fell off the train and was run over. Freeland's legs were severed in the incident, and one arm was broken. They hurried Freeland southbound on a nearby train, but died by the time the train reached Paterson, New Jersey towards the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Several months {{pass with}} Carlisle {{monitoring}} Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter Irina sees Renesmee {{from a distance}} and believes her to be an immortal child. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and {{because they could not}} be trained nor restrained, they destroyed entire villages. They were eventually executed, as were <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> created them, and the creation of such children outlawed. Irina goes to the Volturi to report what she has seen. Alice sees the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denali, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield which had protected her from Edward's mind reading even when she was human, and which she can now extend to protect others from attacks.|$|E

Child support is paid to help with the children's day-to-day living expenses, and covers a lot of things, from new clothes to school supplies to the children's share of the rent. Child support is not a fee a parent must pay to see the children. Child support {{has nothing to do with}} custody or guardianship; it has nothing to do with access, parenting time or contact; it has nothing to do with whether a parent is a good parent or a bad parent.

In his autobiography, Franklin writes: [...] "In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way.

500|$|The manga's content {{has been}} {{controversial}} in the United States. In November 1999, Toys [...] "R" [...] Us removed Viz's Dragon Ball from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had [...] "borderline soft porn" [...] after he bought them for his four-year-old son. Commenting on the issue, manga critic Susan J. Napier determined the ban as {{a difference in}} culture due to Japan having tolerance for sexuality in manga while other countries not feeling the same way. After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series in 2000 to maintain its wide distribution. Viz made some [...] "concessions" [...] as well, and assured readers that all changes were approved by Toriyama and Shueisha. Toriyama made suggestions himself such as obscuring Goku's genitals with objects, rather than [...] "neuter him". A fan petition was created, garnering over 10,000 signatures, and a year later, Viz announced they would stop censoring Dragon Ball and increased its [...] "age rating" [...] to 13 and up instead, reprinting the first three graphic novels. However, they continued to censor several characters' lips by shading them in completely. This avoided racist stereotypes, {{such as that of}} Mr. Popo's image. In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the Dragon Ball manga from their school district because it [...] "depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children". Esther Keller, Robin Brenner and Eva Volin of School Library Journal had no opinion whether or not removing [...] the manga from all schools in that district was right. However, Brenner and Volin criticize <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> had a problem with the manga for going to a county council member who is involved with politics instead of to the librarian of the school that carries the manga.|$|E

Similarly, it is also considered disrespectful to fight {{in front of an}} elder and one should not raise their voice, speak angrily, or make rude comments/gestures.
