5|$|Having {{lost their}} {{hair from the}} lake's pollution, the Griffins are at home wearing {{powdered}} wigs, an effect that compels Stewie to play several classical compositions, including those by Joseph Haydn and Georg Friedrich Handel, with Peter appearing as Antonio Salieri. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{a reference to the}} 1984 film Amadeus.|$|E
5|$|Deciding {{to sneak}} into the concert, Brian agrees to dress as rapper Kanye West, and is forced to sing one of his songs by a {{security}} guard. Despondent, Brian then begins singing the theme song to 1972 NBC sitcom Sanford and Son. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> not shown on TV; Stewie and Brian sneak into the concert in the televised version.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> a pastiche of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, {{who had lived}} in England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> further embellished {{around the}} Guru Rinpoche (Padmashambahava) image {{and also in}} the palace, with gods and goddesses in the heavens, with gate keepers at the four gates with an army of {{messengers}} and servants; all trying to crush the demons to dust. The supporting staff shown are said to represent the Himalayan tribes of pre-Buddhist periods.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> second <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> a <b>scene</b> toward <b>the</b> end of {{the episode}} in which Don and Charlie talk while Don prepares for <b>the</b> arrest. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> {{original}} script as Charlie's emotional reward and as the reformation of Don and Charlie's partnership. During production, the production crew realized {{that they did not}} have enough time to film <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> removed from <b>the</b> production schedule.

5|$|Arya {{once again}} returns {{to watch the}} play {{featuring}} Lady Crane. She sneaks backstage during the last act and poisons Lady Crane's rum. As she attempts to leave, Lady Crane stops her, and they discuss acting and Lady Crane's early life. Back in the dressing room, Arya stops Lady Crane from drinking her rum, and warns her that her rival Bianca wants her dead. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> witnessed by the Waif, who returns to tell Jaqen H'ghar of Arya's failure. Jaqen gives the Waif permission to kill Arya, {{on the condition that}} Arya doesn't suffer. Meanwhile, Arya retrieves her sword, Needle, from the rocks where she had hidden it and takes it to her room.|$|E
5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
5000|$|According to one source, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> deleted from <b>the</b> {{version of}} the film that aired on HBO. Another source says that <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> not deleted, but the word [...] "Carlucci" [...] was bleeped in the dialogue, with the name masked in <b>the</b> credits. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> remains on <b>the</b> DVD {{version of the}} film.|$|R

5000|$|However, some of <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> have <b>been</b> [...] "enhanced" [...] for viewers' entertainment, and the {{way that}} <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> cut {{together}} pushes strongly on the conventions of a comedy sketch show.|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Scene</b> <b>is</b> the Palace of Cupid, compos'd of wreath'd Columns of the Corinthian Order; the Wreathing is adorn'd with Roses, and the Columns {{have several}} little Cupids flying about 'em, {{and a single}} Cupid {{standing}} upon every Capital. At a good distance are seen three Arches, which divide the first Court from {{the other part of}} the Building: The middle Arch is noble and high, beautified with Cupids and Festoons, and supported with Columns of the foresaid Order. Through these Arches is seen another Court, that leads to the main Building, which is at a mighty distance. All the Cupids, Capitals and Inrichments of the whole Palace are of Gold. Here the Cyclops are at work at a forge, forging great Vases of Silver. The Musick strikes up, they dance, hammering the Vases upon Anvils. After the Dance, Enter Vulcan.|$|E
5|$|The carvings at {{the east}} {{entrance}} are battered and blurry. One in {{the southeast corner of}} the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the Umamaheshvara story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} before <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> shot he had little sleep, so he looked {{suitably}} worn out, and Sam Wood shot <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> without rehearsal. He called out for Randy, which {{was not in the}} script, but Ann Sheridan was there and responded. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> effective and {{there was no need for}} another take.|$|R

5|$|The {{left-hand}} wing {{depicts the}} Crucifixion. It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling {{about in the}} mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> framed against an azure sky {{with a view of}} Jerusalem in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.|$|E
5|$|The only clue {{found at}} <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button. Mulder and Scully check {{all of the}} employees and discover {{that one of the}} clerks, Derwood Spinks, is missing his button. Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record. Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art {{followed the same}} pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> not so far from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} Aguilera gearing up and riding a {{motorcycle}} into a nightclub. Wearing a bikini and buttocks-bearing chaps, she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances, accompanied by several back-up dancers. A masked woman is {{lowered into the}} ring, and the two engage in foxy boxing. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a crop top, which she later removes to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds down a hallway, passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and back-up dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals, as a possible reference to urolagnia. It features several sexual fetishes, from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping.|$|E

Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E
5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E
