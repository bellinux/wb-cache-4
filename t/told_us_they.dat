500|$|On December 12, 1990, John Sculley (then Apple CEO) {{introduced}} the Classic {{at a press}} conference, announcing that pricing would start at $1,000 and saying, [...] "To reach new customers, we didn't just lower the prices of our existing products. We redesigned these computers {{from the ground up}} with the features customers have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> value most." [...] Apple's new pricing strategy caused concern among investors, who thought it would reduce profit margins. Brodie Keast, an Apple product marketing manager, said, [...] "We are prepared {{to do whatever it takes}} to reach more people with Macintosh.... The plan is to get as aggressive on price as we need to be." [...] After the release of the Classic, Apple's share price closed at $27.75 per share, down 50cents from October 12, 1990, and far below its previous 12-month high of $50.37.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E
2500|$|Voter {{turnout in}} the eastern city of Jalalabad was low at no more than 20–30%, {{according}} to election observer Tim Fairbank: [...] "A {{lot of people have}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> were afraid to vote, and afraid to have their fingers dipped in ink because of the Taliban's threats." [...] The government, on the other hand, was expected to claim that it was more like 60% in the area.|$|E

6000|$|... "Done?" [...] {{said the}} waterman, in disgust. [...] "Done? He’s ’ad a small lemon, an’ it’s {{got into his}} silly old head. He’s making all this fuss ’cos he wanted to set the pub on fire, an’ they wouldn’t let him. Man ashore <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> belonged to the Good Intent, but I know they’re your men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If there is," [...] Prince Karschoff observed, [...] "one {{can easily}} {{understand}} what Immelan has been at. Prince Shan can command {{the whole of}} Asia. I know {{they are afraid of}} something of the sort in the States. An American who was in the club yesterday <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> had spent over a hundred millions on their west coast fortifications in the last two years." ...|$|E
60|$|However, as {{the white}} man spoke no Portuguese, they could {{understand}} nothing of one another but by signs; but our men made the white man understand that they had white men with them too, at which they said the white man laughed. However, to be short, our men came back, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> were all good friends, and {{in about an hour}} four of our men, two negroes, and the black prince, went to the river-side, where the white man came to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>they</b> {{only had}} one wife, each," [...] she said; [...] "and that even kings are kept to this rule, {{as well as their}} humblest subjects." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{employees}} [...] have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>they</b> did {{not look}} like Rajasthanis and spoke in broken Hindi. In fact they were speaking Bengali, which has again given rise to speculation that the militants were from a Bangladeshi outfit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{not able}} to get off from the bed, and my {{mistress}} much less; and my master was so sick that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not open the cabin-door, or get any account what it was that occasioned such a combustion; nor had we any conversation with the ship's company for two days, they having <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in the ship; and they told us afterwards they thought we had been dead.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. The same {{may be said}} {{concerning}} Jesus Christ, who doubtless loveth and tendereth the honour of his own merits, {{as much as any}} who {{are saved}} by him can do, whether they be in heaven or earth; yet he hath promised a reward to a cup of cold water, or giving of any other alms; and hath further <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>they</b> that do these things, they do lay up treasure in heaven, namely, a reward when their Lord doth come, then to be received by them to their eternal comfort.|$|E
60|$|It {{is to be}} observed, that it {{has been}} the opinion of all the sailors who have navigated those parts of the world, that farther south there are great tracts of undiscovered land; and some have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> have seen them, and have called them by such and such name, as, particularly, the Isles of Solomon, of which yet we can read of nobody that ever went on shore on them, or that could give any account of them, except such as are romantic, and not to be {{depended}} upon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down {{the river}} {{four or five}} miles. The fellows on board <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>they</b> had seen a {{sailboat}} with two men in it beating up the river, and from the description we took the men to be Loring and Gouch." ...|$|R
5000|$|We got {{contacted}} {{by so many}} players who <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>they</b> literally changed the way they played after they {{came back from a}} particularly violent mission and saw that Emily had posted up these disturbed drawings in black crayon ...|$|R
5000|$|We don't {{know any}} better than to imagine that {{emancipation}} {{would result in the}} utter extinction of civilization in the South, because the slave-holders, and those in their interest, have persistently <b>told</b> <b>us</b> ... and <b>they</b> always instance the [...] "horrors of St. Domingo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital, Ralph! that's your sort!" [...] cried Peterkin, who, to my {{surprise}} and great relief, had risen to his feet apparently unhurt, though much dishevelled. He rushed frantically towards the gorge, which the yells of the hogs <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> were now approaching. I had {{made up my mind}} that I would abstain from killing another, as, if Peterkin should be successful, two were more than sufficient for our wants at the present time. Suddenly they all burst forth--two or three little round ones in advance, and an enormous old sow with a drove of hogs at her heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't we {{look quite}} domestic?" [...] she asked of the {{arriving}} company, in her neat English tone, and her rising English inflection. [...] "You know I like this," [...] she added, singling Halleck {{out for her}} remark, and making {{it as if it}} were brilliant. [...] "I like being out of doors, don't you know. But there's one thing I don't like: we weren't able to get a drop of champagne at that ridiculous hotel. They <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> were not allowed to keep 'intoxicating liquors.' Now I call that jolly stupid, you know. I don't know whatever we shall do if you haven't brought something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, {{this was}} true; for tadpoles always become frogs {{when a few}} days old. The {{children}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> had been quite comfortable inside the great fish, but they were now hungry, for young frogs always have wonderful appetites. So Mrs. Frog and I set to work to feed them, and had just finished this pleasant task when your soldiers came to arrest me. I assure your Majesty {{this is the first}} time I have been out of the water for a week. And now, if you will permit me to depart, I will hop back home and see how the youngsters are growing." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{gratitude}} {{they expressed}} for our kindly using {{the two young}} women I have mentioned, was a token of generous principles; and our men <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> that <b>they</b> would have given them whatever they could have asked, that was {{in their power to}} bestow.|$|R

60|$|The cock {{that had}} crowed all night crowed again, hoarsely, {{with a sore}} throat. The miserable cattle looked more wearily miserable, but still were motionless, as sponges that grow {{at the bottom of}} the sea. The convicts were out for air: grinning. Someone <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> were war-deserters. Considering the light in which these people look on war, {{desertion}} seemed to me the only heroism. But the q-b, brought up in a military air, gazed upon them as upon men miraculously alive within the shadow of death. According to her code they had been shot when re-captured. The soldiers had unslung the tarpaulin, their home for the night had melted with the darkness, they were mere fragments of gray transit smoking cigarettes and staring overboard.|$|E
60|$|Here too I find Glasses for the Second Sight, as our Old Women call it. This Second Sight {{has been}} often pretended to in Our Regions, and some Famous Old Wives have <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>they</b> can see Death, the Soul, Futurity, and the Neighbourhood of them, in the Countenance: By this {{wonderful}} Art, these good People unfold strange Mysteries, as under some Irrecoverable Disease, to foretell Death; under Hypocondriack Melancholy, to presage Trouble of Mind; in pining Youth, to predict Contagious Love; and an Hundred other Infallibilities, which never fail {{to be true}} as soon as ever they come to pass, and are all grounded upon the same Infallibility, by which a Shepherd may always know when any one of his Sheep is Rotten, viz. when he shakes himself to pieces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha! So you think, {{my little}} man. But you would soon forget your promise {{if you got}} back into the land-world. For, if people only once found out that you had been up my backstairs, you would have all the fine ladies {{kneeling}} to you, and the rich men emptying their purses before you, and statesmen offering you place and power; and young and old, rich and poor, crying to you, 'Only tell us the great backstairs secret, and we will be your slaves; we will make you lord, king, emperor, bishop, archbishop, pope, if you like--only tell us the secret of the backstairs. For thousands of years we have been paying, and petting, and obeying, and worshipping quacks who <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> had the key of the backstairs, and could smuggle us up them; and in spite of all our disappointments, we will honour, and glorify, and adore, and beatify, and translate, and apotheotise you likewise, on the chance of your knowing something about the backstairs, that we may all go on pilgrimage to it; and, even if we cannot get up it, lie at the foot of it, and cry - ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a public}} address in October 2010 on Al-Aqsa TV, Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Maqri, Head of Moroccan and Algerian Delegation to the Gaza Convoy, stated, {{according}} to a translation published by MEMRI, that [...] "the mujahideen have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>they</b> decided not to defeat the oppressive Jews by gunfire, but instead, by daggers." ...|$|R
6000|$|He and our captain both <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>they</b> felt {{quite sure}} that the boats had either reached the Florida coast or been picked up; for we had cruised very {{thoroughly}} over the course they must have taken. We were a little north of Cape Canaveral when the [...] "Tigris" [...] took fire.|$|R
60|$|I {{forgot to}} relate {{one part of}} the adventure. Before we had got fairly clear of the woods, we fell in with four of Forsyth's men, {{notoriously}} the wickedest corps in the army. These fellows began to crack their jokes {{at the expense of the}} two females, and we came near having a brush with them. When we spoke of our pistols, and of our determination to use them, before we would let our convoy come to harm, these chaps laughed at our pop-guns, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> had such things as 'rifles.' This was true enough, and had we come to broadsides, I make no doubt they would have knocked us over like so many snipes. I began to reason with them, on the impropriety of offending respectable females; and one of the fellows, who was a kind of corporal, or something of that sort, shook my hand, said I was right, and offered to be friends. So we spliced the main-brace, and parted. Glad enough was the lady to be rid of them so easily. In these squalls she would bring up in her tears, and then when all went smooth again, she would break out afresh.|$|E
60|$|We {{found her}} a ship of Bristol bound home from Barbadoes, {{but had been}} blown out of the road at Barbadoes, {{a few days before}} she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that beside the terror of the storm, they were but in an {{indifferent}} case for good artists to bring the ship home; they had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm after the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in which they had lost their masts, as above; they <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>they</b> expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the south-east by a strong gale of wind at N.N.W. the same that blew now, and having no sails to work the ship with, but a main-course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury-foremast, which they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries.|$|E
60|$|Next {{to these}} public things were {{the dreams of}} old women; or, I should say, the {{interpretation}} of old women upon other people's dreams; and these put abundance of people even out of their wits. Some heard voices warning them to be gone, for {{that there would be}} such a plague in London so that the living {{would not be able to}} bury the dead; others saw apparitions in the air: and I must be allowed to say of both, I hope without breach of charity, that they heard voices that never spake, and saw sights that never appeared. But the imagination of the people was really turned wayward and possessed; and no wonder if they who were poring continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures, representations and appearances, which had nothing in them but air and vapor. Here they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> saw a flaming sword held in a hand, coming out of a cloud, with a point hanging directly over the city. There they saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried. And there again, heaps of dead bodies lying unburied and the like, just as the imagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to work upon.|$|E
60|$|They were so {{astonished}} at {{the surprise of}} this, that, as <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> afterwards, <b>they</b> resolved to go all on board again to their ship, {{and let them know}} there, that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched the boat again, and got all of them on board.|$|R
60|$|When our {{passengers}} were released and given another meal (finger-bowls came first this time) <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> what <b>they</b> thought of <b>us</b> and the Board; and, like Vincent, we all marvelled {{how they had}} contrived to extract and secrete so much bitter poison and unrest out {{of the good life}} God gives <b>us.</b> <b>They</b> raged, they stormed, they palpitated, flushed and exhausted their poor, torn nerves, panted themselves into silence, and renewed the senseless, shameless attacks.|$|R
6000|$|By the by, I {{should say}} that [...] "baillie" [...] seems to {{correspond}} to {{what we call a}} member of the city council.
