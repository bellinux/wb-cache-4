5|$|Given that it {{encourages}} individuals to choose spiritual practices {{on the grounds}} of personal preference and thus encourages them <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of {{membership}} or initiation rituals, a Falun Gong practitioner can be anyone who chooses to identify themselves as such. Students participate in the practice and follow its teachings as much or as little as they like, and practitioners do not instruct others on what to believe or how <b>to</b> <b>behave.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{in prison}} Bukovsky and fellow inmate {{psychiatrist}} Semyon Gluzman jointly wrote A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents published in Russian, English, French, Italian, German, Danish. It instructed potential victims of political psychiatry how <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> during interrogation {{in order to}} avoid being diagnosed as mentally ill.|$|E

5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how <b>to</b> <b>behave.</b>|$|E
5|$|As night approaches, the {{brothers}} {{have not been}} able to find Gordon. Dean decides to go after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his reckless behavior since his deal with a Crossroads Demon, which left him only a year to live. Dean claims that he is not scared of his impending death, but Sam challenges this. Dean eventually relents, agreeing <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> more like his old self again. The two then prepare to wait out the night.|$|E

5|$|Creatures of Impulse is a stage {{play by the}} English dramatist W. S. Gilbert, {{with music}} by the composer-conductor Alberto Randegger, which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both the play and the short story concern an {{unwanted}} and ill-tempered old fairy who enchants people <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> in a manner opposite to their natures, with farcical results.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> {{in a way that}} caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E

5|$|In March 2008, the BBC {{announced}} that Larry Lamb had been cast as Archie Mitchell, {{the brother of}} Peggy's late husband Eric. Archie was scripted as a love-interest for Peggy and Peggy's backstory was retconned to incorporate a romantic history with Archie. Portrayed as an adulterous villain, Archie began controlling Peggy, changing her clothing and her hair style and instructing her on how <b>to</b> <b>behave.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{biological}} classification humans are animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{hydroxide}} {{also finds}} {{use as a}} fire retardant filler for polymer applications {{in a similar way}} to magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite. It decomposes at about 180 C, absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour. In addition <b>to</b> <b>behaving</b> as a fire retardant, it is very effective as a smoke suppressant {{in a wide range of}} polymers, most especially in polyesters, acrylics, ethylene vinyl acetate, epoxies, PVC and rubber.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 Bremer {{resigned}} as Director of Ministries after admitting <b>to</b> <b>behaving</b> with poor judgement {{in a conflict}} of interest situation, and Rev. Robert Heerspink replaced him as the organization's leader. In 2006, Back to God reorganized the English language ministry, bringing the Today devotional, Back to God Hour, and Kids Corner under the leadership of Rev. Steven Koster. Back to God also entered a partnership with Words of Hope and FEBA to produce a Specialized English broadcast called Spotlight.|$|R
50|$|At the meeting, the Section C leader Aila Mu {{offers to}} hire Jack as their {{guardian}} {{and tells him}} a disturbing story: After the earthquake occurred, the men of both A and B ran wild, capturing and raping the women until they learned that there was enough food for long-term survival. Many of the worst offenders are current Section A leaders, who would revert <b>to</b> <b>behaving</b> like animals if another disaster occurred. Convinced by Aila Mu's story, Jack agrees to aid Section C.|$|R
5|$|Mike Riley was {{selected}} as the referee for the match; the Yorkshire-based official and England's representative referee at Euro 2004 had sent off five players in his last six games. Such was the concern another brawl would take place, Greater Manchester Police officers spoke to Riley to underline the need for players <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> themselves.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies {{compared}} to certain other eusocial wasps species. Thus, {{it is common}} for the nest to be destroyed, for the queen to die prior {{to the end of the}} season, or for the nest to fail through other means, such as predation, parasitisation, or worker mortality, leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps. Due to this, it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain casteless till adulthood, allowing female wasps’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic. It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present, exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity. Experimentally, this has been found to be true. Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had the eggs and larvae removed. In the experimental group, the wasps began <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens. In the control group, the wasps continued <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> as workers. This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity.|$|E
50|$|Often {{behavioral}} and passive characteristics are combined, for example a prey animal may look similar <b>to</b> and <b>behave</b> like its hunter's own predator (see mimicry).|$|R
50|$|A {{positional}} isomer of androstenol, 3β-androstenol (5α-androst-16-en-3β-ol), is also endogenous to humans (as well as <b>to</b> pigs), <b>behaving</b> as a pheromone {{and contributing to}} axillary odor.|$|R
40|$|Signi cant {{progress}} has been made in the last decade in understanding mixtures of hard-sphere colloids and (smaller) non-adsorbing, ideal, linear polymers. We intro-duce extra complexity into this simple model system by replacing the linear polymers with star-branched polymers with increasing functionality but constant radius of gyration. The observed phase diagrams, interpreted in light of what is known about hard-sphere colloid plus linear polymer and binary-hard-sphere mixtures, suggest that 32 -arm stars are close <b>to</b> <b>behaving</b> hard-sphere-like in colloid{star mixtures at this size ratio...|$|R
5|$|The novel {{begins as}} Sukartono (Tono), a Dutch-trained doctor, {{and his wife}} Sumartini (Tini), {{residents}} of Batavia (modern day Jakarta), are suffering a marital breakdown. Tono is busy treating his patients, leaving no {{time for him to}} be with Tini. In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little time to deal with household work. This further distances Tono from her, as he expects her <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home, with dinner ready, when he returns from work.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners begin <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> like {{soldiers}} around Irwin, using {{code words}} and gestures, infuriating the commandant.

Yates is bribed to inform about Irwin's plans {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} in 1936 by How to be a Detective. The early success of How to Sleep prompted MGM to rush two more short films featuring Benchley, How to Train a Dog, a spoof of dog-training techniques, and How <b>to</b> <b>Behave,</b> which lampooned etiquette norms. How to Sleep was named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards, {{while the latter}} two shorts were not as well received.|$|E

50|$|The Anatomy of Dependence (Amae no Kōzō) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Japanese {{psychoanalyst}} Takeo Doi, discussing at length Doi's concept of amae, {{which he describes}} as a uniquely Japanese {{need to be in}} good favor with, and be able to depend on, the people around oneself. He likens this <b>to</b> <b>behaving</b> childishly in the assumption that parents will indulge you (Doi 2001:16), and claims that the ideal relationship is that of the parent-child, and all other relationships should strive for this degree of closeness (Doi 2001:39).|$|R
