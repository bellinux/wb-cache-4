The research questions examined to what extent state and national <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> perceive differences in the importance to effective teaching and learning across each of Danielson 2 ̆ 7 s 4 domains and across the elements within those domains. A quantitative single-factor within-subject design was utilized. Framework for Teaching Survey importance ratings obtained from state <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> for <b>the</b> past 6 <b>years</b> (N = 350) were compared using repeated measure one-way analysis of variances). Significant F values were followed by the Fisher Least Significant Difference Test to determine the domains or elements that significantly differ from one another. Significant differences in the importance ratings were obtained across each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4 domains. The instruction domain was rated most important followed by classroom environment, planning and preparation, and professional responsibilities. Findings may facilitate positive social change by enabling schools, districts, and states to more accurately evaluate teachers and devote limited professional development resources to domains and elements with the greatest potential for improving teacher quality...|$|R
