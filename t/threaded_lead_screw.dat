50|$|In the {{majority}} of linear actuator designs, the basic principle of operation is that of an inclined plane. The <b>threads</b> of a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> act as a continuous ramp that allows a small rotational force to be used over a long distance to accomplish movement of a large load over a short distance.|$|R
50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> A <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). <b>Threaded</b> onto the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is a <b>lead</b> nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|R

50|$|A traveling-nut linear {{actuator}} has a motor that stays attached to {{one end of}} the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (perhaps indirectly through a gear box), the motor spins the <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> and the <b>lead</b> nut is restrained from spinning so it travels up and down the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|R
50|$|Example: A CNC {{vertical}} mill has {{a vertical}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> on the Z-axis. A low <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 5 {{turns per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.|$|R

40|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives {{are used}} in various motion {{delivery}} systems ranging from manufacturing to high precision medical devices. <b>Lead</b> <b>screws</b> come in many different shapes and sizes; they may be big enough to move a 140 tons theatre stage or small enough {{to be used in}} a 10 ml liquid dispensing micro-pump. Disproportionate to the popularity of <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> and their wide range of applications, very little {{attention has been paid to}} their dynamical behavior. Only a few works can be found in the literature that touch on the subject of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> dynamics and the instabilities caused by friction. The current work aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive study of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> dynamics focusing on the friction-induced instability in such systems. In this thesis, a number of mathematical models are developed for <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive systems. Starting from the basic kinematic model of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and nut, dynamic models are developed with varying number of degrees of freedom to reflect different components of a real <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive from the rotary driver (motor) to the translating payload. In these models, velocity-dependent friction between meshing <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and nut <b>threads</b> constitute the main source nonlinearity. A practical case study is presented where friction-induced vibration in a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive is the cause of excessive audible noise. Using a complete dynamical model of this drive, a two-stage system parameter identification and fine-tuning method is developed to estimate parameters of the velocity-dependent coefficient of friction. In this approach the coupling stiffness and damping in the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> supports are also estimated. The numerical simulation results using the identified parameters show the applicability of the developed method in reproducing the actual systems behavior when compared with the measurements. The verified mathematical model is then used to study the role of various system parameters on the stability of the system and the amplitude of vibrations. These studies lead to possible design modifications that solve the system’s excessive noise problem. Friction can cause instability in a dynamical system through different mechanisms. In this work, the three mechanisms relevant to the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> systems are considered. These mechanisms are: 1. negative damping; 2. kinematic constraint, and; 3. mode coupling. The negative damping instability, which is caused by the negative gradient of friction with respect to sliding velocity, is studied thorough linear eigenvalue analysis of a 1 -DOF <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive model. The first order averaging method is applied to this model to gain deeper insight into the role of velocity-dependent coefficient of friction and to analyze the stability of possible periodic solutions. This analysis also is extended to a 2 -DOF model. It is also shown that higher order averaging methods can be used to predict the amplitude of vibrations with improved accuracy. Unlike the negative damping instability mechanism, kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can affect a system even when the coefficient of friction is constant. Parametric conditions for these instability mechanisms are found through linear eigenvalue analysis. It is shown that kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can only occur in self-locking <b>lead</b> <b>screws.</b> The experimental case study presented in this work demonstrates the need for active vibration control when eliminating vibration by design fails or when it is not feasible. Using the sliding mode control method, two speed regulators are developed for 1 -DOF and 2 -DOF <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive system models where torque generated by the motor is the controlled input. In these robust controllers, no knowledge of the actual value of any of the system parameters is required and only the upper and lower bounds of parameters are assumed to be available. Simulation results show the applicability and performance of these controllers. The current work provides a detailed treatment of the dynamics of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives and the topic of friction-induced vibration in such systems. The reported findings regarding the three instability mechanisms and the friction parameters identification approach can improve the design process of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives. Furthermore, the developed robust vibration controllers can be used to extend the applicability of <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> to cases where persistent vibrations caused by negative damping cannot be eliminated by design modifications due to constraints...|$|R
40|$|A sliding mode {{vibration}} controller for <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives Orang Vahid-Araghi 1 and Farid Golnaraghi 2 The conversion of rotary to translational motion in <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives {{occurs at the}} meshing <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and nut <b>threads.</b> A decreasing coefficient of friction with sliding velocity, may lead to instabilities in these drives. In this paper, a sliding mode controller is designed for a {{two degrees of freedom}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive model.

The wear and fatigue life of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> actuators is a typical multidisciplinary problem. The wear behaviors of actuators closely relate to many factors such as loads, lubrications, materials properties, surface properties, pressures, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. In this paper, the wear and fatigue life of a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> actuator is modeled and validated. Firstly, the theory of asperity contact and Archard’s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under certain circumstances. Secondly, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol, and the wear phenomenon at the ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model.
