5|$|<b>To</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> bridge, Thomas {{would need}} to receive and pay more money, and he did. Along with the {{complete}} repair in 1866, another pier was added to increase {{the stability of the}} weak structure.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} {{took place at}} the bridge over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers due to the hazardous nature of the waterway. In 1960, two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.|$|E

Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E

5|$|Although the Ministry of Education {{reported}} that eleven schools had sustained a combined total of $300,000 of damage, the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities {{reported that}} most of the country's other major infrastructure remained functional.

Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority reported another $922,000 of damage, but none of these sectors experienced prolonged disruptions to their functionality.|$|E

5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{were heavy}} on both sides, and both vessels were in such poor {{condition}} that each commander {{thought he had}} sunk his opponent. Most of La Vengeance rigging had been blown away; only the lower foremast, lower mizzenmast, and bowsprit were operational. Pitot set course for Curaçao {{and was forced to}} ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while accounts from Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once Pitot reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. La Vengeance remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> frigate from the Dutch officials there. A French expedition to seize the island brought the materiel needed <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> frigate, but when asked to help attack the island Pitot refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.|$|E

5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E

After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set off on her maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with Essex to escort merchant ships to the East Indies. Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures. Without the full support of the rigging, all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> main mast.|$|E
