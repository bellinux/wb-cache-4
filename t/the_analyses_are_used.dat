40|$|This article proposes new {{parameters}} for the practical design of circular high-strength concrete (HSC) columns confined with an innovative Steel Strapping Tensioning Technique (SSTT) using a nominal curvature approach. Previous experimental research has proven {{the effectiveness of}} the SSTT at providing active confinement and enhancing the ductility of HSC columns, but to date no practical procedures are available so that the technique can be widely adopted in design practice. The proposed design approach is based on results from segmental analyses of slender SSTT-confined circular columns subjected to eccentric loads. The results obtained from <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to determine the variables governing the design of such columns. The use of the proposed design parameters predicts conservatively the capacity of small-scale slender HSC circular columns confined using the SSTT, and can be thus used in the practical design of reinforced concrete (RC) structures...|$|E
40|$|Bearing {{capacity}} calculations are {{an important}} part of the design of foundations. Most of the terms in the bearing capacity equation, as it is used today in practice, are empirical. Shape factors for square and rectangular footings could not be derived in the past because three-dimensional bearing capacity computations could not be performed with any degree of accuracy. Likewise, depth factors could not be determined because rigorous analyses of foundations embedded in the ground were not available. In this paper, the bearing capacities of strip, square, circular and rectangular foundations in clay are determined rigorously based on finite element limit analysis. The results of <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to propose rigorous, definitive values of the shape and depth factors for foundations in clays. These results are helpful in reducing the uncertainties related to the method of analysis in bearing capacity calculations, paving the way for more cost-effective foundation design...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{semantic}} account of Gifford-style type-and-effect systems. These type systems provide lightweight static analyses annotating program phrases with the sets of possible computational effects they may cause, such as memory access and modification, exception raising, and non-deterministic choice. <b>The</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>used,</b> for example, {{to justify the}} program transformations typically used in optimising com-pilers, such as code reordering and inlining. Despite their existence for over two decades, there is no prior comprehensive theory of type-and-effect systems accounting for their syntax and semantics, and justifying their use in effect-dependent program transformation. We achieve this generality by recourse {{to the theory of}} algebraic effects, a de-velopment of Moggi’s monadic theory of computational effects that emphasises the operations causing the effects at hand and their equational theory. The key observation is that annotation effects can be identified with the effect operations. Our first main contribution is the uniform construction of semantic models for type-and-effect analysis by a process we call conservative restriction. Our construction re...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} paper, our aims are the {{investigation}} {{of the effects of the}} spray parameters of the aluminum-coated layer on the microstructure and mechanical properties. For this purpose, we use the self-generated atmospheric plasma spray system for coating of aluminum on the carbon steel substrate to protect it against corrosion degradation. This system allows us to achieve the best choice for parameters. In this paper, the effects of spray distance and argon flow rate on the characteristics of aluminum coating are investigated. To obtain the results, <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, micro hardness of the coating by Vickers method, and adhesion strength behaviors by pull-off test. The results show that the porosity increases with increasing distance. This phenomenon reduces the hardness and adhesion, which is clearly evident in our results. The other important conclusion is that, if the gas flow rate increases, the porosity decreases. It is shown that the best adhesion strength is obtained at the special value of the spraying distance.|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of single- and double-rivet {{aluminum alloy}} 5754 -O self-piercing riveted (SPR) lap joints {{has been investigated}} experimentally and analytically. With the single rivet, the experimental program involves a set of 27 cyclic tension tests on joints with 1 -, 2 - or 3 -mm-thick sheet coupons. In most cases (85 %), fatigue cracks are found to initiate in the gross section on the faying surface of the upper sheet. With two rivets (installed in two rows), the experimental program consists of nine cyclic tension tests, three {{for each of the}} three combinations of riveting orientation possible, on SPR joints consisting of 2 -mm-thick sheet specimens. The fatigue life of double-rivet joints is found to be strongly dependent on the orientation combination of the rivets. Monotonic tests with the double-rivet joints also reveal an influence of orientation combination. In addition to experiments, values of local stress and rivet-sheet microslip in the single-rivet joints have been evaluated through three-dimensional elastic finite-element analysis. <b>The</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to interpret experimental observations of fatigue crack initiation location, life and fretting damage severity...|$|E
