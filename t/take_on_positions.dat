40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential of}} culturally-responsive environmental education to engage immigrant early adolescents. Our study suggests that environmental involvement can become a means and an end for children to bridge their school and home in agential ways. Drawing from a multi-phase study involving focus groups with children, parents, and teachers from three culturally-diverse schools in Montreal, {{as well as a}} green action research project, we examine children’s role as environmental educators and ambassadors. The role of environmental ambassador allowed children to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>positions</b> that departed from conventional parent-child social scripts, and enhanced the communication between school-student-home, between generations, and spoke to their sense of place. We contend that culturally-responsive environmental education offers a unique space for enacting democracy, knowledge creation and integration, but this opportunity is often squandered. Bi-directional, responsive, and consistent home-school-community-place relations need to be actively supported...|$|E

40|$|Gender {{equity in}} the {{creation}} and enforcement of social norms is important {{not only as a}} normative principle but it can also support long term economic growth. Yet in most societies, coercive power {{is in the hands of}} men. We investigate whether this form of segregation is due to gender differences in the willingness to volunteer for <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>positions</b> of power. In order to study whether potential differences are innate or driven by social factors, we implement a public goods game with endogenous third-party punishment in matrilineal and patriarchal societies in India. Our findings indicate that segregation in coercive roles is due to conformity with pre-assigned gender roles in both cultures. We find that women in the matrilineal society are more willing to assume the role of norm enforcer than men while the opposite is true in the patriarchal society. Moreover, we find that changes in the institutional environment that are associated with a decrease in the exposure and retaliation against the norm enforcer, result in increased participation of the segregated gender. Our results suggest that the organizational environment can be adjusted to increase the representation of women in positions of power, and that it is critical to take the cultural context into account...|$|E
40|$|Tourism is {{promoted}} as a pathway to {{economic and social}} development for Indigenous peoples. However, the development of successful Indigenous tourism businesses in Australia has been limited. Indigenous Australians experience barriers to enterprise development which are broad in nature and range from economic barriers (such as lack of land tenure), to resource barriers (such as lack of training, education and insufficient infrastructure). Researchers for the Harvard Project in the USA report key factors essential to successful Indigenous entrepreneurship. Three of these factors are the ability of the corporation to engage community members, the ability to secure succession, and the ability to establish proper financial and administrative systems. This paper presents results of research in Australia which supports the importance of these three factors. Using an Indigenist research paradigm, the study was conducted over three years, with the members of an Aboriginal Corporation in New South Wales (NSW). The results highlight the need to build organisational and individual capacity development before instigating enterprise development. Particularly, the results presented in this paper show that instigating appropriate forms of governance is essential to encourage participation and cooperation from community members. Secondly, results show that succession is precarious and that further research is required to establish appropriate ways to encourage and enable young people and women to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>positions</b> of responsibility. Finally, the results support the establishment of proper systems of financial governance, not only to encourage external stakeholder confidence, but also to assist the development and empowerment of individual corporation members...|$|E
40|$|M. A. (Counselling Psychology) Abstract: Male on male rape is {{surrounded}} by myths and misconceptions. These misconceptions maintain the invisibility and underreporting of male rape, and they often relate to the masculinity of the male victim. The misconceptions create particular representations, and the media transmits these representations to the public. This qualitative study aimed to explore what was being reported about male rape in South African newspapers. Purposive sampling provided a final sample of 46 press reports from the Sabinet database. The first objective was to describe how male rape was represented within the reportage. Content {{analysis was used to}} explore these representations of male rape using a grounded theory approach. Five main representations of male rape were identified. These included male rape being depicted as a social problem surrounded by shame, stigmatization, and trauma. The pressure of hegemonic masculinity contribute to the shame and stigma. Ideologies informed these social representations, and the reports communicated that social constructions prevent disclosure. Nevertheless, male rape was also represented as a serious crime that deserved legal recognition and justice for victims. Thereafter, the second objective of the study was directed at exploring how the sexuality of the victim was being constructed within the reportage. Discourse analysis addressed this objective, applying the analytic of subject positions to representations of male rape victims in the reports. Four main positions were constructed for male victims of rape; these were influenced by discourses of hegemonic masculinity. Specifically, the discourses of {{what it is to be}} a man limited disclosure because of privileged gendered positions taken on by victims. Victims in the reports <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>positions</b> of compromised masculinity, and therefore become ashamed, stigmatized, and emasculated. The ideological processes that exists within the broader social system maintained these positions. Within the reportage, male rape myths and masculinist ideology were present in the representations and subject positions. However, the reports lacked an activist approach to addressing the social problem of male rape myths. These findings can help media reporting and social interventions by facilitating ideas to address the myths that oppress male victims and maintain the invisibility of male rape. Specifically, misrepresentations that can be addressed include: men cannot be raped, men are unaffected by rape, men should be able to defend against rape, and male rape only occurs in prison...|$|E
