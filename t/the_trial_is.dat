5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is {{the central part of}} the work, and is probably the original account. To the Libellus was added an introduction which summarises St-Calais' career prior to the trial. A conclusion which relates the bishop's life after <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> appended to the end of the work. The introduction and conclusion are often referred to as the Vita, or Life.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, a joint {{application}} {{submitted by}} the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) and the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) {{was approved by the}} Scottish Government allowing for a trial reintroduction of the European beaver to the Knapdale Forest in Mid-Argyll. If <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> successful then the European beaver will be the first mammal to be reintroduced to the United Kingdom. Beavers have been extinct in Scotland since the 16th century, when they were hunted for their pelt, meat and medicinal properties (use of castoreum).|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, {{and the outcome}} is unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E

5|$|Shakur {{was indicted}} on May 30, 1974, on {{the charge of}} having robbed a Brooklyn bar and {{kidnapping}} bartender James E. Freeman for ransom. Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were accused of entering the bar with pistols and shotguns, taking $50 from the register, kidnapping the bartender, leaving a note demanding a $20,000 ransom from the bar owner, and fleeing in a rented truck. Freeman {{was said to have}} later escaped unhurt. The text of Shakur's opening statement in <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> reproduced in her autobiography. Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were acquitted on December 19, 1975 after seven hours of jury deliberation, ending a three-month trial in front of Judge William Thompson.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{authorities}} in Bjelovar announced they would file war crime charges against two unnamed JNA officers. In 2010, Šimić {{was charged with}} war crimes, specifically the killing of prisoners of war. According to the charges filed by the County Court of Bjelovar, Šimić or several persons directly commanded by him killed Kovačević and two other JNA officers after they surrendered on 29 September. , <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> in progress. Four other persons were tried on charges of killing of six prisoners of war captured at the Božidar Adžija Barracks. These prisoners, along with one civilian who had been held in custody since 2 September, {{were taken to the}} Česma Forest near the village of Malo Korenovo to be shot. The soldiers were killed, but the civilian survived, although he sustained severe injuries. The four accused were acquitted in 2012. Škarec and Chief of Staff of Bjelovar TO Stjepan Budimski were charged with disobeying the orders issued by the General Staff, and were imprisoned. After spending several months in custody, Škarec and Budimski were released without formal charges. Škarec was discharged from the Croatian armed forces.|$|E

5|$|When {{attempting}} {{to visit the}} San 'Shyuum home world, the four are captured by Builders, commanded by the Master Builder. The Didact and humans are held prisoner, but Bornstellar is returned {{to the care of}} his father because of his family's status and power. On his family's home world, he uses the time and peace to reflect on recent events, and allow the imprint of the Didact to fully assimilate into his thoughts. He overhears an argument between his father and another Builder, from which he learns that his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such a weapon, hence his exile. It is soon revealed that the Master Builder is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled, but one of the rings had gone missing. Bornstellar is called to a Forerunner core planet to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else. Just as <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> about to begin, an AI, Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and intends to use the combined power of the Halos to begin wiping out the Forerunner race.|$|E
25|$|Following a jury {{selection}} process that lasted three weeks, {{the trial of}} three people {{in connection with the}} disaster began on 2 October 2017.

25|$|If the {{prosecution}} elects not {{to comply with}} the order to produce Jencks Material, the court shall strike the testimony of the witness and continue with the trial. If the interests of justice require such, <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> properly called a mistrial.|$|E

25|$|A {{blind or}} blinded-{{experiment}} is {{an experiment in}} which information about the test is masked (kept) from the participant, to reduce or eliminate bias, until after a trial outcome is known.

If both tester and subject are blinded, <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> called a double-blind experiment.|$|E

25|$|Catriona is Stevenson's 1893 {{sequel to}} Kidnapped. Both novels {{are set in}} the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite Risings, in the mid-18th century. The first part of Catriona recounts the attempts of the hero – David Balfour – to gain justice for James Stewart – James of the Glens – who has been arrested and charged with complicity in the Appin Murder. David makes a statement to a lawyer, and goes on to meet Lord Prestongrange – the Lord Advocate – to press the case for James' innocence. However his attempts fail as he is once again kidnapped and confined on the Bass Rock, until <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> over, and James condemned to death.|$|E
25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> just a rote presentation.|$|E
