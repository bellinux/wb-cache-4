5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural enemies of <b>the</b> <b>gypsy</b> moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although <b>the</b> <b>gypsy</b> moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of <b>the</b> <b>gypsy</b> moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1944, the SS cleared <b>the</b> <b>Gypsy</b> camp. A {{witness in}} another part of the camp later told of the Gypsies unsuccessfully battling the SS with improvised weapons before being loaded into trucks. The {{surviving}} population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers. The murder of the Romani people by the Nazis during World War II is known in the Romani language as the Porajmos (devouring).|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, the Sadler's Wells {{company made}} a 78 r.p.m. set of {{excerpts}} from Simon Boccanegra (1949), but made no more recordings until the stereo LP era. In the 1950s and 1960s, the company recorded {{a series of}} abridged sets of operas and operettas for EMI, each occupying two LP sides. All were sung in English. The opera sets were Madame Butterfly (1960), Il trovatore (1962), and Hansel and Gretel (1966). The abridged operetta recordings were Die Fledermaus (1959), The Merry Widow (1959), The Land of Smiles (1960), La vie parisienne (1961), Orpheus in the Underworld (1960), Iolanthe (1962), La belle Hélène (1963) and <b>The</b> <b>Gypsy</b> Baron (1965). A complete recording of The Mikado was released in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale blood {{was added to}} the Irish draught breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} in the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Gypsy</b> Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other draught breeds, was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse. In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, <b>the</b> <b>Gypsy</b> women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gypsy</b> Restaurant and Velvet Lounge was a {{restaurant}} and nightclub established in 1947 and located along Northwest 21st Avenue in the Northwest District neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Popular with young adults, the restaurant was known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, for its 1950s furnishings, and for hosting karaoke, trivia competitions and goldfish racing tournaments. The restaurant {{is said to have}} influenced local alcohol policies; noise complaints and signs of drunken behavior by patrons made the business a target for curfews and closure. Concept Entertainment owned the restaurant from 1992 until 2014, when it was closed unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners {{received}} a hot {{drink in the}} morning, but no breakfast, and a thin meatless vegetable soup at noon. In the evening they {{received a}} small ration of moldy bread. Most prisoners saved some of the bread for the following morning. Nyiszli notes the daily intake did not exceed 700 calories, except for prisoners being subjected to live medical experimentation, who were better fed and clothed. Sanitary arrangements were poor, with inadequate latrines {{and a lack of}} fresh water. In Auschwitz II-Birkenau, latrines were not installed until 1943, two years after camp construction began. The camps were infested with vermin such as disease-carrying lice, and the inmates suffered and died in epidemics of typhus and other diseases. Noma, a bacterial infection occurring among the malnourished, was a common cause of death among children in <b>the</b> <b>Gypsy</b> camp.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. <b>The</b> <b>gypsy</b> moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E

5|$|After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl {{began work}} on the movie she had {{tried and failed to}} direct once before, namely Tiefland. On Hitler's direct order, the German {{government}} paid her seven million Reichsmarks in compensation. From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942. This time Sinti and Roma people from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras. Almost to the end of her life, despite overwhelming evidence that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war. Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of <b>the</b> <b>Gypsy</b> survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming. The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to Auschwitz after filming was completed.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the film}} was set in Istanbul, Turkey. Locations {{included}} the Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia and the Sirkeci railway station which also {{was used for the}} Belgrade and Zagreb railway stations. The MI6 office in London, SPECTRE Island, the Venice hotel and the interior scenes of the Orient Express were filmed at Pinewood Studios with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey and the truck ride were shot in Argyll, Scotland and Switzerland. The end scenes for the film were shot in Venice. However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent {{of the film}} had to have been filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth. <b>The</b> <b>Gypsy</b> camp was also to be filmed in an actual camp in Topkapi, but was actually shot in a replica of it in Pinewood. The scene with rats (after the theft of the Lektor) was shot in Spain, as Britain did not allow filming with wild rats, and an attempt filming white rats painted in cocoa in Turkey did not work. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963, and wrapped on 23 August. Ian Fleming spent a week in the Istanbul shoot, supervising production and touring the city with the producers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my essay is to analyse the antiziganism {{imparted}} by the Swedish Governement during the 1930 ´s and 1940 ´s. The starting points are {{the text in}} the first published chapter of the Governement´s White Paper and other political texts refered to concerning surveys of <b>the</b> <b>gypsies.</b> My sources will be these texts important for the time period of my essay. The White Paper recites in chronological order for the repeatedly made surveys and registrations of <b>the</b> <b>gypsies</b> made by <b>the</b> authorities during the 1900 ´s. My analysis will apply the theories of Michel Foucault being about biopower/biopolitics and the method for ideological analysis by Sven-Eric Liedman. I have shown how the Swedish Governement instituted a number of excluding measures on <b>the</b> <b>gypsies.</b> <b>The</b> Governement defined <b>the</b> <b>gypsies,</b> as a deviant and lower class race, entirely separate from the pure Swedish race. I have shown the Governement´s interest in spreading “antiziganism” to other citizens and its willingness to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>gypsies</b> by forced sterilisation and forced fostering of their children. “Swedish” standards were set by the Governement and, through these standards the police found substantial grounds to keep records of particular individual gypsies and to share this information between and outside authorities. I have in my analysis defined and shown that the Governement´s ideology was nationalism, regardless of party in governmental power. The Swedish Governement regarded <b>the</b> <b>gypsies</b> as a danger, a peculiar sort of danger, that should be combated and “antiziganism” was the weapon...|$|R
