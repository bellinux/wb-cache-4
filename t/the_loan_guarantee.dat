Several weeks before becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion-dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a loan guarantee for Muskrat Falls. <b>The</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> would reduce the cost of the project by millions, resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers. Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development. During a campaign stop in St. John's during the 2011 federal election Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his Conservative Party while Harper committed to <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee.</b> On August 19, 2011, Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced a Memorandum of Agreement for <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee.</b> While Oliver stated <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> would be in place by the end of November 2011, it was not until November 30, 2012 that <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> was finalized.
