40|$|Abstract Every GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) phone, {{also called}} 2 G mobile phone and every UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) phone, aka 3 G mobile phone {{requires}} a smart card to connect and {{function in the}} mobile network. This smart card is called SIM, which stands for Subscriber Identity Module. In fact, this module contains the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and credentials that are necessary for the identification and authentication of the subscriber. Without the SIM the user {{will not be allowed}} to connect to the mobile network and hence not able to make or receive phone calls. As a smart card the SIM is a <b>tampered</b> <b>resistant</b> microprocessor card with its own operating system, storage and built-in security features that prevent unauthorized individual to access, retrieve, copy or modify the subscriber IMSI and credentials. Abuses of subscriber’s account and fraudulent accesses to the mobile network can hence be avoided. Furthermore, as a removable and autonomous module the SIM introduces great flexibility since the user can easily move the SIM to other mobile phones or replace a SIM with another one. So far, the smart card and its content, the SIM are bound together and called SIM. With the advances in wireless and storage technology, new demands have arisen. Because of cumbersome task of opening machines and installing the removable SIM, the M 2 M applications are designed with pre-installed SIM application. The M 2 M applications based on the cellular networks with the ability of installing the user subscription have advantages and disadvantages for a certain stakeholder. This master’s thesis provides the multiple alternative solutions to this installation and also describe the SIM evolutions i. e. eUICC and soft SIM to give a comprehensive view of the SIM’s situation. The thesis also presents the security assessment of these evolutions which are different with the current removable SIM. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{location}} of mobile devices {{has become an}} important factor. Mobile device users can easily access various customized applications from the service providers based on the current physical location information. Nonetheless, it is a significant challenge in distributed architectures for users to prove their presence at a particular location in a privacy-protected and secured manner. So far, researchers have proposed multiple schemes to implement a secure location proof collection mechanism. However, such location proof schemes are subject to <b>tampering</b> and not <b>resistant</b> to collusion attacks. Additionally, the location authority providing a location proof {{is assumed to be}} honest at all times. In this paper, we present the fundamental requirements of any location proof generation scheme, and illustrate the potential attacks possible in such non-federated environments. Based on our observations, we introduce a concept of witness oriented endorsements, and describe a collusion-resistant protocol for asserted location proofs. We provide an exhaustive security analysis of the proposed architecture, based on all possible collusion models among the user, location authority, and witness. We also present a prototype implementation and extensive experimental results to adjust different threshold values and illustrate the feasibility of deploying the protocol in regular devices for practical use...|$|R

5000|$|The {{paper tape}} {{canister}} is a <b>tamper</b> <b>resistant</b> container {{from which the}} contents may be manually dispensed, but which prohibits reinsertion of a tape once removed. It was used to securely distribute cryptographic keys. Distributing cryptographic keys in the open left the keys vulnerable. [...] "Putting tape in canisters solved {{a lot of the}} security problem by narrowing the vulnerability to the point of use rather than the whole time in inventory", said Whitfield Diffie. The canister was invented to prevent the ability to tamper with the paper tape once placed inside the canister. One of the primary users of the Paper Tape Canister was the National Security Agency. The NSA needed the ability to transfer crytographic keys in a way that clearly showed if the keys had been compromised.|$|E
5000|$|A drain {{is defined}} as {{plumbing}} fitting installed on the suction side of a pump in a pool, spa or hot tub. Drains are now required to be [...] "unblockable." [...] This term has previously been defined in the [...] "definitions" [...] section. Four main ways of keeping a drain from being blockable are outlined as: large aspect covers, long channels, large outlet grates and circulation designs that do not include fully submerged suction outlets. In the United States, if a pool or spa does not employ an unblockable drain, it must include, at a minimum, {{one of the following}} safety systems: a safety vacuum release system (SVRS) as defined in [...] "definitions,' a suction limiting vent system with a <b>tamper</b> <b>resistant</b> atmospheric opening, a gravity drainage system that utilizes a collector tank, an automatic pump shut-off system, a device or system that disables the drain or any other system certified by the consumer product safety commission.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} of automated code obfuscation {{that have made}} it popular and widely useful across many platforms. On some platforms (such as Java., Android, and [...]NET) a free tool called decompiler can easily reverse-engineer source code from an executable or library. A main advantage of automated code obfuscation is that it helps protect the trade secrets (intellectual property) contained within software by making reverse-engineering a program difficult and economically unfeasible. Other advantages might include helping to protect licensing mechanisms and unauthorized access, and shrinking {{the size of the}} executable. Note that not always one can have <b>tamper</b> <b>resistant</b> hardware to conceal secrets in code and secret data, hence one will employ obfuscation to make reversing the code and finding the secret hard. In these scenarios the end user gets a version of the software, and this same user is the adversary. The attack was therefore called `MATE: Man-at-the-End' attack, based on the traditional cryptographic attack known as MITM: Man-in-the-middle attack.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{had been}} {{thought that it}} is {{difficult}} to provide receiptfreeness in mixnet-based electronic voting schemes. Any kind of user chosen randomness can be used to construct a receipt, since a user can prove to a buyer how he had encrypted the ballot. In this paper we propose a simple and efficient method to incorporate receipt-freeness in mixnetbased electronic voting schemes by using the well known re-encryption technique and designated verifier re-encryption proof (DVRP). In our scheme a voter has to prepare his encrypted ballot through a randomization service provided by a <b>tamper</b> <b>resistant</b> randomizer (TRR), in such a way that he finally loses his knowledge on randomness. This method can be used in most mixnet-based electronic voting scheme to provide receipt-freeness. Keywords.
