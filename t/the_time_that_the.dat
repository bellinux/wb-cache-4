5|$|A 2013 book {{researched}} by James Taylor counters {{the popular}} {{belief that the}} Leete design was an influential recruitment tool during the war. He claims the original artwork was acquired by the Imperial War Museum in 1917 and catalogued as a poster in error. Though the image of Kitchener (Britain's most popular soldier) inspired several other poster designs, Taylor says he can find no evidence in photographs of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Leete poster was used, although a photograph from 15 December 1914 taken at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway station in Liverpool clearly depicts Leete's depiction among other recruiting posters.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 10 U.S. {{aircraft}} {{were shot down}} by anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine. In total, the U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft machine-gunned Japanese survivors floating in the water. Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the Japanese destroyers during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water.|$|E

50|$|For trips into largely {{arbitrary}} Earth orbits, {{no specific}} launch time is required.

5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals {{that there was little}} to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Normans conquered England in 1066, {{the town}} of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking {{the mouth of the}} River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States entered World War II in 1941, oil was a {{vital part}} of {{military}} operations around the world. The United States produced 60 percent of the world's crude oil, with the state of Texas in the south-west leading this production, producing {{more than twice as much}} crude as any other state. The industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3,500 smaller operators.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opening {{phases of}} the East Timor {{operation}} began in 1999, the issue regarding {{the purpose of the}} Army Reserve still had not been resolved. Instead of being able to provide formed units to augment the Regular Army, the Reserves was reduced to providing individuals for round-out purposes only. As a result, in the initial phase of the operation there were only 100 Reservists available to fill positions in INTERFET, mostly in specialist roles that the Regular Army had trouble providing. As the deployment progressed to a second rotation in April 2000, however, a further 630 Reservists volunteered for full-time service.|$|E

In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk. It also participated in Operation Northern Watch, helping to patrol the No-Fly Zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq. During the 11 September attacks, the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.|$|E

5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, around <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mark Foley scandal {{broke in}} 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to bring the}} charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated Press on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's allegation at the time, and Hastert denied the accusation to ABC News at the time, so the claim was not published.|$|E

She soon met Charles Baeyertz, a bank manager at the Richmond branch of National Bank of Australasia and a practising Anglican.

5|$|Many academics, {{including}} William Holdsworth, a man {{considered to}} be one of the best legal academics in history, maintain that this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching at all the Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as Sir Edward Coke remarked at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quality of education at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this down to three things—the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, {{has concluded that}} the sand devil and the Pacific angel shark (S. californica) are sister species. The {{two of them in}} turn form a clade with other angel sharks found in the Americas. Molecular clock estimation has timed the divergence of S. dumeril and S. californica at c. 6.1 Ma, around <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Isthmus of Panama formed. The rise of the Isthmus likely split the ancestral angel shark population, leading to their becoming separate species.|$|E
5|$|The 1940 film Florian stars two Lipizzan stallions. It {{was based}} on a 1934 novel written by Felix Salten.

5|$|The Floridas {{were the}} third of 10 {{separate}} classes built between 1906 and 1919, a total of 22 battleships being commissioned.

American capital ship design was also heavily influenced by war games conducted at the US Navy's Naval War College.
