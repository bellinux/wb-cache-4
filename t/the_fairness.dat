40|$|It is {{well known}} that IEEE 802. 11 based MAC {{provides}} max-min fairness to all nodes even in a multi-rate WLAN. However, <b>the</b> max-min <b>fairness</b> may not always be <b>the</b> preferred <b>fairness</b> criteria as it significantly reduces overall system throughput. In this paper, we explore <b>the</b> proportional <b>fairness</b> and <b>the</b> time <b>fairness.</b> First, we obtain a condition that must be satisfied by the attempt probabilities to achieve proportional fairness. Using this condition, we propose a stochastic approximation based on-line algorithm that tunes attempt probabilities to achieve proportional <b>fairness.</b> <b>The</b> proposed algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion, and can provide optimal performance even when node uses a rate adaptation scheme. Next, we show that <b>the</b> time <b>fairness</b> is a special case of weighted max-min <b>fairness</b> with <b>the</b> weight for a node is equal to its transmission rate. Thus, the existing algorithms to achieve weighted max-min fairness can be used to achieve time fairness as well. This exposition also demonstrates that <b>the</b> proportional <b>fairness</b> and <b>the</b> time <b>fairness</b> are not <b>the</b> same contrary to what was conjectured. Performance comparison of various fairness criteria is done through ns- 3 simulations. Simulation results show that time fair schemes achieve the highest throughput, and the sum of logarithm of individual node's throughputs under <b>the</b> time <b>fairness</b> is close to that under a proportionally fair scheme...|$|R

5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed.

This aroused disquiet and objections against <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign.

The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny.
