For property law to perform its coordination function, the rights must be well-defi ned and supplied with a full set of rules (specifications) for their creation, enforcement and termination. As the development of fully specifi ed new property rights is costly, Australian legislators are embracing a shorthand method which relies on contractual specifi cation of the rights by private parties, and empowers them to bind their successors in title.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the unique transition of the German Alliance-Mission (GAM) from an interdenominational faith mission to a denominational church mission agency. This process was begun and {{developed by the}} affiliation on the Federation of Free Evangelical Churches in Germany (FFEC). The GAM was in the beginning stage an intentionally interdenominational mission agency. Their founding fathers Carl Polnick and Fredrik Franson were against denominationalism. Therefore they could not imagine approaching one particular denomination to work together. However, in the 1920 's the GAM became more denominationally minded through {{the influence of the}} new mission leaders. After World War II the leaders of GAM and FFEC began to negotiate about cooperation. In 1960 the FFEC leaders asked their individual congregations to support the GAM only.

2500|$|In 1797, Ali Pasha, the Muslim Albanian {{ruler of}} the Ottoman Pashalik of Yanina, led a raid on the town of Himarë because they {{supported}} his enemy, the Souliotes, and more than 6,000 civilians were slaughtered. Two years later, Ali Pasha tried to create {{good relations with the}} Himariotes after declaring their enclave part of his emerging semi-independent state, by financing various public works and churches. A church he built near Himarë, opposite of the Porto Palermo (Panormos) Castle is the largest and most magnificent in the region and still stands today as a major tourist attraction. [...] Ali Pasha's rule over Himarë lasted about 20 years until it was abruptly terminated by his murder {{at the hands of the}} Ottoman agents. Himarë subsequently reverted to its status quo ante of an enclave surrounded by Ottoman territory. To emphasize the region's special status, the terms that the Himariotes had reached with Suleiman the Magnificent were inscribed on bronze tablets at the request of their leaders, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>record</b> the <b>agreement</b> on a durable medium.

5000|$|Satellite Spies was an Auckland {{rock band}} formed in December 1984 {{as a vehicle}} for the songs of singer/bassist Mark Loveys. Their early life was as Loveys' former band, Blasé, that Glyn Tucker Jnr began {{mentoring}} and developing in 1983 after Loveys booked Mandrill Studios <b>to</b> <b>record</b> some song demos. Tucker was impressed and in 1984 released two Blasé singles on his Reaction label : “Rock Solid” and “Just Like the Old Days”. He continued <b>to</b> <b>record</b> several demos tracks of Lovey's new songs throughout 1984 (one of which was “Destiny in Motion”), but Blasé was eventually judged to be a weak name, and so a name change was agreed. Deane Sutherland (aka Tommy Joy) was invited to join Loveys and so Satellite Spies was born and signed a <b>recording</b> <b>agreement</b> as a duo with Tucker's Reaction Records on 1 January 1985.|$|R

Among other things, ZTT believed that as a departing member of FGTH, Johnson was required to release all solo material through the label until the band's original multiple-album agreement was fulfilled. The suit was bitterly fought, exposing {{the inner workings of the}} ZTT/Frankie machine to a giddy UK music press.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{measurements}} of velocity vs pressure and of bulk density, porosity, matrix density, and magnetic susceptibility in 18 core plugs from CRP- 1. Comparison of our bulk densities with continuous whole-core density records shows very good agreement. Core-plug {{measurements of}} matrix density permit {{conversion of the}} whole-core density <b>record</b> <b>to</b> porosity. <b>Agreement</b> between our magnetic susceptibility measurements and the continuous, whole-core data is excellent. In contrast, our atmospheric pressure measurements of P-wave velocity are ~ 10 % faster than whole-core data obtained at the same pressure. Our measurements of velocity versus pressure indicate that in situ P-wave velocities are probably only 1 - 3 % higher than those measured at atmospheric pressure. Although the Miocene section has undergone significant exhumation, we do not observe typical exhumation signatures of anomalously low initial velocities followed by microcrack closing as pressure is increased. Instead, velocity response to pressure appears {{to be dominated by}} a small amount of post-exhumation cementation...|$|R
