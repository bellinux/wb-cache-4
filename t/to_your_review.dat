6000|$|Well, dear Mr. Chorley, it was {{not your}} doing. So the thing that 'vexed me enough' in you was a mistake of mine. Let us forgive one another our mistakes; and there, an end. I was wrong in taking for granted that the letter which {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>review</b> was entrusted to you to dispose of; and you were not right in being in too much haste to condemn a book you disliked to give the due measure of attention to every page of it. The insurgents being plainly insurgents, you shot one at least of them without trial, as was done in Spain the other day. True, that even favorable critics have fallen here and there into your very mistake; but is not that mainly attributable to the suggestive power of the 'Athenæum,' do you not believe so yourself?

40|$|My {{submission}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>review</b> of the EPBC Act {{focuses on}} a case study involving water pollution and loss of biodiversity in a high conservation value river within the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. Issues that emerged from this case study relate to: The need for the EPBC Act to address existing problems, not just proposed actions. Importance of thorough assessment of proposed actions under the EPBC Act. This includes consideration of flow-on effects, over time, in a total catchment context. Ensuring that the EPBC Act reflects Commonwealth commitments made to UNESCO in world heritage area submissions. Greater scrutiny from Commonwealth of downstream effects of mining, generally from water pollution to high conservation value waterways. Operation, closure and rehabilitation of mines should all be activities that are addressed under the EPBC Act if they are considered to have a potential impact on world heritage area or other high conservation value waterways. All Australian rivers should be classed as matters of national significance. I would be very happy to provide more information, if required. The issues that I have raised in this submission are not isolated to the Grose River and the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, but are relevant across Australia. Many human activities generate adverse impacts for downstream waterways and their biodiversity. Mining, in particular, is an activity that generates enormous wealth for the nation, and creates numerous conflicts of interest for local and state governments. Greater Commonwealth involvement is required. Mining often creates permanent water quality problems during and after its short life of active operation. There are many ‘Grose Rivers ’ across Australia. The Australia-wide expansion of mining will ensure that EPBC Act will frequently need to consider impacts on catchments and waterways of national significance. All Australian rivers and streams need to be protected as matters of national significance...|$|E

In practice this was a score out of 9, since no game ever received a perfect 10, on the rationale that a better game could come along at a later date. After the name change to Joystick Jury, games were judged by each individual reviewer to be either a hit or a miss (in the manner of television show Juke Box Jury, after which it was named). The hit and miss system was abandoned with Issue 19, and with the transition <b>to</b> <b>Your</b> Sinclair, the <b>review</b> section was renamed Screen Shots.
