This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity.

50|$|An {{inrush current}} limiter is a {{component}} used to limit inrush current to avoid gradual damage to components and avoid blowing fuses or tripping circuit breakers. Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) <b>thermistors</b> and fixed resistors {{are often used}} to limit inrush current. NTC <b>thermistors</b> {{can be used as}} inrush-current limiting devices in power supply circuits when added in series with the circuit being protected. They present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on. As current continues to flow, NTC <b>thermistors</b> heat up, allowing higher current flow during normal operation. NTC <b>thermistors</b> are usually much larger than measurement type <b>thermistors,</b> and are purposely designed for power applications.|$|R

25|$|With PTC <b>thermistors,</b> {{resistance}} {{increases as}} temperature rises. PTC <b>thermistors</b> are commonly installed {{in series with}} a circuit, and used to protect against overcurrent conditions, as resettable fuses.|$|R
25|$|The {{dissipation}} constant is {{a measure}} of the thermal connection of the <b>thermistor</b> to its surroundings. It is generally given for the <b>thermistor</b> in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass bead <b>thermistor</b> are 1.5mW/°C in still air and 6.0mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a <b>thermistor</b> may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the <b>thermistor</b> may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the <b>thermistor.</b>|$|E
25|$|So-called self-resetting fuses use a {{thermoplastic}} conductive element {{known as}} a Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient (or PPTC) <b>thermistor</b> that impedes the circuit during an overcurrent condition (by increasing device resistance). The PPTC <b>thermistor</b> is self-resetting in that when current is removed, the device will cool and revert to low resistance. These devices are often used in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult, or on a computer motherboard so that a shorted mouse or keyboard does not cause motherboard damage.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>thermistor</b> is a silistor, a {{thermally}} sensitive silicon resistor. Silistors employ silicon as the semiconductive component material. Unlike ceramic PTC thermistors, silistors have {{an almost}} linear resistance-temperature characteristic.|$|E

25|$|A <b>thermistor</b> {{is a type}} of {{resistor}} with {{electrical resistance}} inversely proportional to its temperature. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. The thermosistor was invented by Samuel Ruben in 1930.|$|E
25|$|Because early {{thermistors}} {{were difficult}} to produce and applications for the technology were limited, commercial production of thermistors did not begin until the 1930s. A commercially viable <b>thermistor</b> was invented by Samuel Ruben in 1930.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamics}} of PTC thermistors being powered also is extremely useful. When first {{connected to a}} voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the <b>thermistor</b> self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. They are also used in the degaussing circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions where the degaussing coil only has to be connected in series with an appropriately chosen thermistor; a particular advantage is that the current decrease is smooth, producing optimum degausing effect. Improved degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the <b>thermistor</b> further (and reduce the final current) or timed relays to disconnect the degaussing circuit entirely after it has operated.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{thick film}} NTC <b>thermistors</b> provide {{a number of}} {{advantages}} over discrete <b>thermistors,</b> including low physical profile, ease of integration, and economy. However, they are inferior with respect to temperature sensitivity, particularly at low ohmic values, {{and it is not}} practical to obtain tight resistance distribution by laser trimming. This paper introduces a new series of thick film pastes, which are capable of producing NTC effects when they are printed and fired between two parallel plates, the same way that thick film capacitors are fabricated. Built in this manner, the new materials provide Beta coefficients that are 40 % to 300 % higher than those of standard thick film <b>thermistors</b> with comparable resistance value. It is in particular much easier to produce low ohm <b>thermistors</b> with high Beta in small areas, a feature that is very useful in building temperature compensated microwave attenuators. It is also much easier to incrementally laser trim these <b>thermistors</b> by cutting a portion of the termination...|$|R

25|$|Thermistors {{differ from}} {{resistance}} temperature detectors (RTDs) {{in that the}} material used in a <b>thermistor</b> is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while thermistors typically achieve a greater precision within a limited temperature range, typically −90°C to 130°C.|$|E

25|$|A <b>thermistor</b> {{is a type}} of {{resistor}} whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor.

25|$|Many {{electric}} motors and dry type power transformers incorporate PTC thermistors in their windings. When {{used in conjunction}} with a monitoring relay they provide overtemperature protection to prevent insulation damage. The equipment manufacturer selects a <b>thermistor</b> with a highly non-linear response curve where resistance increases dramatically at the maximum allowable winding temperature, causing the relay to operate.|$|E

25|$|Chemical {{production}} and petroleum refineries will usually employ computers for logging and for limit testing the many temperatures {{associated with a}} process, typically numbering in the hundreds. For such cases, a number of thermocouple leads {{will be brought to}} a common reference block (a large block of copper) containing the second thermocouple of each circuit. The temperature of the block is in turn measured by a <b>thermistor.</b> Simple computations are used to determine the temperature at each measured location.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} a sail or balloon tip {{modification}} of Ronald Bradley's simple portex tubing method came about from Swan's observation from the Laguna Beach CA shore of sail boats on the water on a relatively calm day. Boats with conventional slot sails were still; one with a spinnaker {{was able to make}} reasonable headway. The concept of using thermodilution to measure cardiac output was originally the idea of Arnost Fronek. As a former colleague of Fronek, Ganz added the <b>thermistor</b> modification after Swan showed him the initial balloon design, which was fabricated by Edwards Laboratories, which had previously contracted with Swan as a consultant.|$|E
25|$|The {{historically}} significant Swan-Ganz multi-lumen catheter allows reproducible {{calculation of}} cardiac output from a measured time-temperature curve, {{also known as}} the thermodilution curve. <b>Thermistor</b> technology enabled the observations that low CO registers temperature change slowly and high CO registers temperature change rapidly. The degree of temperature change is directly proportional to the cardiac output. In this unique method, three or four repeated measurements or passes are usually averaged to improve accuracy. Modern catheters are fitted with heating filaments that intermittently heat up and measure the thermodilution curve, providing serial Q measurements. These instruments average measurements over 2–9 minutes depending on the stability of the circulation, and thus do not provide continuous monitoring.|$|E
25|$|As an {{inrush current}} limiter device in power supply circuits, they present a higher {{resistance}} initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation.
