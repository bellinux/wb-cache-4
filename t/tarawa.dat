5|$|The {{battle of}} <b>Tarawa</b> {{commenced}} on 20 November. In her first offensive {{action of the}} war, Marylands guns opened fire at 05:00, destroying a shore battery with five salvos on the southwestern point of Betio Island in the <b>Tarawa</b> Atoll. At 06:00 she commenced a scheduled shore bombardment to soften up Japanese defenses ahead of the landings. Maryland moved closer to shore to attract Japanese fire and locate artillery emplacements, in the process raking Japanese gun emplacements, control stations, pillboxes and any Japanese installations she could spot. At 09:00 as Marine landing forces encountered heavy Japanese resistance and began taking casualties to emplaced crossfire, Maryland provided covering fire to eliminate several Japanese machine gun nests. Her scouting plane then began to cover {{the progress of the}} Marines' assault, with Maryland providing artillery support. The plane was damaged and pilot wounded in this action.|$|E

The celebration, broadcast by satellite worldwide, had an estimated audience of up to one billion viewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 20 November. Radford's force was occupied with air strikes on Japanese ground targets, and faced frequent attack by Japanese aircraft in night combat, which U.S. aircrews were not well prepared or equipped for. He improvised a unit to counter Japanese night raids, {{and was later}} credited with establishing routines for nighttime combat air patrols to protect carriers; these were adopted fleetwide. He commanded Carrier Division Eleven around <b>Tarawa</b> for several more days, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|After the United States officially {{entered the}} war, Hispanic Americans {{were among the}} many American {{citizens}} who {{joined the ranks of}} the United States Marine Corps as volunteers or through the draft. Hispanic Americans in the Marines fought in every major battle in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The battles of Guadalcanal, <b>Tarawa,</b> Saipan, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa saw fierce fighting between U.S. Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army. Among them PFC Guy Gabaldon who single-handed captured over 1,000 prisoners. It was during this conflict that four Hispanics would also participate as military commanders in the Marine Corps. The two highest-ranking Hispanics in the Marines were Lieutenant General Pedro Augusto del Valle, the first Hispanic to reach the grade of general in the Marines, and Colonel Jaime Sabater, Sr..|$|E

50|$|Kiribati {{receives}} {{development aid}} from the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, USA, the Asian Development Bank, UN agencies and Taiwan. In recent years it has accounted for 20-25% of Kiribati's GDP. Recent projects and notable inputs by the EU have included telecommunications (improvement of telephone exchanges and provision of radio and navigation equipment), the development of seaweed as an export crop, solar energy systems for the outer islands, the upgrading of the Control Tower and fire fighting services at <b>Tarawa's</b> Bonriki International Airport, outer island social development, health services and extensive support for the Kiribati Vocational Training Programme. Additionally, Cuba provides doctors, as well as scholarships for I-Kiribati medical students.|$|R
5|$|Born in Indiana to {{an impoverished}} family, Shoup joined the {{military}} for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. He was unexpectedly given command of the 2nd Marines, and led the initial invasion of <b>Tarawa,</b> for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Order. He served in the Marianas campaign, and later became a high-level military logistics officer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of World War II, Colorado {{undertook}} a defensive patrol near the Golden Gate Bridge in May 1942 to stop a possible Japanese invasion. She then sailed to Fiji to stop any further Japanese advance into the Pacific. Next, she supported the landings on <b>Tarawa,</b> the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Tinian. On 24 July 1944, during the shelling of Tinian, Colorado received 22 shell hits from shore batteries, but continued to support the invading troops until 3 August. She later arrived in Leyte Gulf on 20 November 1944 to support American troops fighting ashore. On 27 November, she was hit by two Kamikazes which caused moderate damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Maryland {{changed her}} base of {{operations}} to Pearl Harbor. She was present at Battleship Row along Ford Island during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Damaged during the attack, Maryland reported to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she was repaired and modernized. Maryland supported the amphibious landings during the Battle of <b>Tarawa,</b> and thereafter participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle of Peleliu, the Philippines Campaign, and the Battle of Okinawa. Following the end of World War II Maryland participated in Operation Magic Carpet before decommissioning in 1947. She was sold for scrap in 1959.|$|E
5000|$|... 2/23 {{pushed forward}} into Iraq on March 20, 2003. Among other locations, the {{battalion}} fought in An Nasiriyah assisting Task Force <b>Tarawa's</b> operations {{in that area}} after a U.S. Army convoy was ambushed and several soldiers were taken prisoner by insurgent forces. The battalion moved up Route 17 as part of Regimental Combat Team 1 (RCT-1) fighting in Al Gharraf and Al Fajr among other towns. The battalion suffered its only combat fatality in Al Fajr. The battalion continued north with RCT 1 and {{was part of the}} tactical feint at Al Kut. Ultimately traveling west to An Numaniyah where the 1st Marine Division crossed the Tigris River. A few days later, on April 8, 2003, the battalion entered Baghdad with the Division. Fox Company found itself engaged in combat with approximately 200 Fedayeen and Iraqi intelligence personnel. A scout sniper attached to Fox company, Sergeant Scott Montoya, was awarded Navy Cross for [...] "extraordinary heroism in combat" [...] during this engagement. The next day Golf company moved to secure the Iraqi intelligence headquarters from which Fox Company had been attacked the previous day. Once Baghdad was largely secure, Golf Company and an anti-tank section from Weapons Company became part of Task Force Tripoli, which was the Marine vanguard into Tikrit.|$|R
5|$|In mid-1943, Shoup was {{transferred}} to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on <b>Tarawa</b> Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience.|$|E
5|$|After refit {{work was}} {{completed}} on 31 March 1942, Colorado carried out extensive training maneuvers along the West Coast, {{before returning to}} Pearl Harbor to complete her final preparations for action. She operated {{in the vicinity of}} the Fiji Islands and New Hebrides from 8 November 1942 to 17 September 1943 to prevent any further Japanese expansion in the Pacific. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 21 October 1943 to provide pre-invasion shelling and fire support for the invasion of <b>Tarawa,</b> returning to port on 7 December 1943. After another overhaul on the West Coast, Colorado returned to Lahaina Roads, in the Hawaiian Islands, on 21 January 1944 and sortied the next day for the Marshall Islands. She provided the pre-invasion bombardment and fire support for the invasions of Kwajalein and Eniwetok until 23 February, when she headed for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for another overhaul.|$|E
5|$|On November 16, the Kiribati islands {{suffered}} the side-effects of Cyclone Tia, with several houses in <b>Tarawa</b> and seaweed farms damaged. Late on November 17, TCWC Nadi started to release special advisories for Vanautu {{after it had}} become clear that the systems south-southwest movement, would bring the cyclone sufficiently close to the Banks and Torres Islands to cause either gale or storm force winds. Over the next 24 hours, TCWC Nadi continued to issue these bulletins as the system moved southwards and brought gale force winds to Maewo, Pentecost and the Banks Islands before they issued the final advisory early on November 19. Tia {{was the first of}} six tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu during the 1991–92 South Pacific cyclone season, and caused minor damage that was mainly confined to houses, crops and fruit trees on the Banks and Torres Islands. Within the Banks Islands a church was flattened, several roads were blocked and a man was slightly injured by flying debris.|$|E
5|$|Returning from <b>Tarawa,</b> Radford was reassigned {{as chief}} of staff to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. He {{assisted}} in planning upcoming operations, including Operation Flintlock, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. He had hoped to return to combat duty {{at the end of this}} assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear and tear. After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.|$|E
5|$|She is {{most notable}} for her service in World War II. She was present on Battleship Row during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and was lightly damaged by Japanese bombs. Returning to duty in 1942, she saw {{service in the}} Pacific War, first {{supporting}} {{the rest of the}} fleet at the Battle of Midway, and then patrolling the Fiji Islands to guard against Japanese incursion. Next, she went on the offensive, commencing shore bombardments in the Battle of <b>Tarawa</b> and later in the Battle of Kwajalein. During the Battle of Saipan she took torpedo damage to her bow, necessitating repairs and refits. She then participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf where she was hit by a kamikaze. She took another kamikaze hit at the Battle of Okinawa, and was under repair at the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|That month, Nagato, Yamato, Fusō and {{the escort}} carrier , escorted by two heavy cruisers and five destroyers {{transferred}} to Truk in the Caroline Islands. In {{response to the}} carrier raid on <b>Tarawa</b> on 18 September, Nagato {{and much of the}} fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested an attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, Nagato and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok {{to be in a position}} to intercept any such attack. The fleet arrived on 19 October, departed four days later, and arrived back at Truk on 26 October. Hayakawa was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 November and he was relieved on 25 December by Captain Yuji Kobe.|$|E
5|$|In May, Shōkaku and Zuikaku were {{assigned}} to a mission to counterattack the American offensive in the Aleutian Islands, but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on Attu on 29 May 1943. The sister ships were transferred to Truk in July. In response to the carrier raid on <b>Tarawa</b> on 18 September, the carriers {{and much of the}} fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested another attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, Shōkaku and Zuikaku and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok {{to be in a position}} to intercept any such attack, but no attack occurred and the fleet returned to Truk. At the beginning of November, the bulk of their air groups were transferred to Rabaul to bolster the defenses there, just in time to help defend the port against the Allied attack a few days later. They accomplished little there, for the loss of over half their number, before returning to Truk on the 13th. The sisters returned to Japan in December.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 1943, Yamato was {{replaced}} by her sister ship Musashi as flagship of the Combined Fleet. The battleship spent only a single day away from Truk between her arrival in August 1942 and her departure on 8 May 1943. On that day, she set sail for Yokosuka and from there for Kure, arriving on 14 May. She spent nine days in dry dock for inspection and general repairs, and after sailing to Japan's western Inland Sea she was again dry-docked in late July for significant refitting and upgrades. On 16 August, Yamato began her return to Truk, where she joined a large task force formed in response to American raids on the <b>Tarawa</b> and Makin atolls. She sortied in late September with Nagato, three carriers, and smaller warships to intercept US Task Force 15, and again a month later with six battleships, three carriers, and eleven cruisers. Intelligence had reported that the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor was nearly empty of ships, which the Japanese interpreted to mean that an American naval force would strike at Wake Island. But there were no radar contacts for six days, and the fleet returned to Truk, arriving on 26 October.|$|E
5|$|The M3 saw {{action for}} the first time during the defense of the Philippines in December 1941. It {{went on to become a}} factor in the Guadalcanal Campaign, where it was {{successfully}} employed against both Japanese armor and infantry. Throughout the war it remained effective against Japanese vehicles, which were thinly armored and were rarely committed in large groups. The light weight of the gun made it easy to move through difficult terrain; for example, when attacked by Japanese tanks on Betio during the Battle of <b>Tarawa,</b> Marines were able to heave the M3 over the -high seawall. While high-explosive and canister ammunition proved useful in stopping Japanese infantry attacks, against enemy fortifications the M3 was only somewhat effective because of its small high-explosive projectile. Its overall effectiveness and ease of use meant the gun remained in service with the Marine Corps and with some army units in the Pacific until the end of the war. Unhappy with the unusually low shield of the M3, some Marine Corps units extended it to provide better protection. These extensions sometimes had a scalloped top edge, intended to improve camouflage. A standard kit was tested in 1945, but was never issued.|$|E
25|$|Each of the 21 {{inhabited}} islands has a {{local council}} that {{takes care of}} the daily affairs. <b>Tarawa</b> Atoll has three councils: Betio Town Council, Te Inainano Urban Council (for the rest of South <b>Tarawa)</b> and Eutan <b>Tarawa</b> Council (for North <b>Tarawa).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tarawa</b> was {{a kitten}} rescued from a pillbox during the Battle of <b>Tarawa</b> by the United States Coast Guard and named <b>Tarawa.</b> She was a mascot aboard an LST, {{but did not}} get along with the LST's other mascot, a dog named Kodiak, and jumped ship ashore.|$|E
25|$|Kiribati became {{independent}} from the United Kingdom in 1979. The capital and now most populated area, South <b>Tarawa,</b> {{consists of a}} number of islets, connected by a series of causeways. These comprise about half the area of <b>Tarawa</b> Atoll.|$|E
25|$|USS <b>Tarawa</b> (CV/CVA/CVS-40, AVT-12) {{was one of}} 24 s built {{during and}} shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the first US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the bloody 1943 Battle of <b>Tarawa.</b> <b>Tarawa</b> was {{commissioned}} in December 1945, too late to serve in World War II. After serving a short time in the Far East, she was decommissioned in 1949. She was soon recommissioned after the Korean War began, serving in the Atlantic {{as a replacement for}} carriers sent to Korea. In the early 1950s, she was redesignated an attack carrier (CVA) and then an antisubmarine warfare carrier (CVS). Except for one tour in the Far East, she spent her entire second career operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Consequently, <b>Tarawa</b> was the only ship of her class to never see combat action.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tarawa</b> Atoll {{and others}} of the Gilbert group were {{occupied}} by Japan from 1941 to 1943 during World War II. Betio became an airfield and supply base. The expulsion of the Japanese military in late 1943 involved one of the bloodiest battles in US Marine Corps history. Marines landed in November 1943 and the Battle of <b>Tarawa</b> ensued.|$|E
