5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley was <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF {{wanted to}} settle the valley in order to {{establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of Jewish settlements in the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E
5|$|With {{a budget}} of $2 million and 350,000 lines of C++ and UnrealScript, Unreal Tournament took almost {{a year and a}} half to develop. When Unreal (the first {{installment}} of the Unreal series) was released in May 1998, it was well received by the press. However, it soon became apparent that the quality of the network code used for multiplayer matches was hampering the game's further success. In the months following Unreals release, improving the game's multiplayer part became <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> of the development team. Epic Games started considering an official expansion pack intended to improve the network code while also featuring new maps and other gameplay elements.|$|E

5|$|Earlier historians, {{including}} Beale, {{believed that}} money drove events, {{and had seen}} Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians {{began to focus on}} the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing Civil Rights Movement as a second Reconstruction; some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{huge number}} of Rome's finest troops, {{including}} most of the Gaul comitatus and perhaps half the combined Eastern/Illyricum force, were wiped out in the civil war. At the Battle of Mursa in Pannonia (351), one of the bloodiest in Roman history, Magnentius lost an estimated 24,000 men (perhaps two-thirds of his army). Constantius' army, although victorious, suffered even greater casualties (about 30,000). A final encounter at the Battle of Mons Seleucus in the Alps saw further heavy casualties. Such massive losses of first-grade troops could not quickly or easily be replaced. Constantius, now based in Milan, was left with an escort army of about 30,000, but Illyricum and the East had been stripped of their comitatus. With renewed Persian attacks, the East was <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> for reinforcement and Illyricum second. In the circumstances, Constantius could only spare in the region of 13,000 men for the Gaul comitatus, about half its previous strength. The Frankish-born general Silvanus was appointed its commander (magister equitum).|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the NPL decided that, of all the work being {{carried out by the}} TRE on its behalf, ACE was to be given <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority.</b> NPL's decision led to a visit by the superintendent of the TRE's Physics Division on 22 November 1946, accompanied by Frederic C. Williams and A. M. Uttley, also from the TRE. Williams led a TRE development group working on CRT stores for radar applications, as an alternative to delay lines. He had already accepted a professorship at the University of Manchester, and most of his circuit technicians {{were in the process of}} being transferred to the Department of Atomic Energy. The TRE agreed to second a small number of technicians to work under Williams' direction at the university, and to support another small group working with Uttley at the TRE.|$|E

5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E
25|$|AWPD-42 {{called for}} 177 targets to be hit, {{covering}} seven strategic areas, {{with the highest}} priority being enemy aircraft production. Other priorities were submarine pens and building yards, transportation systems, electric power generation and distribution, the petroleum industry, aluminum refining and manufacture, and the synthetic rubber industry. Hansell considered it a mistake to remove electricity from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority,</b> and worse still to place submarine pens there. Political expediency dictated the shift in target priorities, not pure strategic considerations.|$|E

On the night of October 19–20, the Israelis sent much of the 8th Brigade and Negev's 7th Battalion to the enclave, as well as Negev Brigade infantry forces (from the 9th Battalion) engaged in raids in the Gaza–Rafah corridor (today the Gaza Strip). On October 20, the commanders of the respective forces met in the Negev Brigade headquarters in Shoval for a final briefing.|$|E
25|$|The Public Buildings Commission also {{announced}} it would build an 1,800-car parking lot next to the Department of Commerce building, and would proceed with construction of the Commerce and Archives first (as they were <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority).</b> Three months later, the estimates for construction of the Commerce building was increased to $16 million from $10 million and for the Internal Revenue building to $10.5 million from $2.5 million. Work on the Commerce building site was expected to begin by March 31, 1927. Government officials, other experts, and the press believed that the demolition of the District Building and Old Post Office Pavilion and the closure of many streets in the area would occur.|$|E

Whitehurst proposed spending $650,000 in fiscal 1939 to survey and design the structure and begin its construction. Whitehurst's proposal received the immediate support of the Hillcrest Citizens Association, which began lobbying the District Commissioners to seek the appropriation yet again.|$|E
25|$|On 26 April, General Phoumi Nosavan of the Royal Lao Army {{urgently}} requested {{air strikes}} {{to ward off}} threatened communist assaults on Luang Prabang, Pakxan, Vientiane, and Savannakhet. Ambassador Brown {{did not want to}} scuttle an upcoming 12 May ceasefire, but felt he would order Millpond bombings if provoked by communist attacks. With this decision, he eliminated <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> Millpond objective and took up the secondary one of supporting troops in contact. Meanwhile, the pilots were confined to the air base except for occasional photo reconnaissance by a camera-equipped RB-26. On the second of these, on 1 May, the Millpond RB-26 was damaged by 37mm antiaircraft fire over Napé on the Lao-Vietnamese border. The B-26s were then grounded. However, the Invaders never did fly a bombing sortie.|$|E

25|$|Johnson, {{whose own}} ticket {{out of poverty}} was a public {{education}} in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty, and was {{an essential component of}} the American dream, especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted budgets from local taxes. He made education <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, LBJ launched a legislative effort which took the name of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. The bill sought to double federal spending on education from $4 billion to $8 billion.; with considerable facilitating by the White House, it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26 and then it remarkably passed without change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. This was an historic accomplishment by the president, with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before.|$|E
25|$|Finland {{began to}} {{actively}} seek {{a way out}} of the war after the disastrous German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad in February 1943. Edwin Linkomies formed a new cabinet with peace as <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>priority.</b> Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943–44 between Finland and its representative, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, on one side, and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached. Stalin decided to force Finland to surrender; a bombing campaign on Helsinki followed. The air campaign in February 1944 included three major air attacks involving a total of over 6,000 sorties. Finnish anti-aircraft defences managed to repel the raids as only five percent of the dropped bombs hit their planned targets. Helsinki's air defense included the strategic placing of searchlights and fires as decoys outside the city to lure the Soviet bombers to drop their payloads in what were actually unpopulated areas. Major air attacks also hit Oulu and Kotka, but because of radio intelligence and effective anti-aircraft defences, the number of casualties was small.|$|E
