Orthodoxy does not permit women <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> minyan (prayer <b>quorum)</b> and while the women have not considered themselves as doing so, this has not calmed ultra-Orthodox sensibilities. [...] Initially, the group did not receive support from Israel's primarily Orthodox religious authorities. Supporters highlighted {{the fact that only}} in Israel are Jewish women prohibited from praying according to their custom in a public location and a 2003 High Court ruling which prevented them from conducting prayer services at the wall was overturned in 2013.|$|R

5000|$|Legal academic, Pierre de Vos, {{writes that}} Hlophe intends {{to appeal the}} SCA judgements in the Constitutional Court, adding that this would create [...] "a {{fascinating}} constitutional problem which us lawyers will discuss for years to come", since only four of the currently sitting justices of the Constitutional Court were not complainants in the original case, and at least eight of the full eleven Constitutional Court justices are required <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> <b>quorum.</b>|$|E

Wu convinced Chen Jiongming to oust Sun from Guangzhou in return for recognition of his control over Guangdong. Enough members of the old parliament moved to Beijing <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> <b>quorum</b> which superficially gave the government an appearance that it operated as it did before the Manchu Restoration in 1917.Li's new administration was more powerless than his first. His cabinet appointments had to be approved by Wu Peifu. Wu's growing power and prestige outshone his mentor and superior officer, Cao Kun, which strained relations between the two. Cao wanted to become president himself but Wu tried to restrain his ambitions. President Li tried to create an [...] "Able Men Cabinet" [...] consisting of experts but he ruined it by arresting Finance Minister Luo Wengan on spurious rumours supplied by the speakers of parliament. The cabinet resigned en-masse and Wu was no longer able to shield Li. Cao Kun's followers controlled the new cabinet and bribed parliament to impeach Li. Next, Cao orchestrated strikes by unpaid police and had the utilities for the presidential manor cut. Li tried to take the presidential seal with him but was intercepted.|$|E
