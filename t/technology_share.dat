[...] Charley Walters of Rolling Stone found it a [...] "major triumph" [...] that Eno's creative risks [...] "so consistently pan out", and said that it is [...] "indeed an important record—and also a brilliant one". Negative reviews of the album focused on the lack of the rock songs from Eno's previous albums.

40|$|Abstract – The aim of {{this short}} paper is to sketch an {{analytic}} approach to innovation {{from the perspective of}} philosophy of technology. Until now, philosophers have been reluctant to address issues of innovation—even though both innovation research and philosophy of <b>technology</b> <b>share</b> the same object of study: the intersection of science, technology, and society. In this paper I will reveal normative assumptions in innovation research. I identify normativity in four areas: (1) theory of society and innovation, (2) objects of innovation (artifacts, processes, knowledge, problems), (3) process of innovation, and (4) ethics and innovation. This paper presents an outline for a research program and a catalog of questions—and not a net argumentation or final answers. The aim is to attract philosophical interest and to stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration between social scientists and philosophers...|$|E

Fourteen common strategic partnering incentives are concluded from the construction companies' perspective and extended to 20 items in questionnaire for data collection and analysis.

To compare the views from strategic partnering participants in the construction industry, data was collected from two groups of respondents: 80 contractors and 36 consultants. The analysis results reveal that both contractors and consultants consider "competitive position enhancement" and "new market entry" as the most significant incentives for strategic partnering. Conversely, the factors listed under "increased cultural responsiveness" and "project-based" are ranked low. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E
40|$|Technical domains are {{affected}} by continuous change {{as a reflection of}} technological progress. Correspondingly, concept descriptions of terminological knowledge bases for such domains must be adjusted to these dynamics. In this paper we propose a concept versioning methodology which accounts for the evolutionary adaptation of already established concepts according to the gradual shaping of new standards. The approach is based on the provision of qualitative progress models for the given domain, measures for the prediction and evaluation of the significance of progress, and a representation and update scheme for concept version management. 1 INTRODUCTION Technical domains, such as information, hi-fi, or automobile <b>technology,</b> <b>share</b> a common feature, namely that their underlying concept systems undergo continuous change.

The three themes of the program all call for an integration of textile and computational materials, but from different perspectives. They aim at deepening our understanding of i) computational technology as design material, ii) textile as design material and of iii) the more general question of the interplay between spatial and temporal form elements in design...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{patterns}} of technological specialisation of advanced countries change {{over a period}} of time in which globalisation in technology occurs. The theoretical analysis of this question is based on models of new growth and trade theory - especially a model by Grossman/Helpman (1991) - as well as on evolutionary economics. The empirical analysis, based on the patent applications in 42 R&D-intensive product groups of the ten strongest patent producing countries, is divided into two parts. First, structural decomposition analysis is used to investigate the effects that determine changes of technological specialisation. Secondly, the concepts of beta and omicron - despecilisation (or -specialisation), which are very similar to the concepts of beta- and omicron-convergence (or divergence), are operationalised and applied to investigate whether countries are moving towards an average specialisation and whether dispersions of relative patent shares of the firms in the individual countries have been reduced during the time. Taking all results together, evidence points to rather stable dispersions of technological specialisations. However, results indicating beta- despecilisation also show that the majority of national innovation systems are now moving towards an average technological specialisation. This is quite in accord with the results of the structural decomposition analysis where the <b>technology</b> <b>share</b> effects and not the structural effects are predominant...|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} in patent {{data can be}} used for strategic planning purposes. A conceptual framework is developed showing the use of patent {{information in}} core areas of technology management. This paper addresses how patent information {{can be used for}} competitor monitoring, technology assessment, R&D portfolio management, the identification and assessment of potential sources for the external generation of technological knowledge, especially by means of mergers and acquisitions, and human resource management. Indicators of patenting strategies and various portfolio concepts which can be used for these purposes are described. Because of its strategic value, it is argued that the retrieval and evaluation of patent data should be institutionalized within the organization in order to ensure the continuous and systematic use of patent information in a company's decision-making processes. How patent information becomes a core element of a firm's knowledge management system is outlined. This type of strategic patent information is geared toward two important recipients: (1) senior management who uses this information for decision-making purposes in important areas of technology management and (2) external stakeholders of the firm, such as shareholders and analysts, who have an increasing interest in assessing a firm's technological competence because of its strong impact on the firm's future competitiveness.

40|$|At Halloween {{the veil}} between worlds becomes thin, hauntings are played out, level {{violations}} occur and objects are beached. Metalepsis is a bleeding of {{the boundaries between}} narrative levels or logically distinct worlds. My project works through archaeology and gaming: prehistoric materialities and ‘post-historic’ informatic cultures and spaces of encounter. To perceive an artifact in substitutional terms is to understand it as belonging {{to more than one}} historical moment simultaneously. A skeuomorph, etymologically a container-form, is a figure of anachronism: a temporal or material inconsistency of method and material. Skeuomorphs are familiar in digital interfaces. They disguise the monstrosity of transition between the digital and the analogue worlds. As an archaeological term skeuomorph denotes artefacts made from one material to imitate a form usually made from another. For instance, an axe-head fabricated from chalk - a violent object safely displaced into the symbolic. Material transpositions may shift symbolic registers and produce temporal slippages, proleptic encounters. Data objects produced by 3 D imaging <b>technology</b> <b>share</b> some characteristics with prehistoric ones, being mobile, portable, depositable and subject to assemblage. If prehistory is understood through materialities and process, the embedding of living and dying into a stratified landscape; post-historic informatic cultures produce othered materialities, constructions of self, weaponised images, hauntings and forms of grief-play.

However, computers have not only become smaller, faster and less expensive – this technology is also used to realise a plethora of new kinds of devices such as digital cameras, mobile phones, musical instruments and video games...|$|E

They were greeted on arrival by Senior vice president Academic Development Professor Datuk Parid Wardi, vice-president Corporate Relations and Integration Fajura Juffa and vice president Network Development and Student Services Department Nazaruddin Abdul Jalil. The University Malaysia Kelantan spent almost four hours visiting the campus where they visited the Presidential library, the Malaysia Branding and Packaging Design Centre and had a briefing at the President’s board room. Professor Ir Dr Zainai Mohamed also made a 30 minutes courtesy call to president and founder Professor Emeritus Tan Sri Dr Lim Kok Wing at his office.
