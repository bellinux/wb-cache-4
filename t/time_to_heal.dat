5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>heal,</b> the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald {{managed to escape}} {{with the aid of}} Rögnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed there for some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>heal</b> his wounds, and {{thereafter}} (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus' (referred to in the sagas as Garðaríki or Svíþjóð hin mikla). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg), arriving there {{in the first half of}} 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and Morkinskinna says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} pedal arch quality on the amputation-free survival and patency rates of distal bypass grafts and its direct impact on the rate of <b>healing</b> and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> of tissue loss after direct angiosome revascularization in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). MethodsBetween 2004 and 2011, patients undergoing distal bypass for CLI (Rutherford 4 - 6) were divided in groups taking into consideration {{the state of the}} pedal arch and direct angiosome revascularization (DAR) and non-DAR. Angiography was used to divide the pedal arch into three groups: complete pedal arch (CPA), incomplete pedal arch (IPA), and no pedal arch (NPA). The primary end points were patency rates at 12 months, amputation-free survival at 48  months, and the rate of <b>healing</b> and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> of foot tissue loss. ResultsA total of 154 patients (75 % men) with CLI underwent 167 infrapopliteal bypasses. Patients were a median age of 75 years (range, 46 - 96 years). Diabetic mellitus was present in 76 %, chronic renal failure in 28 %, and ischemic heart disease in 44 %. The primary patency rates at 1 year in the CPA, IPA, and NPA groups were 58. 4 %, 54. 6 %, and 63. 8 %, respectively (P =. 5168), the secondary patency rates were 86. 0 %, 84. 7 %, and 88. 8 %, respectively (P =. 8940), and the amputation-free survival at 48 months was 67. 2 %, 69. 7 %, and 45. 9 %, respectively (P =. 3883). Tissue loss was present in 141 of the 167 bypasses. In the CPA group, 83 % of tissue loss with DAR healed compared with 92 % in the non-DAR (median <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing,</b> 66  vs 74 days). Similarly in the IPA group, 90 % with DAR healed compared with 81 % in the non-DAR (median <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing,</b> 96 vs 86 days). In the NPA group, only 75 % with DAR healed compared with 73 % in the non-DAR (median <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing,</b> 90 vs 135 days). There was a significant difference in <b>healing</b> and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> between the CPA/IPA and NPA groups (P =. 0264). ConclusionsThe quality of the pedal arch did not influence the patency or the amputation-free survival rates.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: A nurse-managed/physician-supervised {{treatment}} program for venous ulceration was evaluated {{to determine the}} influence of venous hemodynamics, comorbidities, patient behavior, and ulcer characteristics on <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recurrence. Methods: The clinical course and long-term follow-up of 71 patients with 99 venous ulcers diagnosed between November 1981 and August 1994 were analyzed by a retrospective review of clinic records. Demographic data, severity of venous insufficiency, ulcer characteristics, and patient compliance were studied. Outcome variables were <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete ulcer <b>healing</b> and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> first recurrence. Results: Ninety-one percent of the ulcers healed completely at a median 3. 4 months. There were 52 (57 %) recurrences at a median 10. 4 months. Ulcers on limbs with a venous refill time of 10 seconds or less demonstrated a significantly longer <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete <b>healing</b> (p ≤ 0. 03); however, no effect on <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recurrence was observed. Patients who were in strict compliance with the treatment regimen (n = 32) had significantly faster healing (p ≤ 0. 02) and fewer recurrences (p ≤ 0. 004) compared with patients who were less compliant (n = 67). Conclusions: Most venous ulcers can be expected <b>to</b> <b>heal</b> when patients are enrolled in a nurse-managed/physician-supervised ambulatory ulcer clinic. Photoplethysmography-derived venous refill time of 10 seconds or less predicted delayed healing.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} effectiveness of weekly delivery of low dose, high frequency therapeutic ultrasound {{in conjunction with}} standard care for hard <b>to</b> <b>heal</b> venous leg ulcers. Design: Multicentre, pragmatic, two arm randomised controlled trial. Setting: Community and district nurse led services, community leg ulcer clinics, and hospital outpatient leg ulcer clinics in 12 urban and rural settings (11 in the United Kingdom {{and one in the}} Republic of Ireland). Participants: 337 patients with at least one venous leg ulcer of > 6 months' duration or > 5 cm 2 area and an ankle brachial pressure index of ≥ 0. 8. Interventions: Weekly administration of low dose, high frequency ultrasound therapy (0. 5 W/cm 2, 1 MHz, pulsed pattern of 1 : 4) for up to 12 weeks plus standard care compared with standard care alone. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> of the largest eligible leg ulcer. Secondary outcomes were proportion of patients healed by 12 months, percentage and absolute change in ulcer size, proportion of time participants were ulcer-free, health related quality of life, and adverse events. Results: The two groups showed {{no significant difference in the}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> of the reference leg ulcer (log rank test, P= 0. 61). After adjustment for baseline ulcer area, baseline ulcer duration, use of compression bandaging, and study centre, there was still no evidence of a difference in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> (hazard ratio 0. 99 (95 % confidence interval 0. 70 to 1. 40), P= 0. 97). The median <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> of the reference leg ulcer was inestimable. There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of participants with all ulcers healed by 12 months (72 / 168 in ultrasound group v 78 / 169 in standard care group, P= 0. 39 for Fisher's exact test) nor in the change in ulcer size at four weeks by treatment group (model estimate 0. 05 (95 % CI - 0. 09 to 0. 19)). There was no difference in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete <b>healing</b> of all ulcers (log rank test, P= 0. 61), with median <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> of 328 days (95 % CI 235 to inestimable) with standard care and 365 days (224 days to inestimable) with ultrasound. There was no evidence of a difference in rates of recurrence of healed ulcers (17 / 31 with ultrasound v 14 / 31 with standard care, P= 0. 68 for Fisher's exact test). There was no difference between the two groups in health related quality of life, both for the physical component score (model estimate 0. 69 (- 1. 79 to 3. 08)) and the mental component score (model estimate - 0. 93 (- 3. 30 to 1. 44)), but there were significantly more adverse events in the ultrasound group (model estimate 0. 30 (0. 01 to 0. 60)). There was a significant relation between <b>time</b> <b>to</b> ulcer <b>healing</b> and baseline ulcer area (hazard ratio 0. 64 (0. 55 to 0. 75)) and baseline ulcer duration (hazard ratio 0. 59 (0. 50 to 0. 71)), with larger and older ulcers taking longer <b>to</b> <b>heal.</b> In addition, those centres with high recruitment rates had the highest healing rates.

40|$|Abstract Background Radiographic {{healing is}} a common outcome measure in {{orthopedic}} trials and adjudication by outcome assessors is often conducted {{on the basis of}} plain films alone. The degree to which this process reflects clinical practice, in which both plain films and clinical notes are available, is uncertain. We explored the effect of adding clinical notes to radiographs in the adjudication process of a feasibility trial of tibial shaft fractures. Methods Radiographic and clinical data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial of 51 patients with operatively treated tibial fractures formed the basis of the study data. At the completion of the trial, serial radiographs (anteroposterior and lateral) were independently evaluated for progression of fracture healing, defined as bridging of at least 3 of 4 cortices, by an adjudication committee comprised of 3 blinded orthopaedic trauma surgeons. Immediately after determination of radiographic <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing,</b> each surgeon was provided with clinical notes associated with each radiographic follow up visit and asked to re-visit their initial impression. Consensus was achieved for both adjudications. We calculated the percentage of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> consensus decisions that changed after evaluation of clinical notes. We further examined the contents of clinical notes and their relative influence on the committee's decisions. Results 47 of 51 patients were determined <b>to</b> have <b>healed</b> radiographically during the trial follow-up period, and consideration of clinical notes resulted in a change of 40 % (19 of 47) of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> consensus decisions; however, revised decisions were equally likely to support an earlier or a later <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing.</b> Clinical notes that resulted in a change to either a 'healed' or a 'not healed' decision contained significantly more comments of either pain resolution or deterioration, respectively, resumption of or failure to resume weightbearing, or either return or no return to work/pre-injury activities (p Conclusions The addition of clinical notes to the adjudication of radiographic fracture healing changed the outcome decision in a substantial number of cases.

25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>heal,</b> {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is {{in order to allow}} production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications {{have been shown to be}} useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tibial stress {{fractures}} increasingly affect {{athletes and}} military recruits, with few known effective management options. Electrical stimulation enhances regular fracture healing {{but the effect}} on stress fractures has not been definitively tested. Hypothesis: Capacitively coupled electric field stimulation (CCEFS) will accelerate tibial stress fracture healing. Study design: Double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Methods: 20 men and 24 women with acute posteromedial tibial stress fracture were referred from local clinicians. Subjects were randomly assigned active or placebo CCEFS to be applied for 15 hours per day until healed, given supplemental calcium and instructed to rest from provocative training. Healing was confirmed when hopping to 10 cm for 30 seconds could be achieved without pain. Results: No difference in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> was detected between treatment and placebo groups. Females in the treatment group healed more slowly than males (p = 0. 05). Superior treatment compliance was associated with reduced <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> (p = 0. 003).

Conclusions: Whole group analysis did not detect an effect of CCEFS on tibial stress fracture healing, however, greater device use and less weight bearing loading enhanced {{the effectiveness of the}} active device. More severe stress fractures healed more quickly with CCEFS. Clinical relevance: While the use of CCEFS for tibial stress fracture healing may not be efficacious for all, it may be indicated for the more severely injured or elite athlete/recruit whose incentive to return to activity may motivate superior compliance.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between severity grade for radiography, triple-phase technetium 99 m nuclear medicine bone scanning, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and computed tomography (CT); clinical severity; and recovery time from a tibial stress injury (TSI), as well as to evaluate interassessor grading reliability. Materials and Methods: This protocol was approved by the Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee, the Stanford University Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research, the U. S. Army Human Subjects Research Review Board, and the Australian Defense Human Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Forty subjects (17 men, 23 women; mean age, 26. 2 years 6 6. 9 [standard deviation]) with TSI were enrolled. Subjects were examined acutely with standard anteroposterior and lateral radiography, nuclear medicine scanning, MR imaging, and CT. Each modality was graded by four blinded clinicians. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between image severity, clinical severity, and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing,</b> with adjustments for image modality and assessor. Grading reliability was evaluated with the Cronbach a coefficient. Results: Image assessment reliability was high for all grading systems except radiography, which was moderate (a = 0. 565 - 0. 895). Clinical severity was negatively associated with MR imaging severity (P ?. 001). There was no significant relationship between <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> and severity score for any imaging modality, although a positive trend existed for MR imaging (P =. 07). Conclusion: TSI clinical severity was negatively related to MR imaging severity. Radiographic, bone scan, and CT severity were not related <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing,</b> but there was a positive trend for MR imaging. No Full Tex...|$|R

(2001) {{determined}} that TCC had a healing rate of 88.9%, compared to 65% for a removable cast walker and 58.3% for a half-shoe, and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> was least for TCC at 4.8 weeks, compared to 7.2 weeks for the removable cast walker and 8.7 weeks for the half-shoe.

500|$|Ford {{remained}} relatively {{active in the}} years after his presidency. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> <b>Heal</b> (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, [...] "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|Near {{the end of}} March 2012, Reimer was {{starting}} to play to an acceptable standard again, but an upper-body injury (later revealed to be a neck injury) sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season from March 29. On April 9, he told the media that he would be available by training camp in September 2012. Due to the NHL lockout, Reimer was afforded more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>heal</b> and attended training camp in January 2013. Reimer held off an early challenge from rookie backup Ben Scrivens to remain Toronto's starting goaltender. On February 11, Reimer suffered a MCL strain, which kept him out of action for a little over two weeks, he won all three of his next starts after returning. Upon returning Reimer backstopped the Maple Leafs to their first playoff berth since 2004 and finishing the regular season with a career best 2.46 GAA and [...]924 SV% in 34 games.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of two types of compression treatment (four layer bandage and short stretch bandage) in people with venous leg ulceration. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of patient level data. Data: sources Electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and National Research Register) and reference lists of retrieved articles searched to identify relevant trials and primary investigators. Primary investigators of eligible trials were invited to contribute raw data for re-analysis. Review: methods Randomised controlled trials of four layer bandage compared with short stretch bandage in people with venous leg ulceration were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome for the meta-analysis was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing.</b> Cox proportional hazards models were run to compare the methods in terms of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>healing</b> with adjustment for independent predictors of healing. Secondary outcomes included incidence and number of adverse events per patient.
