5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> known pharmacological activity of these substances in {{medicinal plants}} is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where medicinal plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them.|$|E

5|$|After {{making their}} debut with Shavukar (1950), B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios signed Kadiri Venkata Reddy {{later in the}} year to make a {{folklore}} film. The film was based on a story from Kasi Majilee Kathalu, written by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu. Pingali Nagendrarao adapted <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> wrote the film's story. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao and Venkata Reddy worked on the film's screenplay. Nagendrarao was also inspired from the story of Aladdin. Vijaya Vauhini Studios team worked for three to four months on the film's script and Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh was chosen as the story's backdrop. Pathala Bhairavi was made as a bilingual film, shot in Telugu and Tamil simultaneously with both the versions having the same title. The Tamil version's dialogues were written by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1975, EMI/Capitol {{had issued}} greatest-hits {{collections}} on the Apple Records imprint for Lennon and Starr – Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past, respectively. Since Lennon and Starr were still nominally Apple artists, they each had input into <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> packaging of their solo compilation, and Lennon, in particular, {{was active in}} promoting his album. Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past sold reasonably well, in America, but their sales failed to match record-company expectations. For Harrison, there had been long delays between releases following the international success of his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970–71, due first to {{his commitment to the}} Bangladesh humanitarian aid project and later to his production work for Dark Horse Records acts Splinter and Ravi Shankar. Harrison issued his final studio album for Apple in the autumn of 1975, Extra Texture (Read All About It). As a result, by the time that Capitol came to prepare a compilation of his solo work the following year, he had effectively surrendered all artistic control over its content.|$|E

5|$|Mad Maxs quest design also {{received}} mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> activities {{scattered across the}} world, calling the activities engaging for most players. However, he disliked the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the objectives are unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought nothing new to the genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.|$|E
5|$|Revelations {{emphasizes}} survival, evasion, {{and exploration}} over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. It was designed to bring back <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> horror of the series' roots, {{while at the same}} time trying to modernize the gameplay. Revelations was also the first game to support the Nintendo 3DS Circle Pad Pro outside Japan. The game was a moderate commercial success and received generally positive reviews from video game publications. Several critics praised its graphics, sound effects, and horror setting, but some criticized its inconsistent gameplay between scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>and</b> graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. Mystery of the Emblem was initially only going to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light for those who had not played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem. Due to space limitations, some characters featured in the original version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, Mystery of the Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E
