5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> barnacles.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, {{the common}} {{starling}} {{was introduced in}} 1897 by Cecil Rhodes. It spread slowly and by 1954 had reached Clanwilliam and Port Elizabeth. It is now common in the southern Cape region, thinning out northwards to the Johannesburg area. It {{is present in the}} Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Free State provinces of South Africa and lowland Lesotho, with occasional sightings in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and around the town of Oranjemund in Namibia. In Southern Africa populations appear to be resident and the bird is very much associated with man, his habitations and pastures. It favours irrigated land and is absent from regions where the ground is baked so dry that it cannot probe for insects. It may compete with native birds for crevice nesting sites but the indigenous species are probably more disadvantaged by destruction of their natural habitat than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> inter-specific competition. It breeds from September to December and outside the breeding season may congregate in large flocks, often roosting in reedbeds. It is the most common bird species in urban and agricultural areas.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. Anthropologists have considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended {{over a period of time}} to assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> no means mutually exclusive.|$|E

25|$|Individual laments {{lamenting the}} fate of the {{particular}} individual who utters them. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> far {{the most common type of}} psalm.

25|$|Isolated limb {{perfusion}} (often used in melanoma), or isolated {{infusion of}} chemotherapy into the liver or the lung {{have been used}} to treat some tumors. The main purpose of these approaches is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy to tumor sites without causing overwhelming systemic damage. These approaches can help control solitary or limited metastases, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> definition not systemic, and, therefore, do not treat distributed metastases or micrometastases.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion is {{the state}} of {{primarily}} obtaining gratification from outside oneself. Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> themselves.|$|E
25|$|Urban ecosystems, {{influenced}} as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> {{the density}} of human buildings and activities differ considerably from those of their rural surroundings. Anthropogenic buildings and waste, as well as cultivation in gardens, create physical and chemical environments which have no equivalents in wilderness, in some cases enabling exceptional biodiversity. They provide homes not only for immigrant humans but also for immigrant plants, bringing about interactions between species which never previously encountered each other. They introduce frequent disturbances (construction, walking) to plant and animal habitats, creating opportunities for recolonization and thus favoring young ecosystems with r-selected species dominant. On the whole, urban ecosystems are less complex and productive than others, due to the diminished absolute amount of biological interactions.|$|E

25|$|Bantus {{arrived in}} the Congo in several waves from 2000 BC to 500 AD, mainly from the area {{in what is now}} {{southern}} Nigeria. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>by</b> far the largest group, and the majority live as subsistence-farmers. They are present in almost every part of the country, and their languages make up three of the DRC's five officially-recognized languages. Among these are Kikongo, Lingala and Tshiluba. Kikongo is spoken by the Kongo people in the far west of the country, both on the coast and inland, and was promoted by the Belgian colonial administration. Elements of Kikongo have survived amongst the descendants of slaves in the Americas—for instance, the language of the Gullah people of South Carolina contains elements of Kikongo. Lingala, spoken in the capital Kinshasa, is increasingly understood throughout the country, as the lingua franca of trade, spoken along the vast Congo river and its many tributaries. Lingala's status as the language of the national army, as well its use in the lyrics of popular Congolese music, has encouraged its adoption, and it is now the most prominent language in the country. Tshiluba (also known as Chiluba and Luba-Kasai) is spoken in the southeastern Kasai regions.|$|E
500|$|<b>They</b> <b>are,</b> <b>by</b> definition, number fields (finite {{extensions}} of [...] ) or function fields over [...] (finite {{extensions of}} [...] ). As for local fields, {{these two types}} of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This function field analogy can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the Riemann hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the Weil conjectures (proven in 1974 by Deligne).|$|E
