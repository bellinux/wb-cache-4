5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies show that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} experiment, {{researchers}} asked subjects to make either origami frogs or cranes. They then asked the subjects how much <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> {{pay for their}} own work. Following this, researchers gathered another group of subjects who had not taken part in the origami creation. The new subjects were asked how much <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an origami built by the participants.|$|R

60|$|The {{woman who}} was their {{interpreter}} was bid, in the next place, to ask them if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> servants, and {{to work for the}} men who had brought them away to save their lives? At which they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, <b>to</b> intimate that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|R
25|$|The Inquiry {{believes}} that ultimately the KC can win back trust {{by showing that}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take responsibility for dogs registered with them and that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> lose members who do not meet high standards.|$|E
25|$|When {{a company}} {{establishes}} an ADR program, it must decide what exactly it wants {{out of the}} program, and how much time, effort, and other resources <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> commit. For this reason, there are different types of programs, or facilities, that a company can choose.|$|E
25|$|Buying {{and selling}} flexibility: ETFs {{can be bought}} and sold at current market prices {{at any time during}} the trading day, unlike mutual funds and unit {{investment}} trusts, which can only be traded at the end of the trading day. As publicly traded securities, their shares can be purchased on margin and sold short, enabling the use of hedging strategies, and traded using stop orders and limit orders, which allow investors to specify the price points at which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> trade.|$|E
50|$|Both {{companies}} said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> extend the current agreement but neither side could even agree on terms for that.|$|R
50|$|In one study, {{respondents}} were asked how much <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay to prevent migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds by covering the oil ponds with protective nets. Subjects were told that either 2,000, or 20,000, or 200,000 migrating birds were affected annually, for which subjects reported <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay $80, $78 and $88 respectively. Other studies of willingness-to-pay to prevent harm have found a logarithmic relationship or no relationship to scope size.|$|R

25|$|ARMs {{generally}} permit borrowers {{to lower}} their initial payments if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> assume the risk of interest rate changes. There is evidence that consumers tend to prefer contracts with the lowest initial rates, {{such as in the}} UK where consumers tend to focus on immediate monthly mortgage costs. Decisions of consumers may also be affected by the advice they get, and much of the advice is provided by lenders who may prefer ARMs because of financial market structures.|$|E
25|$|Baley has a {{flash of}} {{inspiration}} when he connects Enderby's emotional highs and lows to how close or far away Baley was to solving the murder, and obtaining a recording of the crime scene, manages to demonstrate that fragments of Enderby's glasses remain in situ. Given that the Spacers have already accepted that Sarton's death is unsolved, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> not prosecute Enderby for the accident if he agrees {{to work with them}} to promote colonization of other worlds amongst the Medievalists.|$|E
25|$|The G20's {{transparency}} and accountability have been questioned by critics, who {{call attention to the}} absence of a formal charter {{and the fact that the}} most important G20 meetings are closed-door. In 2001, the economist Frances Stewart proposed an Economic Security Council within the United Nations as an alternative to the G20. In such a council, members would be elected by the General Assembly based on their importance to the world economy, and the contribution <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> provide to world economic development.|$|E

25|$|Grit {{affects the}} effort a person {{contributes}} by {{acting on the}} importance pathway. When people value a goal as more valuable, meaningful, or relevant to their self-concept <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> expend more effort on it when necessary. The influence of individual differences in grit results in different levels of effort-related cardiac activity when gritty and less gritty individuals performed the same task. Grit is associated with differences in potential motivation, one pathway in motivational intensity theory. Grit may also influence an individual’s perception of task difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Though {{many of the}} {{previously}} proposed models were both costly and uncoordinated, a 2010 model by Boyd, Gintis and Bowles presents a mechanism for coordinated costly punishment. In this quorum-sensing model, each agent chooses whether or not <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> engage in punishment. If {{a sufficient number of}} agents are willing to engage in punishment, then the group acts collectively to administer it. An important aspect of this model is that strong reciprocity is self-regarding when rare in the population, but may be altruistic when common within a group.|$|E
25|$|Others contest these conclusions, {{stating that}} family courts are biased {{in favor of}} fathers and that the lower {{percentage}} of separated fathers as custodial parents {{is a result of}} choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts. According to sociologist Michael Flood, father's rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between mothers and fathers, and ignored {{the fact that in the}} vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.|$|E

30|$|When {{patients}} <b>were</b> {{asked if}} <b>they</b> would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay out-of-pocket {{to have an}} ACLR, 87 (34.8 %) said yes, 107 (42.8 %) said no, and 56 (22.4 %) said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unsure (Table  2). Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when patients <b>were</b> asked if <b>they</b> would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada and pay out-of-pocket to have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unsure. If patients stated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay to travel outside of Canada to have the procedure performed, the median (IQR) amount <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for this option was $ 2500.00 (3750.00). Further, patients who <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada for an expedited ACLR <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay a median (IQR) amount of $ 2000.00 (2000.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, whereas patients who were unwilling to travel outside of Canada <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay $ 600.00 (625.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, and this difference was statistically significant (p[*]<[*] 0.000). A multinomial logistic regression did not demonstrate any significant correlations between patient demographic or characteristic variables and patients’ willingness to pay out-of-pocket for an expedited ACLR {{both within and outside}} of Canada.|$|R
25|$|Ruter {{has stated}} that the {{estimated}} investment cost would be NOK10 billion, but that the tunnel would give high utility and {{would be one of}} the most economic investments they could make. There is no funding for a new tunnel in Oslo Package 3. By 2010, it was discovered that Oslo Package 3 was under-financed, and it is uncertain how much of the investment will be made by 2027. With the new tunnel being made a high priority by the city planners, this will either require additional grants from the municipality or the state, an increase in the toll fees, or the delay of investments in the program to a future Oslo Package 4. The left-wing parties have stated that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> delay or abandon several road projects to allocate financing to a new tunnel, while the right-wing parties have stated that they are not willing to allow road projects to be undermined.|$|E
500|$|In 1815, the {{government}} increased taxation on imported wheat and grain {{to help pay}} for the costs of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). Poor laws, such as the Speenhamland system, were designed to help alleviate financial distress of the poorer communities, but such systems helped to keep wages artificially low as the farmers knew labourers' wages would be supplemented by the system. Basic commodities, like cereals and bread, became heavily over-priced, creating widespread social unrest. The worst hit were the families of the men returning from the Battle of Waterloo (1815) who arrived home at a time when unemployment was already high. One reply to a questionnaire circulated by the Board of Agriculture in February, March, and April 1816 reported that [...] "the state of the labouring poor is very deplorable, and arises entirely from the want of employment, which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> seek, but the farmer cannot afford to furnish." ...|$|E
500|$|The two protagonists of {{the story}} are 5-Liu Hsing and 5-Nova Luis (known by their given names Hsing and Luis), with the [...] "5" [...] {{denoting}} that they {{are members of the}} fifth generation to be born aboard the ship (which is named Discovery). The environment of the spacecraft is highly controlled. Until the age of 7 all children roam naked, which presents no difficulties in a ship where temperature is controlled, and all disease-causing organisms have been eliminated. The population of the ship is also tightly controlled, at a figure of approximately 4,000. Individuals are required to get contraception injections every 25 days, unless <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make a pledge of chastity or strict homosexuality, or intend to conceive a child. All matter on the ship is carefully recycled, with no nonessential items ever lasting more than a few years, creating a [...] "static eternal ecology.|$|E

500|$|Dubois also ridicules {{the idea}} of {{inalienable}} rights, such as [...] "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness", arguing that people only have the rights that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> fight and die for in order to protect. The novel appeals to scientific authority to justify this position; Dubois repeatedly states that his argument is mathematically demonstrable, statements which have led scholars to label the novel [...] "hard science fiction", despite its social and political themes. The [...] "moral decline" [...] caused by this situation is depicted as having caused a global war between an alliance of the U.S., Britain, and Russia against the [...] "Chinese Hegemony" [...] in the year 1987. Despite the alliance between the U.S. and Russia, this war {{has been described as}} demonstrating Heinlein's anti-communist beliefs, which saw [...] "swarming hordes" [...] of Chinese as a bigger threat. The novel draws some comparisons between the Chinese and the Arachnids, and suggests that the lessons of one war could be applied to the other.|$|E
500|$|In {{evaluating}} {{the impact of}} the public's reaction to Parker's alleged 1999 rape of a fellow Penn State student, a film producer told The Hollywood Reporter, about Parker's directing career, [...] "His inability to act like he cared that people invested a whole lot of money in him — sorry. You go into the 'life is too short' category." [...] Noting that {{the first half of the}} New York Times review of The Birth of a Nation is taken up with the controversy, this person adds, [...] "No matter what Nate Parker makes, ... this will always be the first paragraph." [...] Other industry insiders note that, [...] "unlike Gibson — or Roman Polanski or Woody Allen, both accused of sexual assault (Polanski pled guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse) — Parker is just beginning his directing career and has not built up an acclaimed body of work that might encourage some to say <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> separate the artist from the art." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that Drayton and Brown were not seized and their consent to the search was voluntary. He explained that [...] "aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> listen". Additionally, Justice Kennedy emphasized that [...] "f a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized". Citing the Court's analytic framework established in Florida v. Bostic, Justice Kennedy concluded that a reasonable person would have felt free to [...] "leav the bus or otherwise terminat the encounter". Justice Kennedy noted that the officers did not brandish weapons, they did not make [...] "intimidating movements", they left the aisle clear, and they [...] "spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quiet voice". He noted that [...] "t is beyond question that had this encounter occurred on the street, it would be constitutional", {{and the fact that the}} encounter occurred on a bus does not make it illegal.|$|E
50|$|Following this, the {{researcher}} {{asked how much}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an origami built by an expert. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay more for the latter. The first test group were given a display of origami. It consisted of one set of origami they had built themselves and one set that had been built by experts. Without knowing that their own origami {{was part of the}} display as well, these subjects were asked to bid on the different origami. They perceived the origami they had created as being of equal quality to those created by professionals.|$|R
