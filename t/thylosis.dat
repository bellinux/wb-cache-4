40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the revealation of the hypervariable {{elements}} of the genome and its use for mapping and cloning of the genes of the man's hereditary diseases. The new families of the hypervariable repeaters of the man's DNA have been detected and investigated. The chromosome loci have been found and the genes-candidates, responsible for the <b>thylosis</b> and polymorphous cataract, have been determined. It has been found, that the mutagenous in these genes {{are responsible for the}} early form of the Altsheimer's disease.
