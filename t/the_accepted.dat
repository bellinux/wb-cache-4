5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations.

40|$|SUMMARY Inoue et al. {{introduced}} an automaton on a twodimensional tape, which decides acceptance or rejection of an input tape by scanning the tape from various sides by various automata which move one way, and investigated <b>the</b> <b>accepting</b> power {{of such an}} automaton. This paper continues the investigation {{of this type of}} automata, especially, ∨-type automata (obtained by combining four three-way two-dimensional deterministic finite automata (tr 2 -dfa’s) in “or ” fashion) and ∧-type automata (obtained by combining four tr 2 -dfa’s in “and ” fashion). We first investigate a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>accepting</b> powers of ∨-type automata and ∧-type automata, and show that they are incomparable. Then, we investigate a hierarchy of <b>the</b> <b>accepting</b> powers {{based on the number of}} tr 2 -dfa’s combined. Finally, we briefly describe a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>accepting</b> powers of automata obtained by combining three-way two-dimensional deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata. key words: two-dimensional tape, three-way deterministic finite automata, rotated inputs 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} reduction {{potential of}} the E°(No3+→No2+) couple was estimated in 1967 to be between +1.4and+1.5V; it was later found in 2009 to be only about +0.75V. The positive value shows that No2+ is more stable than No3+ and that No3+ is a good oxidizing agent. While the quoted values for the E°(No2+→No0) and E°(No3+→No0) vary among sources, <b>the</b> <b>accepted</b> standard estimates are −2.61and−1.26V. It has been predicted that the value for the E°(No4+→No3+) couple would be +6.5V. The Gibbs energies of formation for No3+ and No2+ {{are estimated to be}} −342and−480kJ·mol−1, respectively.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} olivaceous warbler records {{commenced}} in 1986, and {{continued through the}} 1990s. The results of this review were published in 1999: six of the previously accepted records were rejected as not meeting modern identification standards. In 2003, following the split of olivaceous warbler into two species, <b>the</b> <b>accepted</b> records were all reviewed again to ascertain {{which of the two}} they wereall nine proved to be eastern olivaceous warblers. Following the split of Bonelli's warbler into two species, the committee reviewed all the 121 accepted records, and concluded that 51 were western and two were eastern; for the remainder, not enough evidence was available to make a firm decision. The committee had previously stated that it would regard as western Bonelli's warbler all except proven eastern Bonelli's warblers, however, this announcement rescinded that decision. In 2003–04, all desert warbler records were reviewed, and it was concluded that all were referable to the newly split Asian desert warbler, rather than African desert warbler.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. <b>The</b> <b>accepted</b> design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to <b>the</b> <b>accepted</b> applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th century Ethiopian works {{began to}} discuss the {{profound}} impact of foreign peoples in their own regional history.

With the persuasion of Jesuits in his realm, emperor Susenyos I (r. 1607–1632) became the only Ethiopian ruler to convert from Orthodox Christianity to Catholicism, perhaps earlier than <b>the</b> <b>accepted</b> date of 1625, after which his attempts to convert his subjects and undermine the Orthodox church led to internal revolts. In 1593 the Ethiopian monk, historian, and ethnographer Bahrey published a work of ethnography that provided reasoning for the military success of the polytheistic Oromo people who fought against the Ethiopian Empire. Ethiopian histories of this period also included details of foreign Muslims, Jews, Christians (including those from Western Europe), Safavid Iranians, and even figures of the fallen Byzantine Empire.|$|E
