2500|$|The Convention {{established}} the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Any person who feels {{his or her}} rights have been violated under the Convention by a state party can take a case to the Court. Judgments finding violations are binding on <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>concerned</b> and they are obliged to execute them. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe monitors the execution of judgements, particularly to ensure payment of the amounts awarded by the Court to the applicants in {{compensation for the damage}} they have sustained. [...] The compensations imposed under ECHR can be rather large; in 2014 Russia was ordered to pay in excess of $2 billion in damages to former shareholders of Yukos.|$|E
6000|$|Rivers which, in {{the words}} of the Treaty, [...] "naturally provide more than one State with access to the sea," [...] {{properly}} require some measure of international regulation and adequate guarantees against discrimination. This principle has long been recognized in the International Commissions which regulate the Rhine and the Danube. But on such Commissions <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>concerned</b> should be represented more or less in proportion to their interests. The Treaty, however, has made the international character of these rivers a pretext for taking the river system of Germany out of German control.|$|E
60|$|This great mass of {{political}} matter {{must have been}} always under the view of thinkers for the public, whether they act in office or not. Amongst events, even the late calamitous events were {{in the book of}} contingency. Of course they must have been in design, at least, provided for. A plan which takes in as many as possible of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>concerned</b> will rather tend to facilitate and simplify a rational scheme for preserving Spain (if that were our sole, as I think it ought to be our principal object) than to delay and perplex it.|$|E

It is hoped that the importance of the object and the benefits to flow therefrom will secure the speedy approval and legislative sanction of <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>concerned.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{have still}} a very long road to travel before we arrive at the {{establishment}} of an international authority, but it is not very difficult to foresee the steps by which this result will be gradually reached. There {{is likely to be a}} continual increase in the practice of submitting disputes to arbitration, and in the realization that the supposed conflicts of interest between different states are mainly illusory. Even where there is a real conflict of interest, it must in time become obvious that neither of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>concerned</b> would suffer as much by giving way as by fighting. With the progress of inventions, war, when it does occur, is bound to become increasingly destructive. The civilized races of the world are faced with the alternative of coöperation or mutual destruction. The present war is making this alternative daily more evident. And it is difficult to believe that, when the enmities which it has generated have had time to cool, civilized men will deliberately choose to destroy civilization, rather than acquiesce in the abolition of war.|$|E
