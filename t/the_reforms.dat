Theoretical basis are the theories about teachers' beliefs and attitudes and a belief system according to Paul A. Sabatier. The teachers' approach to <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is defined as their acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> and <b>the</b> extent of their activities in <b>the</b> <b>reform.</b> <b>The</b> teachers' acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is formulated in two dimensions. The first one is teachers' acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> objectives. <b>The</b> other one is teachers' acceptance of the new teacher role as a co-creator of the curriculum. The teachers' attitudes appear to be mainly problematic in the second category which deals to formalism of <b>the</b> <b>reform.</b> As main reasons of teachers' disagreement on <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> were identified <b>the</b> problems in <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> implementation phase, teachers' ideological opposition to <b>the</b> <b>reform,</b> inadequate explanation of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> meaning by central authorities, which leads to a misunderstanding of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> objectives by teachers, and an implementation of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Henry's reign saw {{significant}} legal changes, {{particularly in}} England and Normandy.

Despite these reforms it is uncertain if Henry had a grand vision for his new legal system and <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> seem to have proceeded in a steady, pragmatic fashion. Indeed, in most cases he was probably not personally responsible for creating the new processes, but he was greatly interested in the law, seeing the delivery of justice as one of the key tasks for a king and carefully appointing good administrators to conduct <b>the</b> <b>reforms.</b>|$|E

30|$|The good {{conditions}} {{around the}} time of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> indicate that <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> was exogenous. <b>The</b> average real GDP growth was 3.3 %, and the unemployment rate was 4.7 % from 1997 to 2002 (data from Instituto Nacional de Estatistica).

Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, as well as their law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly.
