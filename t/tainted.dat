40|$|Abstract — <b>Taint</b> {{analysis}} {{has a wide}} variety of applications in software analysis, making the precision of <b>taint</b> analysis an important consideration. Current <b>taint</b> analysis algorithms, including previous work on bit-precise <b>taint</b> analyses, suffer from shortcomings that can lead to significant loss of precision (under/over <b>tainting)</b> in some situations. This paper discusses these limitations of existing <b>taint</b> analysis algorithms, shows how they can lead to imprecise <b>taint</b> propagation, and proposes a generalization of current bit-level <b>taint</b> analysis techniques to address these problems and improve their precision. Experiments using a deobfuscation tool indicate that our enhanced <b>taint</b> analysis algorithm leads to significant improvements in the quality of deobfuscation. I...|$|R

40|$|A {{reduction}} in boar <b>taint,</b> an unpleasant odor arising in pork from some intact males, is desirable if routine castration of piglets {{needs to be}} stopped. Commercial slaughter pigs are typically crosses between sire lines mainly selected for finishing traits and dam lines mainly selected for reproduction traits. Previous studies suggest the possibility of reducing boar <b>taint</b> in sire lines due to favorable genetic correlations between boar <b>taint</b> and finishing traits. However, there are indications of unfavorable genetic associations between boar <b>taint</b> and female reproduction traits, but a lack of genetic correlation estimates remain a major roadblock in reducing boar <b>taint</b> in dam lines. This {{study was conducted to}} estimate genetic correlations between boar <b>taint</b> traits and female reproduction traits, investigate differences in these genetic relationships among sire and dam lines, and evaluate possible consequences of selection against boar <b>taint</b> in dam lines. The data consisted of 32, 549 reproduction records from a Landrace dam line, 23, 874 records from a Yorkshire dam line, and 3, 745 records from a Pietrain sire line. Androstenone, skatole, and indole were measured on 1, 896 carcasses, and human nose scores were recorded on 7, 742 carcass samples. In general, the level of boar <b>taint</b> was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) in the two dam lines than in the sire line. A majority of genetic correlations of boar <b>taint</b> compounds with reproduction traits were either low or nonsignificant, except for those of skatole and indole, with age at first insemination in dam lines that were – 0. 32 and – 0. 46, respectively. Genetic correlations also differed (P < 0. 05) between sire and dam lines. The consequences of selection against boar <b>taint</b> in dam lines were evaluated, using selection indexes based on reproduction traits only, boar <b>taint</b> traits only, and both boar <b>taint</b> and reproduction traits. Selection on an index of only reproduction traits increased the number of carcasses with boar <b>taint</b> from 4 to 7. 3 % in 5 generations.

40|$|<b>Taint</b> {{analysis}} {{has a wide}} variety of compelling applica-tions in security tasks, from software attack detection to data lifetime analysis. Static <b>taint</b> analysis propagates <b>taint</b> values following all possible paths with no need for concrete execution, but is generally less accurate than dynamic analysis. Unfortunately, the high performance penalty incurred by dynamic <b>taint</b> analyses makes its de-ployment impractical in production systems. To amelio-rate this performance bottleneck, recent research efforts aim to decouple data flow tracking logic from program execution. We continue this line of research in this paper and propose pipelined symbolic <b>taint</b> analysis, a novel technique for parallelizing and pipelining <b>taint</b> analy-sis to take advantage of ubiquitous multi-core platforms. We have developed a prototype system called TaintPipe. TaintPipe performs very lightweight runtime logging to produce compact control flow profiles, and spawns mul-tiple threads as different stages of a pipeline to carry out symbolic <b>taint</b> analysis in parallel. Our experiments show that TaintPipe imposes low overhead on applica-tion runtime performance and accelerates <b>taint</b> analysis significantly. Compared to a state-of-the-art inlined dy-namic data flow tracking tool, TaintPipe achieves 2. 38 times speedup for <b>taint</b> analysis on SPEC 2006 and 2. 43 times for a set of common utilities, respectively. In ad-dition, we demonstrate the strength of TaintPipe such as natural support of multi-tag <b>taint</b> analysis with several security applications. ...|$|R
