40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>air</b> <b>throttling</b> on flame {{stabilization}} of an ethylene fueled scramjet combustor was investigated by numerical simulation and experiments in this paper. The results were obtained under the inflow condition with Mach number of 2. 0, total temperature of 900 [*]K, total pressure of 0. 8 [*]MPa, and total equivalence ratio of 0. 5. The shock train generated by <b>air</b> <b>throttling</b> {{had a big}} effect on the flow structure of the scramjet combustor. Compared with the combustor without <b>air</b> <b>throttling,</b> the flow field with <b>air</b> <b>throttling</b> had a lower velocity and higher pressure, temperature, and vortices intensity. <b>Air</b> <b>throttling</b> was {{an effective way to}} achieve flame stabilization; the combustion in the combustor without <b>air</b> <b>throttling</b> was nearly blowout. In the experiment, the combustion was nearly blowout with <b>air</b> <b>throttling</b> location of 745 [*]mm, and the fuel/air mixture in the combustor with <b>air</b> <b>throttling</b> location of 875 [*]mm was burned intensively. It was important to choose the location and time sequence of <b>air</b> <b>throttling</b> for fuel ignition and flame stabilization.

50|$|Turbofans {{are usually}} more {{efficient}} than turbojets at subsonic speeds, but their large frontal area also generates more drag. Therefore, in supersonic flight, and in military and other aircraft where absolute performance, weight, and drag have a higher priority than fuel efficiency, engines tend to either have smaller fans (or multiple smaller fans) or use other engine designs entirely. Typically, turbofans in civilian aircraft usually have a pronounced large front area to accommodate a very large fan, as their design involves a much larger mass of <b>air</b> <b>bypassing</b> the core so they can benefit from these effects, while in military aircraft, where noise and efficiency are less important compared to performance and drag, a smaller amount of <b>air</b> typically <b>bypasses</b> the core. Turbofans designed for subsonic civilian aircraft also usually have a just a single front fan, because their additional thrust is generated by a large additional mass of air which is only moderately compressed, rather than a smaller amount of air which is greatly compressed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{turbofan}} or fanjet {{is a type}} of airbreathing {{jet engine}} that is widely used in aircraft propulsion. The word [...] "turbofan" [...] is a portmanteau of [...] "turbine" [...] and [...] "fan": the turbo portion refers to a gas turbine engine which achieves mechanical energy from combustion, and the fan, a ducted fan that uses the mechanical energy from the gas turbine to accelerate air rearwards. Thus, whereas all the air taken in by a turbojet passes through the turbine (through the combustion chamber), in a turbofan some of that <b>air</b> <b>bypasses</b> the turbine. A turbofan thus {{can be thought of as}} a turbojet being used to drive a ducted fan, with both of those contributing to the thrust. The ratio of the mass-flow of <b>air</b> <b>bypassing</b> the engine core compared to the mass-flow of air passing through the core is referred to as the bypass ratio. The engine produces thrust through a combination of these two portions working together; engines that use more jet thrust relative to fan thrust are known as low-bypass turbofans, conversely those that have considerably more fan thrust than jet thrust are known as high-bypass. Most commercial aviation jet engines in use today are of the high-bypass type, and most modern military fighter engines are low-bypass. Afterburners are not used on high-bypass turbofan engines but may be used on either low-bypass turbofan or turbojet engines.|$|R
