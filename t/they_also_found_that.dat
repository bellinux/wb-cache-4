5|$|An {{analysis}} by British staff {{officers of the}} initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow-charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank's armour, the weapon became much less effective.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that discussions over different types of deicing fluid were discussed, along with different deicing equipment and techniques. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the pilot in command was the ultimate authority for take off decisions, but that all operators had to provide proper training and criteria for the pilot in command to base a proper decision on.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people should}} like their name. Those {{that do not}} should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name {{relatively}} highly. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.|$|E

5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Gascoigne and {{astronomer}} Gerald Kron used newly modernised telescopes at Mount Stromlo {{to determine}} that the distance between our galaxy and the Magellanic Cloud dwarf galaxies had been underestimated {{by a factor of}} two. Because this measurement was used to calibrate other distances in astronomy, the result effectively doubled the estimated size of the universe. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the Milky Way; this overturned the prevailing view that both had evolved in parallel. A major figure at Mount Stromlo Observatory, Gascoigne helped it develop from a solar observatory to a centre of stellar and galactic research, and was instrumental in the creation of its field observatory in northern New South Wales, Siding Spring Observatory. When the British and Australian governments agreed to jointly build the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring, Gascoigne was involved from its initial conception and throughout its lengthy commissioning, taking its first photograph. Gascoigne was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for his contributions to astronomy and to the Anglo-Australian Telescope.|$|E

With the help of U.S. Attorney Hillary Stein (Hoffmann), they took Guzman's operation down. However, they were never able to locate Vinnie and he was presumed afterward to have been killed by the death squad.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{effect of}} {{household}} composition and size on food {{consumption in the}} rural and urban areas of Turkey through equivalence scales that vary by household member age. Food consumption studies on Turkey have tended to ignore the impact of household composition in consumption traditionally analyses of food consumption are conducted on a per capita basis. Equivalence scales were estimated by Engel method using Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) data of the State Institute of Statistics. This data covers 26, 166 households. The results indicate; while household size increases per capita food expenditure decreases in both rural and urban areas of Turkey. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>founded</b> <b>that</b> cost of additional one child is decreasing by children age as going to older. This cost is much lower in rural are than urban area of Turkey. It is frequently stated {{in the literature of}} poverty that the level and severity of poverty is higher in rural areas than urban areas. Therefore, the finding of this study shows that in rural areas, the cost of per person for obtaining the certain standard of living is lower than in urban areas in Turkey...|$|R

5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer {{roosting}} locations of this species, as well as where maternal colonies are formed, which makes a proper species distribution estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer roosting habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> females roosting sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than male’s roosts. Females who have young require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer roosting habitats are very difficult to find, and may be threatened by mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create roosting sites for the species.|$|E

25|$|The {{findings}} of Mark Levine and Simon Crowther (2008) illustrated that increasing group size inhibited intervention in a street violence scenario when bystanders were strangers, but encouraged intervention when bystanders were friends. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when gender identity is salient, group size encouraged intervention when bystanders and victims shared social category membership. In addition, group size interacted with context-specific norms that both inhibit and encourage helping. The bystander effect {{is not a}} generic consequence of increasing group size. When bystanders share group-level psychological relationships, group size can encourage as well as inhibit helping.|$|E
