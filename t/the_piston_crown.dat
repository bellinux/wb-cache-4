[...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the valve head to <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> and secondly, greater effort is required to move the valve springs to a higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting. Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.|$|E

50|$|The 2.8 {{gained a}} bad {{reputation}} early in its career due to a tendency for excessive carbon deposits to accumulate on <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crowns</b> during low-speed running, which would burn through the crowns when run at higher revs. This was later cured by a switch to stronger <b>pistons</b> but <b>the</b> engine was also a mediocre performer offering no real economy benefit and it was dropped in 1973, {{to be replaced by}} the ‘new’ 3.4.|$|R
5000|$|The later 16-valve engines {{were part}} of FIAT's [...] "Pratola Serra" [...] (B family) modular engine series, and had a heavier {{cast-iron}} block engine, with an alloy head, and the camshafts were belt driven. The Twin Spark name {{comes from the fact}} that there are two spark plugs per cylinder. It was cast iron for its higher beam strength, less complexity and hence lower production costs.

50|$|The WHE-25 design used a reed valve, {{which is}} a piece of thin metal {{covering}} the top of the piston (as shown in the figure). The WHE-DR design replaced the reed with a ball resting in a valve seat in <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The engine airbox covers (the upper covers {{observed}} {{on the side}} of an EMD engine - they cover the [...] "airbox" [...] that allows air to flow through the cylinder block to the power assemblies) are removed to allow visual inspection of the inside of the cylinder liners and <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crowns,</b> skirts and rings. The crankcase access covers (the lower covers {{observed on}} the side of an EMD engine) are also removed to inspect for coolant leakage, damaged components and excessive wear.

50|$|Koreyvo, Jumo and Napier Deltic engines {{used one}} piston per {{cylinder}} to expose an intake port, {{and the other}} to expose an exhaust port. Each piston is referred to as either an intake piston or an exhaust piston depending on its function in this regard.

5000|$|In {{an engine}} {{designed}} {{to use the}} squish effect, at top dead centre (TDC) <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> comes very close, (typically less than 1 mm), to the cylinder head.

50|$|CI {{engines that}} use a blower {{typically}} use uniflow scavenging. In this design the cylinder wall contains several intake ports placed uniformly spaced along the circumference {{just above the}} position that <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> reaches when at BDC. An exhaust valve or several like that of 4-stroke engines is used. The final part of the intake manifold is an air sleeve which feeds the intake ports. The intake ports are placed at an horizontal angle to the cylinder wall (I.e: they are in plane of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown)</b> to give a swirl to the incoming charge to improve combustion. The largest reciprocating IC are low speed CI engines of this type; they are used for marine propulsion (see marine diesel engine) or electric power generation and achieve the highest thermal efficiencies among internal combustion engines of any kind. Some Diesel-electric locomotive engines operate on the 2-stroke cycle. The most powerful {{of them have a}} brake power of around 4.5 MW or 6,000 HP. The EMD SD90MAC class of locomotives use a 2-stroke engine. The comparable class GE AC6000CW whose prime mover has almost the same brake power uses a 4-stroke engine.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, the German {{engineer}} Adolf Schnürle {{developed the}} system of ports that bears his name. The ports were relocated to both {{be on the same}} side of the cylinder, with the transfer port being split into two angled ports, one on either side of the exhaust port. A deflector piston was no longer required.

50|$|This {{direct-drive}} aero-engine {{is unusual}} in two respects: it is very oversquare with a bore:stroke ratio of 1.295:1, {{and it has a}} side-valve valvetrain. The designer determined that since maximum continuous power output (65.3kW) was to be developed at only 2800 rpm, the extra weight and complexity of overhead valves would be superfluous. The resulting engine is compact and lightweight, with a dry weight of 58 kg, and a maximum power-to-weight ratio of 1.09 kW/kg (wet; coolant fluids weigh 5 kg).The engine uses fuel injection, so carburetor heat is unnecessary. Lubrication is by dry sump, with an external oil tank. Dual ignition is used, each cylinder having twin spark plugs sited between the valves and <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crowns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of sodium in {{a ratio of}} 1:3 gives the lowest melting point and must be avoided. This melting point of 535 °C can cause problems on the hot spots of <b>the</b> engine like <b>piston</b> <b>crowns,</b> valve seats, and turbochargers.|$|R
50|$|The {{air cell}} {{is a small}} {{cylindrical}} chamber {{with a hole in}} one end. It is mounted more or less coaxially with the injector, said axis being parallel to <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> with the injector firing across a small cavity which is open to the cylinder into the hole in the end of the air cell. The air cell is mounted so as to minimise thermal contact with the mass of the head. A pintle injector with a narrow spray pattern is used. At TDC the majority of the charge mass is contained in the cavity and air cell.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the heat}} and {{pressure}} of combustion is applied to one specific point on the piston as it exits the precombustion chamber or swirl chamber, such engines are less suited to high specific power outputs (such as turbocharging or tuning) than direct injection diesels. The increased temperature and pressure on one part of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> causes uneven expansion {{which can lead to}} cracking, distortion or other damage due to improper use; use of [...] " [...] starting fluid" [...] (ether) is not recommended in glow plug, indirect injection systems, because explosive knock can occur, causing engine damage.|$|E

5000|$|Cams {{that have}} {{excessive}} valve lift, running at high rpm, can cause {{what is called}} [...] "valve float", where the valve spring tension is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex.

This is typically what happens when a motor over revs. This is where the engine rpm exceeds the maximum design rpm. The valve train is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily.

5000|$|Once {{the flow}} has stopped, the booster is started, {{and as the}} piston withdraws along the cylinder, {{increasing}} the volume between the cylinder head and <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port.

At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{unlike other}} rotaries, the early Gnome engines like the Gnome Omega, Lambda and Delta used a unique {{arrangement}} of valves in order to eliminate pushrods that operated during the inlet phase of the combustion cycle on more conventional engines. Instead, a single exhaust valve on the cylinder head was operated by a pushrod that opened the valve when the pressure dropped {{at the end of}} the power stroke. A pressure-operated inlet valve, which was balanced by a counterweight to equalize the centrifugal forces, was placed in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> where it opened to allow the fuel-air charge to enter from the engine's central crankcase.|$|E
50|$|The Endura-DI engine {{features}} a cast iron block and direct injection style cylinder head, {{which means the}} combustion chamber is {{in the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown.</b> This engine makes use of aluminium for many other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening 8 valves via shim-and-bucket followers, and the camshaft is driven by a toothed belt which is driven from a sprocket on the diesel injection pump; unusually this pump is driven via gemini (twin) chains from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is an electronically controlled rotary distributor type most typically made by Bosch.|$|E

40|$|The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation to investigate <b>the</b> effect of <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> shape to air motion characteristics of an internal combustion engine is presented in this paper. The in-cylinder air motion before the fuel injection event {{plays an important role}} to the generation of swirl and tumble flows due to the high turbulence during the intake and compression strokes. Swirl is generated by the suction of air flow into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke and greatly enhances the mixing of air and fuel to yield either a homogeneous or stratified mixture inside the cylinder. On the other hand, tumble plays an essential role in producing the compression ratio required for rapid combustion process. The characteristics of swirl and tumble flows inside cylinder of engine can be expressed in the form of swirl and tumble ratios. Two different <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> shapes for homogeneous and stratified are carried out to determine the swirl and tumble ratio generated inside engine cylinder for selected events based on crank angle. The simulation was performed {{from the beginning of the}} intake stroke until a moment in the compression stroke just before the fuel injection process begins. Swirl and tumble ratios obtained from the simulation will determine <b>the</b> optimum <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> to be used for better air motion features and combustion to gain the optimum operating condition for such engine...|$|R
40|$|For {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of the highly unsteady near-wall boundary layer flows in internal combustion (IC) engines, PIV-based flow field measurements close to the inner cylinder and piston walls within transparent engines are required. The herein described flying PIV method in combination with a scanning light-sheet provides time-resolved PIV measurements in a transparent IC engine water analogue in a radial plane 1. 5 [*]mm apart from <b>the</b> planar <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> while <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> is moving. <b>The</b> light-sheet is parallel to <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> surface and moves with <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> thanks to <b>the</b> scanning technique that synchronizes the sheet motion with <b>the</b> non-linear <b>piston</b> motion. A compact high speed camera is positioned within <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> shaft below <b>the</b> transparent <b>piston</b> head and records the particle fields within the illuminated plane in time-resolved manner.

5000|$|The {{drop-forged steel}} six-throw {{crankshaft}} runs in seven main bearings; unlike {{the majority of}} wide angle V6 engines which have only four main bearings. [...] The connecting rod bearing journals are offset 22° to one another. [...] Two overhead camshafts (OHCs) operate the automatic hydraulic valve lifters which, in turn, open and close the 39.0 mm intake and 34.3 mm exhaust valves. Since the two 'rows' of pistons and cylinders share a single cylinder head and head gasket, <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> (or top surface) is tilted. Intake and exhaust valves need different camshafts to vary valve overlap (they may be coaxial like in some 90° V8).|$|E
5000|$|The {{camshaft}} [...] "lift" [...] is {{the resultant}} net {{rise of the}} valve from its seat. The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. Greater lift has some limitations.

Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting. Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.|$|E
5000|$|The high {{performance}} Combat engine gave [...] at 6,500 rpm using 10 :1 compression ratio. It {{was too much}} for the stretched old 1949 500 cc-based design, with main bearing failures and broken pistons being reported in the press, along with quality control issues.The solution to the main bearing problems was the much-fabled [...] "Superblend" [...] bearings, although these were in reality just a higher load capacity roller bearing. The piston issues were resolved by removing the slot for oil drainage behind the oil ring, and drilling a series of holes instead, so that <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> didn't separate from the piston at higher RPMs.|$|E
5000|$|Rover used a more {{advanced}} form of IOE engine. It was designed by Jack Swain in the mid-late 1940s and was in production from 1948 to the early 1990s. Unlike the conventional F-head IOE, this had an efficient combustion chamber designed for good combustion, rather than simple manufacture. The top surface of the block was machined at an angle, with <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>crowns</b> angled in a [...] "pitched roof" [...] to match. At TDC, <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> almost touched <b>the</b> angled inlet valve and provided good 'squish' to the combustion chamber itself, offset to the side by half a cylinder diameter. The resultant combustion chamber shape was a near-ideal hemisphere, although inverted and tilted from the usual [...] "hemi-head" [...] design. The spark plug was centrally mounted and this, together with the turbulence generated by the squish, provided a short flame path. The thinness of the gas layer between piston and inlet valve was so confined as {{to reduce the risk}} of detonation on poor fuel, one factor that kept it in service with Land Rover for so long. During the late 1940s and early 1950s when the only petrol available was low octane 'pool' petrol it also allowed Rover to run higher compression ratios than many competitors with the more usual side- or overhead valve designs.|$|R
50|$|A new-generation straight-6 F-head (overhead inlet, {{side exhaust}} valve) it {{differed}} from its predecessor by having redesigned big end and main bearings using an improved alloy, improved tappets {{and a more}} efficient drive to <b>the</b> timing gear. <b>Piston</b> <b>crowns</b> were raised and rectangular combustion chambers provided. Externally an oil filter was mounted on the forward right hand side. Without a beam axle the engine could be mounted further forward and particular care was taken to mount it so as to minimise noise and vibration to the passengers.|$|R
50|$|These engines {{all used}} a {{two-stroke}} cycle with twelve pistons sharing six cylinders, <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> to <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> in an opposed piston configuration. This unusual configuration required two crankshafts, {{one at the}} bottom of the cylinder block and the other at the top, geared together. <b>The</b> <b>pistons</b> moved towards each other during the operating cycle. Intake and exhaust manifolds were duplicated on both sides of the block. There were two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder, each feeding two nozzles, for 4 nozzles per cylinder in all.|$|R
