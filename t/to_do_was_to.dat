5|$|The {{development}} team {{struggled in}} devising gameplay features {{that would be}} enjoyed by the fans of the series. One of the hardest tasks chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki was assigned <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attract people who had no prior experience with the series; he {{decided to make the}} gameplay as simple as possible. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto presented the staff with a variety of opinions which they in turn would have to incorporate into the game the best way possible. Miyamoto let the team decide which graphics they wanted to use without restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident {{in the first week of}} June 1917.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with the Times Higher Education, Andrew May, the Director of Estates, Hospitality and Contract Services at the University of Hertfordshire has asserted that what the University aims <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use the estates strategy as the delivery vehicle for driving corporate and cultural change. In 1992, it established University of Hertfordshire Press, whose first publication was a book celebrating the institution's change in status from polytechnic to university.|$|E
25|$|La Luz was {{eventually}} {{expelled from the}} Puerto Rico Socialist Party because his ideals no longer aligned with the organization.

25|$|For many, their {{religious}} beliefs were not even left untouched by the communist influence. Those who practice Buddhism, {{as well as the}} Dali Lama, were not safe from harm at this time. It came {{to the point where the}} Chinese government had caused a suppression of religion and in the end felt threatened by the Dali Lama. What the Chinese government had thought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> kidnap and harm him. India ended up being the country that provided the safest land for the Tibetans and the Dali Lama who wanted to practice Buddhism in peace and be safe at the same time.|$|E
25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E
25|$|There {{once took}} place a great {{competition}} between the Devas to decide who among them should {{be the head of}} the Gana (the troops of semi-gods at the service of Shiva). The competitors were required to circle the world as fast as possible and return to the Feet of Parvati. The gods took off, each on his or her own vehicle, and even Ganesha participated with enthusiasm in the race; but he was extremely heavy and was riding on a mouse! Naturally, his pace was remarkably slow and this was a great disadvantage. He had not yet made much headway when there appeared before him the sage Narada (son of Brahma), who asked him where he was going. Ganesha was very annoyed and went into a rage because it was considered unlucky to encounter a solitary Brahmin just {{at the beginning of a}} voyage. Notwithstanding the fact that Narada was the greatest of Brahmins, son of Brahma himself, this was still a bad omen. Moreover, it wasn't considered a good sign to be asked where one was heading when one was already on the way to some destination; therefore, Ganesha felt doubly unfortunate. Nonetheless, the great Brahmin succeeded in calming his fury. Ganesha explained to him the motives for his sadness and his terrible desire to win. Narada consoled and exhorted him not to despair; he said that for a child, the whole world was embodied within the mother , so all Ganesha had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> circle his Parvati and he would defeat those who had more speed but less understanding.|$|E

Liz enters Tracy's {{dressing}} room—with the mustache intact—to take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz {{had been looking for}} her.

500|$|Tallahatchie County Sheriff Clarence Strider, who {{initially}} positively identified Till's body {{and stated that}} the case against Milam and Bryant was [...] "pretty good", on September 3 announced his doubts that the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River was that of Till. He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The last thing I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> defend those peckerwoods.

500|$|With {{a modest}} income secured, Holst {{was able to}} marry Isobel; the {{ceremony}} was at Fulham Register Office on 22 June 1901. Their marriage lasted until his death; there was one child, Imogen, born in 1907. In 1902 Dan Godfrey and the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra premiered Holst's symphony The Cotswolds (Op. 8), the slow movement {{of which is a}} lament for William Morris who had died in October 1896, three years before Holst began work on the piece. In 1903 Adolph von Holst died, leaving a small legacy. Holst and his wife decided, as Imogen later put it, that [...] "as they were always hard up the only thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> spend it all at once on a holiday in Germany".|$|E

500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Ramsey joined Ipswich {{just after}} the club's relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1954–55 season, the team's only year above the third tier up to that point. To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the first thing I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> forget my set ideas on how football ought to be played. My experience had been in the First Division. I soon found that what I faced at Ipswich was very different." ...|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki was {{inspired}} to create The Wind Rises after reading a quote from Horikoshi: [...] "All I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make something beautiful". Several scenes in The Wind Rises were inspired by Tatsuo Hori's novel , in which Hori wrote about his life experiences with his fiancée before she died from tuberculosis. The female lead character's name, Naoko Satomi, was borrowed from Hori's novel [...] The Wind Rises continues to reflect Miyazaki's pacifist stance, continuing the themes of his earlier works, despite stating that condemning war was not {{the intention of the}} film. The film premiered on July 20, 2013, and received critical acclaim; it was named Animation of the Year at the 37th Japan Academy Prize, and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. It was also commercially successful, grossing ¥11.6 billion (US$110 million) at the Japanese box office, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2013.|$|E

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> do our work well." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared to the {{graphical}} changes, {{the artificial}} intelligence (AI) of the computer-controlled characters {{was only slightly}} changed. The justification given was that the team felt the AI worked very well for the first game. All they had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> tweak it a little and fix some bugs. There was, however, {{a lot of work}} done in improving the multiplayer portion of the game. For FreeSpace 2, the player's personal computer was assigned a greater role in predicting the possible consequences for other players' actions. This reduced the amount of data needed to be transferred between the computers, which would result in a smoother playing experience. Beta testers were recruited to stress test and troubleshoot the multiplayer mode as well. SquadWar was implemented as an attempt to establish a sense of continuity among the players {{in the form of a}} persistent online territorial fight, along with pilot statistics and ladder rankings. Volition hoped this concept would help to establish a strong, online community and build up the game's lifespan. The process of fixing the bugs detected was even publicly published on the game's official website as the [...] "Bug Fix of the Day" [...] feature.|$|E
500|$|The zduhaći, {{the dragon}} men, {{and the related}} folkloric figures of Europe can be {{compared}} with Eurasian shamans, e.g., the noaidi of the Lapps, {{as well as the}} shamans of the Samoyeds and Tungus in Siberia. They were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against the enemies of their community. The shamans also fought against each other, usually in animal form, for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible. However, for a shaman's soul to leave his body, he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming, dancing, chanting, and even taking narcotics. All the zduhaći had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> fall asleep, although the unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy. There are detailed and eventful descriptions of the journey of the shaman's soul, but no corresponding accounts exist {{in the case of the}} zduhaći. However, the zduhaći who left their bodies were said to have gone into the winds. This expression may contain an idea of a journey. Pavel Rovinski recorded the words he heard from his landlady in Montenegro on a windy night in March: [...] "Listen, how they sing—the travellers; they have gone high high! Happy journey to them!" ...|$|E
