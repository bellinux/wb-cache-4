5|$|Utagawa Toyoharu (歌川 豊春, – 1814) was a Japanese {{artist in}} the ukiyo-e genre, known as {{the founder of the}} Utagawa school and for his uki-e {{pictures}} that incorporated Western-style geometrical perspective <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of depth.|$|E
5|$|Team {{cohesion}} {{is viewed}} as ‘‘a general indicator of synergistic group interaction—or process’’. Furthermore, cohesion {{has been linked to}} greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions. Team efficacy refers to team members’ perceptions of task-specific team competence. This construct is thought <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of confidence within the team that enables the group to persevere when faced with hardship.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of realism, Scott and Washington interviewed {{numerous}} men {{and women}} whose real-life occupations pertained to positions in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Washington has noted that he and Scott conducted similar research during the productions of Man on Fire and Crimson Tide.|$|E

40|$|Architecture, vegetation, light, smells, foods or people's {{clothing}} {{can contribute}} <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of place. From 'outside', the tropics are {{commonly associated with}} palm trees, white sandy beaches, turquoise blue water and bright sunlight. The tropics 'inside' are a social product with particular locales, shared experiences and meaning–places await to be explored. Roads are connecting us. Fly-in Fly-out is a characteristic of Townsville. People driving long distance to and from work. On each end are emotions, experiences not shared in this instance...|$|R
5|$|While {{developing}} the story, {{members of the}} Studios confronted Hergé with concerns about elements of Tintin in Tibet. Bob de Moor feared the scene in which Haddock crashes into a stupa was disrespectful to Buddhists. Jacques van Melkebeke suggested that the Yeti not be depicted <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of enigma; Hergé disagreed, believing that it would disappoint his child readers.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of realism for the storyline, {{principal}} CNN news outlet commentators were scripted into Contact. More than 25 news reporters from CNN had {{roles in the}} film and the CNN programs Larry King Live and Crossfire were also included. Ann Druyan makes a cameo appearance as herself, debating with Rob Lowe's character, Richard Rank, on Crossfire. In January 1997, a second unit was sent to Puerto Rico for one week at the Arecibo Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of {{extremely}} short shots, {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of isolation.|$|E
50|$|As Ukraine is a newly {{independent}} state, this serves <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> common <b>sense</b> of identity of Ukraine and Israel as nations who gained their {{independence in the}} 20th century.|$|R

50|$|In the meantime, counter-revolutionary ideas flourished {{amongst the}} leaders of the Welsh Methodist revival, but the {{consequences}} of turning Wales into a nation with a nonconformist majority was <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new <b>sense</b> of Welshness.|$|R
5|$|The public's {{thirst for}} news and {{information}} was in part satisfied by news magazines, which were dedicated to reporting the war. They included amongst others The War Illustrated, The Illustrated War News, and The War Pictorial, and were lavishly filled with photographs and illustrations, regardless of their target audience. Magazines were produced for all classes, and ranged both in price and tone. Many otherwise famous writers contributed towards these publications, of which H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling were three examples. Editorial guidelines varied; in cheaper publications especially it was considered more important <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of patriotism than to relay up-to-the-minutes news of developments of the front. Stories of German atrocities were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference {{owing to the}} confusion and lack of decision of the Spanish Republican side. The massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat airlift and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There was a massive purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
5|$|Moakes has {{indicated}} that there was no worry about whether a song could be recreated live in concert {{in the same way as}} it would appear on record. A brass section and a chamber choir were hired as additional musicians. Drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat. Okereke's voice was often used as an instrument by being looped, vocoded, or run through effects pedals.|$|E
40|$|Motivational aspects are core to {{successful}} knowledge sharing and collaborative learning experiences. However, it still {{remains one of}} the great challenges to overcome motivational barriers when it comes to introducing information systems for collaborative learning at the workplace. In the context of an international research project we have taken motivational aspects into account during the design phase and started a participatory process involving researchers, end-users, managers, designers and developers. As initial findings show, a continuous dialogue with end-users may contribute <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of ownership amongst them and become a motivational driver for the future use of the system...|$|R
5000|$|Regional {{heritage}} is physical environments, {{as perceived by}} humans.

500|$|Upon its release, {{contemporary}} critical {{opinion was}} largely positive. Bob Martin, editor of Fangoria, reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it [...] "might be {{the exception to}} the usual run of low-budget horror films". The Los Angeles Times called the film an [...] "instant classic", proclaiming it as [...] "probably the grisliest well-made movie ever." [...] In a 1982 review, staff from the trade magazine Variety wrote that the film [...] "emerges as the ne plus ultra of low-budget gore and shock effect", commenting that the [...] "powerful" [...] and inventive camerawork was key <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of dread.|$|R
5|$|Watts' {{performances}} in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts {{in his first season}} was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of hope for long-suffering fans. Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not living up to his potential.|$|E
5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. <b>To</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E

25|$|A {{reviewer}} {{commented that}} the interweaving of characters from Pelecanos' other novels gives {{a sense of place}} and a story larger than the novels themselves. Pelecanos has commented that he deliberately interweaves characters from his novels <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of a fictional universe that parallels the real world.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the retail}} environment, {{different}} spaces may be designed for different purposes. Hard floors, such as wooden floors, used in public areas, contrast with carpeted fitting rooms, which are designed <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of homeliness when trying on garments. Peter Alexander, retailer of sleep ware, is renowned for using scented candles in retail stores.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2013 {{the company}} adopted {{a new group}} global logo mark [...] "that will be shared among all global group {{companies}} as <b>a</b> symbol <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> greater <b>sense</b> of unity while helping to convey a stronger global market presence for the Furukawa brand".|$|R
40|$|Student affairs {{personnel}} are often {{charged with the}} task of <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of community on campuses. Sports is among the many activities that historically have been used to meet this need for community among students. Yet, how and when <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of community is <b>created</b> within <b>a</b> sports context has not been appropriately addressed in literature. Utilizing a community psychology theoretical framework for this study, we employed a qualitative approach to uncover the necessary factors for <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of community within a sports club setting. The results revealed that Common Interest, Leadership Opportunities, Voluntary Activity, and Competition were the most critical components <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of community. The results advance community building theory and suggest practical application for improving the student experience. The implications for sports managers and student affairs administrators are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Environmental {{appropriateness}} {{and ability}} <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>sense</b> of ownership. The mature trees {{around the perimeter}} of the site, and the jambu ayer and nutmeg trees planted by MM Lee in November 1984 and 1989, were also required to be retained and integrated into the landscaped areas.|$|R
25|$|Warring States-era {{architecture}} {{had several}} definitive aspects. City walls, used for defense, were made longer, and indeed several secondary walls were also sometimes built {{to separate the}} different districts. Versatility in federal structures was emphasized, <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of authority and absolute power. Architectural elements such as high towers, pillar gates, terraces, and high buildings amply conveyed this.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of styles {{on the various}} Cluster albums, with significant changes in musical direction from one release to the next, {{makes it difficult to}} categorize Cluster's music. The factors which are present on all 13 albums include the use of electronic instrumentation, loops, and the use of unexpected sounds <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of experimentation.|$|E
25|$|During 19th {{and early}} 20th century, in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, {{liberalism}} influenced periods of reform {{such as the}} Tanzimat and Nahda, {{and the rise of}} secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism. These changes, along with other factors, helped <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of crisis within Islam, which continues to this day. This led to Islamic revivalism.|$|E
5000|$|Millennials use social {{networking}} sites, such as Facebook, <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> different <b>sense</b> of belonging, make acquaintances, and to remain connected with friends.
