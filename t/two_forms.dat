We use the various non-covariant Lagrangian of self-dual <b>two</b> <b>form</b> to perform the analysis and find that the field equation of massive self-dual <b>two</b> <b>form</b> gauge field may be described by ∂^ 2 B^ab+m^ 2 B^ab= 0 or ∂_c (F^cab-F̃^cab) +m^ 2 B^ab= 0. We also find that, depending on the formulation of self-dual <b>two</b> <b>form</b> gauge field, the three rank anti-symmetric field {{may or may not}} be totally eliminated. Thus the different Lagrangian will show different mass generation mechanisms. Comment: Latex 13 page...|$|R

5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes <b>two</b> <b>forms,</b> {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E

5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, some taxonomists {{inspected}} serval {{skins and}} identified two {{species on the}} basis of coat pattern: Felis serval (serval), with large, pronounced spots, and F. servalina or F. ornata (servaline cat), marked by freckle-sized dots. F. servalina was first described in 1839 by Irish naturalist William Ogilby from Sierra Leone; in 1867, British zoologist John Edward Gray described F. herschelii from an Indian skin, which was probably the same as the servaline cat. In 1907, British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock commented that the <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> should be considered independent species, but reverted from this in 1917. Eventually, the <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> came to be recognised as the same species. Another form, F. himalayanus (Himalayan serval), was described from a skin procured from the Himalayan region; however, Scottish naturalist William Jardine noted in The Naturalist's Library (1843) that no such specimen had been identified by him or his colleagues, and that it differed considerably from the common serval. In 1944, Pocock identified three races of the serval from northern Africa.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{an effective}} torsion curvature {{in a second}} order formalism underlying a <b>two</b> <b>form</b> world-volume dynamics in a D_ 5 -brane. In particular, we consider the <b>two</b> <b>form</b> in presence of a background (open string) metric in a U(1) gauge theory. Interestingly the formalism may be viewed via a non-coincident pair of (DD̅) _ 5 -brane with a global NS <b>two</b> <b>form</b> on an anti brane and a local <b>two</b> <b>form</b> on a brane. The energy-momentum tensor is computed in the six dimensional CFT. It is shown to source a metric fluctuation on a vacuum created pair of (DD̅) _ 4 -brane at a cosmological horizon by the <b>two</b> <b>form</b> quanta in the gauge theory. The emergent gravity scenario is shown to describe a low energy (perturbative) string vacuum in 6 D with a (non-perturbative) quantum correction by a lower (p< 5) dimensional D_p brane or an anti brane in the formalism. A closed string exchange between a pair of (DD̅) _ 4 -brane, underlying a closed/open string duality, is argued to describe the Einstein vacuum in a low energy limit. We obtain topological de Sitter and Schwarzschild brane universe in six dimensions. The brane/anti-brane geometries are analyzed to explore some of their characteristic and thermal behaviours in presence of the quantum effects. They reveal an underlying nine dimensional type IIA and IIB superstring theories on S^ 1. Comment: 29 pages, 3 figures, minor revision, typos correcte...|$|R
