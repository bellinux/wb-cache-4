5|$|The 1704 {{campaign}} lasted considerably {{longer than}} usual as the Allies sought <b>to</b> <b>wring</b> out maximum advantage. Realising that France was too powerful {{to be forced to}} make peace by a single victory, however, Eugene, Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves. For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along the valley of the River Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself. Trier was taken on 27 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end.|$|E
5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead <b>to</b> <b>wring</b> out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished. She also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E
25|$|A few in{{transitive}}s {{derive from}} transitive roots through the suffix -ek, {{though this is}} a fossilized suffix {{and is no longer}} productive. For example, dierek (to be found) from diar (to find); dilipek (for a thatch roof to be mended) from dilip (to mend a thatch roof). Sometimes this results in two intransitive derivations of a single transitive root, usually with a semantic nuance: transitive wengid (<b>to</b> <b>wring),</b> intransitive wengiweng (to wring/be wrung), intransitive wengidek (to be twisted); transitive widinge (to deceive), intransitive widing (to deceive/be deceived); intransitive widingek (to be deceitful). The suffix was apparently much more productive earlier in the language's history, even among active verbs.|$|E

25|$|Dereham, Manox, {{and other}} members of the Dowager Duchess's {{household}} were arrested and interrogated by the Council. Her stepson, the Duke of Norfolk, was sent to search her house at Lambeth and question members of the household. They revealed that the Duchess had attempted to destroy evidence by burning the papers of Dereham and his friend William Damport. The Duchess was sent to the Tower. Towards the end of November she was questioned by the Council, but could add little to what was already known by her interrogators. On 1 December Dereham and Culpeper were arraigned on charges of treason. Both were convicted at trial, and sentenced to death. Dereham and his friend William Damport were tortured in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>wring</b> confessions from them concerning Queen Catherine's alleged adultery, and on 10 December 1541 Dereham and Culpeper were executed at Tyburn. On the same day the Dowager Duchess was again questioned, and admitted to having promoted her niece as a prospective bride for the King while having knowledge of her prior misconduct, to having persuaded the Queen to take Dereham into her service, and to having burned Dereham's letters.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after his}} accession, in summer 1304, John and Philip of Savoy were ordered by King Charles II of Naples to attack Epirus, where the Byzantine princess Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, mother and regent of the under-age Despot Thomas I Komnenos Doukas, {{had refused to}} re-affirm Epirote vassalage to Naples and made common cause with the Byzantine Empire. John campaigned in Epirus {{alongside}} a large Achaean contingent, but their siege of the Epirote capital, Arta, failed and the allies withdrew. While Charles II remained determined to repeat the offensive next year, Anna managed to bribe Philip into staying in the Morea. Philip refused to campaign on the pretext of holding a grand parliament at Corinth, where all the barons and vassals of the Principality, including John, were assembled. As a result, Charles II deposed Philip of Savoy and transferred the Principality directly to his own son, Philip of Taranto. The new Prince launched another invasion of Epirus in 1307, which failed due to the {{outbreak of a disease}} among the Latin troops, but managed <b>to</b> <b>wring</b> some territorial concessions from Anna. According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea, John not only participated in this second expedition but actively instigated it, perhaps in hopes of replacing Thomas as ruler of Epirus.|$|E

500|$|In chapter {{twelve of}} Ethics, Rothbard turns his {{attention}} to suspects arrested by the police. He argues that police {{should be able to}} torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard, [...] "Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not <b>to</b> <b>wring</b> a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault". Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect, after having tortured him or her.|$|E

2500|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} size and layout of the West Wing, President Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged Gugler to {{redesign}} it in 1933.

2500|$|Another {{factor was}} {{the efforts of}} the Federal Reserve <b>to</b> <b>wring</b> {{inflation}} out of the economy, marked by Paul Volcker's speech of October 6, 1979, with a series of rises in short-term interest rates. This led to a scenario in which increases in the short-term cost of funding were higher than the return on portfolios of mortgage loans, a large proportion of which may have been fixed-rate mortgages (a problem that is known as an asset-liability mismatch). Interest rates continued to rise, placing even more pressure on S as the 1980s dawned and led to increased focus on high interest-rate transactions. Zvi Bodie, professor of finance and economics at Boston University School of Management, writing in the St. Louis Federal Reserve Review, [...] "asset-liability mismatch was a principal cause of the Savings and Loan Crisis".|$|E

40|$|The Marine Corps trains its {{aviation}} units {{according to}} a Training and Readiness (T&R) Program that quantifies combat readiness based on completion of prescribed sets of training 'events' (e. g., aircraft training flights, tactical control of aircraft, simulator training, etc.). Efficient scheduling of these events is vital <b>to</b> <b>wringing</b> more readiness, i. e., combat power, from shrinking resources. Schedules assign individuals (pilots, naval flight officers, or air controllers) to events and time periods while satisfying T&R Program event sequence, event repetition, and qualification requirements. Secondary to readiness, units pursue equity of opportunity and workload among individuals to preserve morale and produce a wider base of fully combat-qualified warriors. This thesis develops a bicriteria mixed integer programming model that maximizes a combined function of readiness and equity over a time horizon of ninety days. The model enforces T&R Program requirements and personnel availability constraints. A schedule that includes equitability constraints is within 98. 1 % of optimal readiness, but reduces 'inequity' by 79. 9 %. Schedules are typically created in 10 minutes on a personal computer.
