SAS also provides the SAS Fraud Framework. The framework's primary functionality is to monitor transactions across different applications, networks and partners and use analytics to identify anomalies that are indicative of fraud. SAS Enterprise GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) provides risk modeling, scenario analysis and other functions in order to manage and visualize risk, compliance and corporate policies. There is also a SAS Enterprise Risk Management product-set designed primarily for banks and financial services organizations.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change <b>their</b> <b>behaviors.</b> When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E

50|$|The actor-observer {{asymmetry}} {{can seem}} {{similar to the}} hypothesis of a positivity bias in attribution- the claim that people are biased toward favorable evaluations. This hypothesis states that people will attribute <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> with positive consequences to internal factors and <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> with negative consequences to external factors. The positivity bias is {{described in terms of}} the actors attributions of <b>their</b> own <b>behavior.</b> This means that people will attribute <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> which received a positive consequence (passes their driving test and receiving their drivers license) to an internal factor (I really know the material). However, people will attribute <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> in which they received a negative consequence (failing a driving test) to an external factor (the sun was in my eyes).|$|R
50|$|The self-perception {{theory is}} another theory {{in which a}} person infers about {{themselves}} through <b>their</b> <b>behavior.</b> <b>Their</b> <b>behavior</b> can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> better.|$|R
50|$|A {{self-fulfilling prophecy}} {{is a social}} {{positive}} feedback loop between beliefs and behavior: if enough people believe that something is true, <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> can make it true, and observations of <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> may in turn increase belief.

25|$|The {{dimension}} of matter {{refers to the}} set of material objects and <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> through time. In accordance with modern cosmology, matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy singularity at the Big Bang. Space and time were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from subatomic particles to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy) describe the behavior of material objects.|$|E
25|$|Homosexuality is {{the romantic}} or sexual {{attraction}} to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality {{in a variety of}} ways, and may or may not express it in <b>their</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{domestic}} species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for <b>their</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The archaeological and genetic {{data suggest that}} long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to {{other domestic}}ated animals.|$|E

25|$|The {{dimension}} of life refers to organisms and <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> through time. Living objects {{are considered a}} unique subset of material objects. Just as quantum particles form the fundamental units of material complexity, genes are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding {{for the emergence of}} organic complexity.|$|E
25|$|In {{medical and}} {{scientific}} research, asking subjects {{for information about}} <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> is normally strictly scrutinized by institutional review boards, for example, to ensure that adolescents and their parents have informed consent. It {{is not clear whether}} the same rules apply to researchers who collect data from social networking sites. These sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional means. Even though the data are public, republishing it in a research paper might be considered invasion of privacy.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{domestic}} species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for <b>their</b> <b>behaviors.</b> In 2016, a {{study found that}} there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e. selection for tameness), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.|$|E

50|$|Reactivity is {{not limited}} to changes in {{behaviour}} in relation to being merely observed; it can also refer to situations where individuals alter <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> to conform to the expectations of the observer. An experimenter effect occurs when the experimenters subtly communicate their expectations to the participants, who alter <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> to conform to these expectations. The Pygmalion effect occurs when students alter <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> to meet teacher expectations. Both experimenter effects and Pygmalion effects can be caused by bias and stereotyping, as demonstrated by studies involving stereotype threat.|$|R

25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably {{feel they have}} to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> are not rational, but feel compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E
25|$|Slum dwellers usually {{experience}} {{a high rate}} of disease. Diseases that have been reported in slums include cholera, HIV/AIDS, measles, malaria, dengue, typhoid, drug resistant tuberculosis, and other epidemics. Studies focus on children's health in slums address that cholera and diarrhea are especially common among young children. In Haiti (where a majority of the population live in poverty), after the 2010 earthquake, an outbreak of Cholera spread throughout the country, killing 8321 people. Besides children's vulnerability to diseases, many scholars also focus on high HIV/AID prevalence in slums among women. In some slums, gender inequality increases women's risk of HIV/AIDS. Mutual monogamy or using condoms are two main ways to prevent HIV/AIDS, but some women {{might not be able to}} modify <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> due to masculine authority or violence. Furthermore, diseases can sometimes lead to high mortality in slums. According to a study in Nairobi's slums, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis attributed to about 50% of the mortality burden.|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{environmental}} transformation {{continued to increase}} in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting {{in a series of}} new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was environmental determinism, developed by geographer Friedrich Ratzel. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of Franz Boas which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. Julian Steward's cultural ecology is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{androgynous}} people are able to enhance performance cross-situationally because they can alter <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> appropriately to becoming more “masculine” or “feminine” in the given context. According to a study, a person’s activity preference in games and interests are purely based on their gender-typed stereotypes, making the person significantly more stereotyped than androgynous people. In a self-esteem test, when individuals were given opposite-sex activities, gender-typed individuals generally felt more uncomfortable, leading to decreased levels of self-esteem. However, androgynous subjects did not feel discomfort or pessimism about themselves. Therefore, gender typing can often lead to specific gender-rule stereotypes to better facilitate decision making which can adhere to certain benefits as well as limitations. Therefore, parents who foster more non-traditional views in sex role orientation tend to encourage a less discriminatory environment. The child can then freely engage in more choices that are not affected by gender limitations. Androgynous children have been found to have higher self-esteem and higher self-worth.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{domestic}} species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for <b>their</b> <b>behaviors.</b> In 2016, a {{study found that}} there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. There was evidence of selection during dog domestication of genes that affect the adrenaline and noradrenaline biosynthesis pathway. These genes are involved in the synthesis, transport and degradation of a variety of neurotransmitters, particularly the catecholamines, which include dopamine and noradrenaline. Recurrent selection on this pathway and its role in emotional processing and the fight-or-flight response suggests that the behavioral changes we see in dogs compared to wolves may be due to changes in this pathway, leading to tameness and an emotional processing ability. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.|$|E
25|$|People with a {{homosexual}} orientation can express their sexuality {{in a variety}} of ways, and may or may not express it in <b>their</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Many have sexual relationships predominately with people of their own gender identity, though some have sexual relationships with those of the opposite gender, bisexual relationships, or none at all (celibacy). Survey data indicates that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship. Survey data also indicate that between 18% and 28% of gay couples and between 8% and 21% of lesbian couples in the U.S. have lived together ten or more years. Studies have found same-sex and opposite-sex couples to be equivalent to each other in measures of satisfaction and commitment in relationships, that age and gender are more reliable than sexual orientation as a predictor of satisfaction and commitment to a relationship, and that people who are heterosexual or homosexual share comparable expectations and ideals with regard to romantic relationships.|$|E

25|$|It is {{proposed}} {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The dog {{was the first to}} be domesticated, and was established across Eurasia {{before the end of the}} Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals. Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for <b>their</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs – was common.

25|$|All of the {{individuals}} first develop into males and then later {{there is a possibility}} that they become females (protandrous hermaphrodites). This also can be termed as plasticity in sex differentiation. This is shown when there are males, females, and juveniles together in an anemone. In the social groups, the female is the dominant and largest member, with signs of aggression towards other members of the social group. The next rank in the social hierarchy were the fishes that will become males and other fishes that stay as non-reproductive. One experiment placed three juvenile anemonefish in a tank and <b>their</b> <b>behaviors</b> were observed over a month. Observations about social rank were made throughout this period, based on interactions with the group. There was also a noticeable correlation between aggressive behaviors and appeasing behaviors. There were many other signs of dominance in this hierarchy, such as the continuous occupation of territory in the tank by the dominant fish, and increase in body mass of the dominant fish compared to that of lower ranked fish (indicating growth suppression). In addition, a difference in certain steroid levels of the fish indicated that there was reproductive suppression also occurring. The individuals that were ranked lower were reproductively suppressed, which was apparent around the first stage of when the group was formed. Gradually, the sex differentiation and dominance were formed after social interactions occurred for a while. Another experiment performed was if we removed the female from the anemone, then the next dominant male would become the female. There is also a dominance hierarchy that exists here. Females actually utilize aggressive dominance to control the males to prevent the formation of other females, and dominant males prevent juvenile males from mating.|$|E
