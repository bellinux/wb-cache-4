5|$|During the 19th and 20th centuries tourism {{developed}} {{based on}} the rise of antiquarianism, the association with the abbey and mysticism of the town.

5|$|Over the {{remaining}} {{months of the}} year the division carried out patrols of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> road networks, which were being mined. Some of the mines killed men from the division attempting to disarm them, until orders were issued to blow the mines up rather than disarm them. Then on 2December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).|$|E
5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> other landbirds formed {{only a small part of}} the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E

Over the years the design of <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> saddles underwent many modifications and in circa 1865 much of the main line was replaced by L-section steel <b>rails</b> 9 <b>and</b> 12 ft long rolled at the Gorton Works (Gorton Tank) of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company.|$|R

5|$|Despite Beaumont's {{importance}} {{during the}} early boom period, the nearby and already-established commercial center of Houston became the leading city of the period. Houston's status was boosted by the 1914 completion of the Houston Ship Channel, allowing the Port of Houston to service large ships. Refineries and related operations were built along the Houston Ship Channel between Houston and Goose Creek. Heavy industry grew {{in the area and}} gradually created one of the world's largest industrial complexes. By the 1930s, Houston emerged as the state's largest city and the hub of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> road network. The effects of the petroleum-related growth helped offset the effects of the Great Depression substantially, particularly after the discovery of the East Texas field. Texans who became wealthy from the boom established upscale communities including River Oaks, which became a model for community planning in the U.S. Oil-related growth {{led to the creation of}} many new institutions, including the University of Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts, Hermann Park, the Houston Zoo, and the Houston Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 intersects MD 384 (Colesville Road) {{next to the}} {{headquarters}} of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and just south of Silver Spring Station, which serves the Washington Metro's Red Line and the MARC Brunswick Line. The highway parallels CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision and the Red Line southeast to a five-way intersection with US 29 (Georgia Avenue) and 13th Street; there is no direct access from eastbound MD 410 to northbound US 29 or from southbound US 29 to eastbound MD 410. MD 410 continues east on three-lane Burlington Avenuetwo lanes westbound and one lane eastboundto cross <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> metro lines. At Fenton Street, the highway veers southeast onto two-lane Philadelphia Avenue and enters the city of Takoma Park as it passes by the Takoma Park/Silver Spring campus of Montgomery College. MD 410 intersects MD 320 (Piney Branch Road) and has a four-way stop at Holly Avenue next to Takoma Park Elementary School. The highway continues through an intersection with Maple Avenue next to the Takoma Park Library, then follows Philadelphia Avenue to its end at MD 195 (Carroll Avenue) at Takoma Junction. MD 410 runs concurrently with MD 195 for one block, then continues east along Ethan Allen Avenue, which the highway follows through a three-way stop at Jackson Avenue to the eastern city limit of Takoma Park and the MontgomeryPrince George's county line at MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue).|$|E
5|$|The NRRF {{arrived in}} Archangel on 5 June 1919 aboard the SS Porto and SS Stephen and almost {{immediately}} moved up the Dvina River to a camp at Osinova. There they began training for an offensive up <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> river systems of the Dvina. This offensive was designed to push the Bolshevik forces of the Red Army back while the Allies withdrew without interference. A secondary aim was to leave the White Russian forces in a better military position, in the optimistic hope they could subsequently hold their own. Meanwhile, {{with the arrival of}} the NRRF, the survivors of the earlier NREF were subsequently evacuated. Activity during this period also included small-scale patrol and ambush operations around Troitska to the south in an attempt to keep the Bolsheviks off balance, as well as to provide the White Russian forces with the motivation to fight. Both sides had a small air arm, and the British established a makeshift airfield at Bakaritsa, near Archangel. Later in the campaign Sopwiths from France were used from a strip at Obozerskaya. The allies soon established air-superiority, shooting down a number of Bolshevik aircraft. At least one Australian—Ira Jones—is known to have served with the British Royal Air Force in North Russia.|$|E
