25|$|The {{incident}} set off {{an explosion}} of anti-ROTC sentiment as student associations, school administrators and other cause-oriented groups focused on protests and parliamentary approaches to the matter. The Congress of the Philippines took up the legal challenge; generating no less than seventeen bills and resolutions {{in both houses of}} Congress, in response to <b>the</b> <b>clamor.</b> Many of the bills mentioned Mark Chua in the text, acknowledging his death as the catalyst for reform.|$|E
25|$|A {{temporary}} truce between Spain and her rebellious Netherlanders allowed Basque-Spaniard admiral Miguel de Vidazabal, {{commander of}} the Gibraltar squadron, to cooperate with Dutch ships in anti-Corsair operations. These resulted in sixteen Corsair vessels being brought into Gibraltar. The truce prompted by <b>the</b> <b>clamor</b> of public opinion {{and even more so}} by his minister the Count-Duke of Olivares, collapsed in 1621, and a Dutch and Danish fleet of thirty-one sail arrived in the Straits to do what damage it could to Spanish shipping.|$|E

25|$|From January 17 to 20, 2001, {{hundreds}} of thousands of Filipinos gathered at Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), the site of the original People Power Revolution. <b>The</b> <b>clamor</b> for a change in the presidency gained momentum as various sectors of Philippine society – professionals, students, artists, politicians, leftist and rightist groups – joined what became known as EDSA II. Officials of the administration, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and the Philippine National Police (PNP) also withdrew their support for President Estrada.|$|E
25|$|The {{last quarter}} of 2000 {{up to the first}} week of January 2001 was a period of {{political}} and economic uncertainty for the Philippines. On January 16, 2001, the impeachment trial also took a new direction. Private prosecutors walked out of the trial when pro-Estrada senators prevented the opening of an evidence (a brown envelope) containing bank records allegedly owned by President Estrada. With the walkout, the impeachment trial was not completed and Filipinos eventually took to the streets in masses to continue <b>the</b> <b>clamor</b> for President Estrada's resignation.|$|E
500|$|On August 14, 1862, Pitman {{left school}} without his family's {{knowledge}} and volunteered {{to serve in}} the Union Army and fight in the Civil War. He apparently never informed his family in advance about the choice to join the war, because the news of his enlistment was reported back in Hawaiʻi's American missionary community as [...] "Henry Pitman has run away from home and gone [...]" [...] Carter described Pitman's rationale for enlisting: [...] "In the midst of <b>the</b> <b>clamor</b> of war, when the very air vibrated with excitement, the wild enthusiasm of the crowds, and the inspiring sound of the drum, his [...] nature rose within him. His resolve was made." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his record}} of reforms, Democratic party leaders were largely displeased with Blackburn and his administration. They decried his {{record number of}} pardons and resented {{the fact that he}} did not give more {{consideration}} to party service and loyalty when appointing individuals to state jobs. Further, state newspapers noted a lack of eloquence by the governor, and this provided additional fodder for Blackburn's critics. Having announced at the beginning of his term that he would seek no further political office, Blackburn nonetheless attempted to defend his record in a speech at the 1883 Democratic nominating convention, but boos and shouts for him to sit down almost drowned out the address. Finally, Blackburn responded to the heckling by saying he expected to be criticized for his reforms, but that anyone who charged his administration with corruption was a [...] "liar—a base and infamous liar". At this, <b>the</b> <b>clamor</b> from the crowd became deafening, and Blackburn was forced to end his address and take his seat.|$|E
500|$|The film draws {{inspiration}} from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence amongst shoppers. Randy Kornfield wrote the film's original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn {{in order to get}} his son a Power Ranger. While admitting to missing <b>the</b> <b>clamor</b> for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story, released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield's script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox. Columbus was always [...] "attracted to {{the dark side of the}} happiest holiday of the year", so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant [...] "underst the humor in the material" [...] and [...] "was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do". Levant said [...] "The story that was important to me was between the father and son...it's a story about love, and a father's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker. But at its root, the movie's about something really sweet. It's about love and building a better family. I think that's consistent with everything I've done." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} few decades, both residences and {{businesses}} occupied the area, but increasingly business predominated.

The opening of the Erie Canal in the early 19th century meant a huge boom in business for New York City, since {{it was the only}} major eastern seaport which had direct access by inland waterways to ports on the Great Lakes. Wall Street became the [...] "money capital of America".|$|E
2500|$|Republic Act 9163, {{otherwise}} known as the [...] "National Service Training Program (NSTP) Act of 2001", was Congress' answer to <b>the</b> <b>clamor</b> for change in the ROTC program.

Under the NSTP Program, {{both male and female}} college students of any baccalaureate degree course or technical vocational course in public or private educational institutions are obliged to undergo one of three program components, one of which is ROTC, for an academic period of two semesters. However, ROTC as a pre-requisite for graduation was rescinded.|$|E
2500|$|In 1654, Milton {{completed}} the second defence of the English nation Defensio secunda {{in response to}} an anonymous Royalist tract [...] "Regii sanguinis clamor", a work that made many personal attacks on Milton. The second defence praised Oliver Cromwell, now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. Alexander Morus, to whom Milton wrongly attributed <b>the</b> <b>Clamor</b> (in fact by Peter du Moulin), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical Defensio pro se in 1655. In addition to these literary defences of the Commonwealth and his character, Milton continued to translate official correspondence into Latin.|$|E

60|$|Washington's {{first thought}} was that a decisive {{expedition}} conducted by this energetic man of the sword, might retrieve the recent frontier disgrace, {{and put an end to}} the persevering hostility of the Indians.
