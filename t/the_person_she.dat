500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, when {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>she</b> wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls {{her as if she were}} a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E

In June 2009, Bower was asked if there were any plans to explore Donna's bisexuality, to which she replied that there was not. She said [...] "We're getting an enormous amount of leverage with Donna being <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>she</b> is and there's just so much storyline with her and romance with Ringo that I'm not saying it's out of the question, but it's not in any planning stages now".|$|E

500|$|Catherine {{arrived on}} Lopud {{in the second}} half of June 1463. The Ragusan authorities, {{concerned}} that harbouring the Queen might provoke an Ottoman attack on their own state, refused her entry into Dubrovnik itself until 23 July, after her father and brothers launched a successful counter-attack against the Ottomans and pushed them away from the Ragusan borders. Her widowed stepdaughter-in-law, Queen Maria, was also denied access to the Ragusan islands until July. In Dubrovnik, Queen Catherine attempted to claim the tribute of Ston, paid annually to Bosnian rulers, but the authorities declined on 20 August. Moreover, they decided that the annual rent for the use of houses and land belonging to the Bosnian royal family should be kept in their own treasury until the legal heir could be established. On 26 October, Catherine entrusted Ragusa with Thomas's silver sword, stipulating that it should be handed over to Sigismund [...] "should he ever be freed"; or else to nobody but <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>she</b> would name as heir. Soon afterwards she left Dubrovnik for Slano. A reason for Ragusa's reluctance to comply with Catherine's demands may have been the reconquest of parts of Bosnia by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Ragusa's overlord, who attempted to revive the Bosnian kingdom by installing puppet kings.|$|E

Her death, he continued, [...] "quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation" [...] (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she [...] "may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen." [...] Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: [...] "The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order." [...] Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, [...] "have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague." [...] At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: [...] "She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world." ...|$|E
