5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin {{told her he was}} marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E
25|$|A person's {{disqualification}} {{for having}} failed to properly lodge a return of election expenses or having been convicted of an offence may be removed by the President. If <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> done so, the disqualification ceases {{at the end of}} five years from the date when the return was required to be lodged or, as the case may be, the date when the person convicted was released from custody or the date when the fine was imposed. In addition, a person is not disqualified for acquiring or exercising rights of foreign citizenship or declared allegiance to a foreign country if he or she did so before becoming a Singapore citizen.|$|E
25|$|White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs {{said the}} effort to get a team in place {{to respond to the}} health scare has not been {{hindered}} by the lack of a secretary of Health and Human Services or appointees in any of the departmentâ€™s 19 key posts. The president's nominee, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, was still awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate until passing on April 28. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet made appointments to either the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the Surgeon General, or the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current acting Surgeon General, Steven K. Galson, is also currently serving as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Health.|$|E

50|$|The court objected {{that this}} {{disruption}} of its process was unconstitutional as <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> declared martial law (while acknowledging {{that he did}} {{have the power to}} do so), but noted that it was powerless to enforce its prerogatives.|$|R

25|$|Governments and the Cortes {{sit for a}} term {{no longer}} than four years when the {{president}} tenders his resignation to the king and advises the king to dissolve the Cortes, prompting a General Election. It remains within the king's prerogative to dissolve the Cortes if, {{at the conclusion of}} the four years, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Article 56. The president may call for earlier elections, but no sooner than a year after the prior General Election. Additionally, if the Government loses the confidence of the Cortes, then it must resign. In the event that a president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The vice president would take over the day-to-day operations in the meantime, even while vice president himself may be nominated by the king.|$|E
2500|$|The Case for Impeachment {{sets forth}} {{multiple}} arguments why President Trump's actions warrant impeachment from office. The author organizes the book into subsets of different grounds for impeachment. These include complicity or conspiracy with foreign governments. [...] Lichtman explains {{to the reader}} the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution, barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. The author contends impeachment could be brought for actions by the president intended to benefit himself financially based on inside information about economic dealings. Lichtman observes <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> garnered knowledge from a study of earlier key events in U.S. politics: [...] "A president {{who seems to have}} learned nothing from history is abusing and violating the public trust and setting the stage for a myriad of impeachable offenses." ...|$|E
50|$|The leak to Newsweek, presumably from TIME magazine, was {{the first}} major leak of investigative information. More {{attenuated}} leaks have followed, seemingly tailored to either include or absolve various officials and media personages. White House officials such as Press Secretary Scott McClellan and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> made any on-the-record comments concerning the investigation since Newsweeks e-mail scoop, although other Republican officials, particularly RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman, are talking with the press.|$|R

50|$|In January 2010 Maung Oo said in {{a speech}} that pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi could be {{released}} in November of that year on the expiry of her current period of house arrest.Speaking in parliament in March 2011 Maung Oo said that this was not the time to discuss amnesty for political prisoners.He pointed out that under the 2008 constitution an amnesty could only be granted by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> on <b>the</b> advice of the National Defense and Security Council (NDSC). <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet taken office and the NDSC <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet been formed.|$|R
5000|$|The Kyrgyzstani {{government}} also has {{felt compelled to}} request Russia's economic protection. The harsh reality of Kyrgyzstan's economic situation means that the nation is an inevitable international client state, {{at least for the}} foreseeable future. Despite concerted efforts to seek international [...] "sponsors," [...] Akayev <b>has</b> <b>not</b> received much more than a great deal of international good will. Even if <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> lived seventeen years in Russia himself and even if his advisers, family, and friends were not all Soviet-era intellectuals {{with a high degree of}} familiarity with Russia, economic necessity probably would push Kyrgyzstan further toward Russia.|$|R

50|$|The Constitution {{provides}} for binding referendums (plebiscito) {{only in the}} case a constitutional reform passed by Congress is completely vetoed by the President and then confirmed by Congress by a two-thirds majority of each chamber.

5000|$|Since 1953 {{whenever}} the President is {{on board a}} military flight its call sign {{is the name of}} the armed service followed by the word [...] "One".

50|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, {{joined by}} Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan. Breyer {{held that a}} stay would be appropriate. Breyer drew a {{distinction}} between MedellÃ­n v. Texas and Leal's case, noting that the Court had refused to grant a stay of execution in MedellÃ­n in significant part because <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> told <b>the</b> Court there would be likely congressional action. Breyer pointed out that in Leal's case congressional action was a reasonable possibility. Further, Breyer argued that under Federal Trade Commission v. Dean Foods Co., the Court could take action to preserve its future jurisdiction that would result upon Congress passing the Avena legislation.|$|R

50|$|Fifty {{four members}} of Congress, {{including}} U.S. Representative Ron Dellums, sued George H.W. Bush in 1990 attempting to halt a preemptive military buildup in the Middle East in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The plaintiff members of Congress asserted that military action without {{a declaration of war}} would be unlawful under U.S. Const. art. I, Â§ 8, cl. 11 of the United States Constitution. The District Court held that, although the plaintiff's claims were plausible, because <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet initiated war-like actions and only 54 members of Congress (53 members of the House and one member of the Senate) were involved in the suit, and not a majority, the dispute was not ripe for adjudication at that time. Accordingly the motion for preliminary injunction was denied.|$|R
5000|$|According to Article One of the United States Constitution, a {{bill that}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> signed and not vetoed becomes law ten days after {{being sent to the}} President (not {{including}} Sundays). There is one exception to this: [...] "unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law." [...] The action of the President allowing a bill to expire without signing it after the adjournment of Congress is known as a pocket veto. The pocket veto had been used by United States presidents starting with James Madison.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{political}} and constitutional law experts questioned whether Obama was officially <b>the</b> <b>president</b> since he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> correctly performed the constitutional {{duty of the}} Oath.

50|$|On 20 February <b>the</b> <b>President</b> Shimon Peres {{announced}} that Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu {{would be given}} the task of forming a government. This {{is the first time}} in which <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> appointed <b>the</b> head of the largest party for this task, although there had already been several cases in which the Prime Minister was not the head of the largest party. Such a case occurred in the 1996 elections, when Netanyahu himself was elected Prime Minister by direct vote although his Likud party won fewer seats than Shimon Peres's Labor party. Peres's motivation in nominating Netanyahu was likely based upon the judgment that Netanyahu was in a better position numerically to put together a coalition. Likud's potential partners on the political right won more seats than the parties of the centre-left, who would more likely support Kadima.|$|R

50|$|Despite the commission's findings, {{political}} opposition still prevented Porter from obtaining reinstatement.

And when Hayes left office, he was succeeded by James A. Garfield, who had voted to convict Porter {{as part of the}} court. When, on May 6, 1882, President Chester A. Arthur - who succeeded Garfield after his assassination - commuted Porter's sentence to restore his rights of citizenship and to hold public office, it was seen by The New York Times as a collapse to pressure from powerful interests, and special note was made that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> agreed or disagreed with the Schofield Commission in his order.|$|R
