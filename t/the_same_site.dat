5|$|In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas visited <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> as Lehmann {{and found}} a red lead mineral that had useful {{properties}} as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A bright yellow pigment made from crocoite also became popular.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, the New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer. That year, the {{railroad}} constructed a freight depot and steamboat wharf (likely {{also used for}} passenger trains) along Water Street.

5|$|A Mora stone slab {{found at}} the Mathura-Vrindavan archaeological site in Uttar Pradesh, held now in the Mathura Museum, has a Brahmi inscription. It is dated to the 1stcenturyCE and lists five Vrishni heroes: Balarama, Krishna, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and Samba.

5|$|Domitian {{returned}} to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time {{under the command}} of Tettius Julianus, and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> where Fuscus had previously perished. An attack on the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{originally}} {{played on}} an open pitch in the south-east corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> where Liverpool F.C. planned a stadium, however abandoned the project. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs. Cruit asked the club to leave his land after two years because the crowds became far too large and noisy.|$|E
5|$|From 1997 to 2009 {{the main}} {{collection}} was housed in this single new {{building and the}} collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library {{announced that it would}} be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site.</b> From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service. Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013. The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) and the Library's Document Supply Collection is based on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> in Boston Spa. Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds. The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich, south-east London, which is no longer in use.|$|E
50|$|Because they forage at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites,</b> B. hortorum compete largely with honeybees. To {{resolve the}} issue and {{maximize}} their consumption during foraging, bumblebees forage {{early in the morning}} and evening while honeybees forage during the afternoon.|$|R
50|$|In a 25 October 1944 air raid, {{the camp}} was largely {{destroyed}} at the reported loss of 150 prisoners' lives. The survivors were transported to the Fuhlsb√ºttel subcamp, but they continued to work at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites</b> as before.|$|R

5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> {{from year to year}} is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago and North Western Railway's Kinzie Street {{railroad}} bridge (also {{known as}} the Carroll Avenue bridge) is a single leaf bascule bridge across the north branch of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, Illinois. At {{the time of its}} opening in 1908 it was the world's longest and heaviest bascule bridge. Previous bridges on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> included the first bridge to cross the Chicago River, Chicago's first railroad bridge, {{and one of the first}} all-steel bridges in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Nova Scotia Government had {{originally}} proposed minor repairs for the structure, but {{they decided that}} a new bridge would be more cost-effective. Unlike the old bridge, the new bridge was designed without overhead steel arches that would have doubled the cost. It was built on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> as the old bridge's predecessor, which was constructed in 1907.|$|E
50|$|The {{other type}} of philopatry {{exhibited}} is site fidelity, where pairs of birds return to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> nesting <b>site</b> {{for a number of}} years. Among the most extreme examples known of this tendency was the fidelity of a ringed northern fulmar that returned to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> nest <b>site</b> for 25 years. The average number of birds returning to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> nest <b>sites</b> is high in all species studied, with around 91 percent for Bulwer's petrels, and 85 percent of males and 76 percent of females for Cory's shearwaters (after a successful breeding attempt).|$|R
50|$|All {{three species}} may occupy <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites</b> year after year, {{creating}} {{large numbers of}} nests. Mud dauber nests can last many years in protected locations and are often used as nest sites by other kinds of wasps and bees, {{as well as other}} types of insects.|$|R
50|$|Individuals {{may have}} a large range, occupying hollow logs in cooler months and {{wandering}} across areas up to 20 ha. Males {{tend to have a}} larger range. They appear to return to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites,</b> even after long absences, which may contribute to a threat of extinction.|$|R
5|$|The {{administration}} of Governor James D. Williams proposed {{the construction of}} the fourth state capitol building in 1878. The third state capitol building was razed and the new one was constructed on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site.</b> Two million dollars was appropriated for construction and the new building was completed in 1888. The building was still in use in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The current castle, {{built in}} stone {{during the reign}} of King Henry II, is on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. A keep used to stand on the motte which is on the south west of the site, {{although}} most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period. In the 17th century the motte was landscaped {{with the addition of a}} path. The bailey was incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church was}} set up by St Paulinus of York {{on the site of the}} present All Saints Parish Church {{sometime}} in the early 7th century. It was made from wood and nothing survives of it. In 855 a stone church was built on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site,</b> fragments of stone have been found during restoration work which provide strong evidence of this Saxon church.|$|E

50|$|It breeds across Europe {{and western}} and central Asia and is migratory.

5|$|The medieval {{church of}} St John was {{demolished}} in 1824 and rebuilt on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site,</b> though a stump {{of the medieval}} preaching cross survives by the exterior south wall. The former rectory is a 17th-century structure with later additions. Though it remains adjacent to the church, {{it has not been}} a parsonage house {{since the end of the}} 19th century. Today it is known as Glebe House and is divided into flats.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{botanical garden}} in South Africa is the Durban Botanic Gardens {{which has been}} located on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> since 1851.

Stellenbosch University Botanical Garden is the oldest university botanical garden in South Africa, and was established in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} reopened by the Great Western Railway in 1926, now called Long Ashton Platform; Ashton by then {{was the name}} of a station on the Teign Valley Line in Devon. Again, the exact date of opening is disputed: most sources state 12 July 1926, but some say 20 September the same year. It was located on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>site</b> as the first station.|$|E
30|$|From {{the human}} health survey, we {{generated}} a representative subset of 60 of the households retaining variation in ethnicity, socioeconomic status and geographic location. Our {{intent was to}} evaluate whether diarrhoea was also a health problem for calves and a potential pathogen transmission risk to livestock-keeping households. In practice, we could confirm that 44 of these households were available for follow-up with 16 additional pastoralist households included in the calf-focused study at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites</b> as <b>the</b> targeted households but without confirmation of {{their participation in the}} human health survey. Pastoralist communities are very dynamic, with frequent household movement and turnover. We chose to sample these unconfirmed households at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites</b> for zoonotic pathogens in their calves to maintain a rigorous sample size for prevalence estimates for the long-term study.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, {{when the}} Roman Empire {{took control of}} Celtic lands, earlier Iron Age sacred sites were reused, with Roman temples being built on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites.</b> Examples include Uley in Gloucestershire, Worth in Kent, Hayling Island in Hampshire, Vendeuil-Caply in Oise, Saint-Germain-le-Rocheux in Chatillon-sur-Seine and Schleidweiler in Trier.|$|R
50|$|This form of {{a church}} can also be {{recognized}} from the holes which remain from earlier earth-bound post churches built on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sites.</b> Little is known about what these older churches actually looked like or how they were constructed, as they were all destroyed or replaced many centuries ago.|$|R
