All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter.

Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on. On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think I may say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E

Maura Johnston, a writer for MTV, wrote more positively about the song, commenting favorably on the contemporary artists' performances in living up to their predecessors. [...] "Despite the different faces, the overall feel {{is similar to the}} original's," [...] Johnston wrote. Simon Vozick-Levinson, a writer for Entertainment Weekly, gave the song a mixed review, noting <b>that</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> World 25 for Haiti was not as good as the original: [...] "All in all, I can’t say this new 'We Are the World' measured up to the 1985 version." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon afterwards, {{the patrol}} found {{the king and}} Wilson sent a message back to the laager {{requesting}} reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, {{under the command of}} Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl [...] "Pete" [...] Ingram (a Montana cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, [...] "I think I may say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sole survivors of that party." [...] Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.|$|E
