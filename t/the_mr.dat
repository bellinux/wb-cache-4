5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, relations between <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street {{station and the}} congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. <b>The</b> <b>MR</b> management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with <b>the</b> <b>MR.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following Watkin's {{retirement}} {{relations between}} the GCR and <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed <b>the</b> <b>MR.</b> In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated {{as a part of the}} GCR. A substantial part of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging the profitability of <b>the</b> <b>MR.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1903 the Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} {{were replaced}} by Metropolitan Railway D Class 2-4-0 tank engines, numbered 71 and 72. The D Class locomotives were unsatisfactory to <b>the</b> <b>MR,</b> and between 1916 and 1922 <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> sold their entire stock of D Class engines. Their place on the O was taken by two Metropolitan Railway A Class 4-4-0T locomotives numbered 23 and 41, built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1866 and 1869 respectively. The A Class locomotives would alternate in service, each operating the route for a week.

Two cattle wagons were added to the line's stock in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the A refusing to cooperate, a tentative agreement was reached with the London and North Western Railway, with whom Watkin was on good terms, for <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> to build a route via Chesham to connect to LNWR mainline. This scheme would provide the LNWR with an alternative route into London when necessary, while providing Watkin with his long-sought connection to the north. The land required for an intermediate station near Chalfont St Giles and a line between there and a site outside Chesham was purchased. Agreement was reached with the LNWR {{that the costs of}} building the line would be shared equally by <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> and LNWR in return for the LNWR having running rights to Rickmansworth, and an Act of Parliament authorising the extension was obtained in 1885.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>MR</b> grew steadily, {{extending}} its {{own services}} and acquiring other local railways {{north and west}} of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin negotiated {{to take control of}} the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> north from London to Aylesbury and extend the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London were poor, and although still roundabout, the scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did receive consent in 1881 to extend <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> to Aylesbury.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>MR</b> {{management}} were {{horrified at}} the potential {{loss of income}} and restarted negotiations with the GCR, and a 1906 agreement meant that GCR traffic was shared between {{the old and new}} routes. Management of the shared route north of Harrow alternated every five years between <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> and GCR. (A proposed link between Marylebone and the sub-surface section of the Metropolitan Railway, which would have allowed GCR trains to run across London via the MR-controlled Thames Tunnel and on to the south coast, was abandoned.) The sharing arrangement meant through trains running from Chesham to Marylebone, as well as <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> terminus at Baker Street, and that the branch was worked by GCR trains as well as the ageing MR rolling stock.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Railway {{was unhappy}} with the {{performance}} and safety of the D Class locomotives and sold them between 1916 and 1922. With much of their route close to London now electrified <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> had surplus steam locomotives, and two Metropolitan Railway A Class locomotives, numbers 23 (built 1866) and 41 (built 1869), were transferred to the route. Built by Beyer, Peacock and Company from 1864, the A Class {{had been the first}} locomotives owned by the Metropolitan (in 1863, the first year of operation, <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> had used engines loaned from the GWR). Although the most advanced locomotives regularly to work the route, the A Class predated all other rolling stock on the Tramway. The two locomotives operated for a week at a time.

5|$|The {{station was}} opened as Brompton (Gloucester Road) on 1 October 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) {{when it opened}} an {{extension}} from Paddington (Praed Street) (now Paddington).

The station was provided with four platforms sheltered by an elliptical glazed iron roof.

Initially, <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> operated all services over both companies' tracks.|$|E
5|$|Watkin {{continued}} to harbour ambitions of linking his railway {{companies in the}} north and south of England, and while the construction of the Rickmansworth extension was underway planned two possible routes north from Rickmansworth across the Chilterns. One proposal envisaged <b>the</b> <b>MR</b> taking over or reaching agreement with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, building a link between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury, and running over the A's line to the north. The A had close relations with the Great Western Railway, with whom they shared a station at Aylesbury.
