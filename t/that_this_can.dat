5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E

25|$|A single {{curve is}} regular {{homotopic}} {{to a standard}} circle (any knot can be unknotted if the curve is allowed to pass through itself).

25|$|While diseconomies {{of scale}} are {{typically}} associated with large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Mclean has observed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> occur once the workforce exceeds around 20 employees. At this point business complexity grows more rapidly than revenue. The business experiences falling productivity, leading to rising variable costs along with rapidly rising overheads.|$|E
25|$|Underwriting {{much of the}} Jesus Fellowship’s {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} is a theology of the new creation.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods. However, statistical analysis shows <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence (such as fungal spikes) provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.|$|E
25|$|MDMA {{is known}} to be metabolized by two main {{metabolic}} pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The metabolism may be primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and COMT. Complex, nonlinear pharmacokinetics arise via autoinhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, resulting in zeroth order kinetics at higher doses. It is thought <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> result in sustained and higher concentrations of MDMA if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{first model}} of strong {{reciprocity}} was proposed by Herbert Gintis in 2000, which contained {{a number of}} simplifying assumptions addressed in later models. In 2004, Samuel Bowles and Gintis presented a follow up model in which they incorporated cognitive, linguistic, and other capacities unique to humans in order to demonstrate how these might be harnessed to strengthen the power of social norms in large scale public goods games. In a 2001 model, Joe Henrich and Robert Boyd also build on Gintis' model by incorporating conformist transmission of cultural information, demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> also stabilize cooperative groups norms.|$|E
