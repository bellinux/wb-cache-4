6000|$|... "Yesterday I had a {{talk with}} this man Jones, who is staying in Market Blandings. Why is he staying in Market Blandings?

Helen, it was you who told me these notes were in Rose's desk. Have you any {{knowledge}} of more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honestly," [...] he admitted, [...] "I can't give an opinion. I thought I {{understood}} {{something of}} human nature before I came into <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and those few members of your aristocracy whom I have met through you. But frankly, to use a homely metaphor, you take {{the wind out of}} my sails. I don't know where I am when you lay down the law. There is something wrong between us fundamentally. I was brought up the same way Vont was brought up. Things were right or wrong, moral or immoral. You people seem to have made laws of your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{altogether}} necessary, I dare say," [...] Lord Ashleigh admitted. [...] "On {{the other}} hand, I feel {{sure that you}} will find him a comfort, {{and it would be}} rather a relief to me to know that there is some one in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> all the time in whom I place absolute confidence. I dare say I shall be very glad to see him back again {{at the end of the}} year, but that is neither here nor there.

6000|$|... "La, my good fellow," [...] said Blakeney gaily, [...] "you may safely trust Tony to {{go where}} I send him. Do you but do as I tell you, and leave him to look after himself. And now," [...] he added, {{speaking}} more earnestly, [...] "the sooner {{you get out of}} Paris the better it will be for us all. As you see, I am only sending you to La Villette, because it is not so far, but that I can keep in personal <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Remain close to the gates for an hour after nightfall.

60|$|November 19th. I find with horror, dearest Alice, that I have {{inadvertently}} {{left this}} all {{these days in}} my portfolio (interrupted where I broke off above,) {{under the impression that}} I had finished and posted it. This is dreadful, and I am afraid shows how the beneficent London, for all its beneficence, does interpose, invade and distract, giving one too many things to do and to bear in mind at once. What sickened me is that I have thus kept my letter over a whole wasted week--so far as being in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> all is concerned. On the other hand this lapse of time enables me blessedly to confirm, in the light of further experience, whatever of good and hopeful the beginning of the present states to you....|$|E
6000|$|I don't know if {{this letter}} will reach you, but have been [...] reading pieces in Saserkopee & N. Y. papers about your goings-on [...] and hear you are at a town called Lipsittsville, oh how could [...] you run away from the {{beautiful}} home Harris & I gave you, I am [...] sure {{if there was anything}} we didn't do for y'r comfort & [...] happiness you had only to ask & here you go and make us a [...] laughing stock in Saserkopee, we had told everyone you would be [...] at our party & suddenly you up & disappear & it has taken us [...] months to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> such a wicked, untruthful lie [...] about friend sick in Boston & all.

60|$|When {{you have}} seen the Place of St. Mark by night your eye has tasted its most {{delicate}} delight, but then it is the delight given by a memory only, and it <b>touches</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> sadness. <b>You</b> must see the Piazza to-day,--every window fluttering with rich stuffs and vivid colors; the three great flag staffs [Footnote: Once bearing the standards of Cyprus, Candia, and Venice.] hanging their heavy flags; the brilliant square alive with a holiday population, with resplendent uniforms, with Italian gesture and movement, and that long glittering procession, bearing slowly on the august paraphernalia of the Church--you must see all this before you can enter into the old heart of Venetian magnificence, and feel its life about you.|$|R
6000|$|I {{notice in}} the Daily Mail of this morning that you are enquiring through the [...] "personal" [...] column for the {{whereabouts}} of Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald. That gentleman has been a client of mine, and I have been in occasional communication <b>with</b> him. If <b>you</b> will inform me {{of the nature of}} your business, I may, perhaps, be able to put <b>you</b> in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Fitzgerald. <b>You</b> will understand, however, that, under the circumstances, I shall require proofs of your good faith.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} a prey to agitations and complications, many assaults, invasions and inconveniences, since leaving town--whereby I have had to put off thanking you for two {{brilliant}} letters. And yet I have wanted to write--to tell you (explaining) how I found myself swallowed up by one social abyss after another, and tangled in a succession of artful feminine webs, at Stafford House that evening, so that I couldn't get into <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> or with Ethel, again, before you were gone, as I found when I finally made a dash for you. That too was very complicated, and evening-parties bristle with dangers.... The very critical business of the final luminous copy is, how ever, coming to an end--I mean the arriving at the utterly last intense reductions and compressions. So much has to come out, however, that I am sickened and appalled--and this sacrifice of the very life-blood of one's play, the mere vulgar anatomy and bare-bones poverty to which one has to squeeze it more and more, is the nauseating side of the whole desperate job. In spite of which I am interesting myself deeply in the three act comedy I have undertaken for Frohman--and which I find ferociously difficult--but with a difficulty that, thank God, draws me on and fascinates. If I can go on believing in my subject I can go on treating it; but sometimes I have a mortal chill and wonder if I ain't damnably deluded. However, the balance inclines to faith and I think it works out. You shall hear what comes of it--even at the worst. Meanwhile for yourself, dearest Lucy, buck up and patiently woo the Muse. She responds at last always to true and faithful wooing--to the right artful patience--and turns upon one the smile from which light breaks. I have been reading over the Long Duel (which I immediately return)--with a sense of its having great charm and care of execution, and quality and grace, but also, dear Lucy, of its drawbacks for practical prosperity. The greatest of these {{seems to me to}} be fundamental--to reside in the fact that the subject isn't dramatic, that it deals with a state, a position, a situation (of the [...] "static" [...] kind), and not, save in a very minor degree, with an action, a progression; which fact, highly favourable to it for a tale, a psychologic picture, is detrimental to its tenseness--to its being matter for a play and developed into 4 acts. A play appears to me of necessity to involve a struggle, a question (of whether, and how, will it or won't it happen? and if so, or not so, how and why?--which we have the suspense, the curiosity, the anxiety, the tension, in a word, of seeing; and which means that the whole thing shows an attack upon oppositions--with the victory or the failure on one side or the other, and each wavering and shifting, from point to point.) But your hero is thus not an agent, he is passive, he doesn't take the field. I say all this because I think there is light on the matter of the history of the fate of the play in it--and also think that there are other elements of disadvantage for the piece too. The elderly (or almost?) French artist with a virtuous love-sorrow doesn't, for the B.P., belong to the actual; he's romantic, and old-fashionedly romantic, and remote; and the case is aggravated by the corresponding maturity of the heroine. You will say that there is the young couple, and what comes of their being there, and their [...] "action"; but the truth about that, I fear, is that innocent young lovers as such, and not as being engaged in other difficulties and with other oppositions (of their own,) have practically ceased to be a dramatic value--aren't any longer an element or an interest to conjure with. Don't hate me for saying these things--for working them out critically, and so far as may be, illuminatingly, in face of the difficulty the L.D. seems to have had in getting itself brought out. We are dealing with an art prodigiously difficult and arduous every way--and in which one seems most of all to sink into a Sea of colossal Waste. I'm not sure that The Other House, after all my not-to-be-reckoned labour and calculation on it, isn't (to be) wasted. But these are dreary words--it is much past midnight. I am damned critical--for it's the only thing to be, and all else is damned humbug. But I don't mean a douche of cold water, and am ever so tenderly and faithfully yours, ...|$|E
