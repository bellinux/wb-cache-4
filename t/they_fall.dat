Five years earlier, Raj and Sonia (then a model) {{meet at a}} beach in Cape Town. <b>They</b> <b>fall</b> in love and move in together; Sonia becomes pregnant with Raj's child, which makes him happy, but Sonia refuses Raj's marriage proposal and says {{she is going to}} terminate the pregnancy as her child would {{stand in the way of}} wealth, fame, power and status and their relationship ends.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. <b>They</b> <b>fall</b> into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials {{can also be used}} as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E

5|$|Conservation {{measures}} have included attempts to breed them in captivity {{and to reduce}} fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites. Nearly 15% of the chicks are killed when <b>they</b> <b>fall</b> off the nests and die of starvation, so some conservationists have used nets positioned below the nests to prevent injuries to falling young and then raising these fallen birds in enclosures for about five months before releasing them to join their wild siblings.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{version of}} Puyo Puyo and replaces its {{characters}} {{with those from}} the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, being primarily based on the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated series. The gameplay is reminiscent of Tetris, in which the player must organise different coloured shapes as <b>they</b> <b>fall</b> down a board. The game received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, while criticising the difficulty and overuse of the falling block puzzle genre.|$|E

Despite Zeron's defeat, Elena is still cursed, and decides to end Experiment Zero. Aeron chooses to join her, and the two throw themselves into the Scar, using the chain to close it as <b>they</b> <b>fall.</b> The epilogue reveals that the land continued to be plagued by war, and that the Vestra passed down Aeron and Elena's tale as a legend.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{principle}} of the participles may be illustrated with the verb fali (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character <b>falls,</b> <b>they</b> are falonta (about to <b>fall).</b> As <b>they</b> drop, <b>they</b> are falanta (<b>falling).</b> After <b>they</b> hit the ground, <b>they</b> are falinta (<b>fallen).</b>|$|R

He even had Shirakawa imprisoned; at this point <b>they</b> <b>fallen</b> out of their political alliance.|$|R
5|$|In a flame test, {{sodium and}} its {{compounds}} glow yellow because the excited 3s electrons of sodium emit a photon when <b>they</b> <b>fall</b> from 3p to 3s; the wavelength of this photon corresponds to the D line at about 589.3nm. Spin-orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two, at 589.0 and 589.6nm; hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines.|$|E

5|$|Many {{migrant workers}} have little education, little {{knowledge}} {{of the law and}} their rights, and leave home to support their families. <b>They</b> <b>fall</b> victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at home and in their host countries.

5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as <b>they</b> <b>fall</b> outside the halogens and noble gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) differ from the organogens: none are universally required for life; arsenic is notoriously poisonous; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E
5|$|The film follows Kaspar Jørgensen, a Danish poet in the 1940s who {{is seeking}} inspiration. At the {{suggestion}} of his psychiatrist, Dr. Mørk, he travels to Norway to meet the famous author Sigrid Undset.

She promises not to cut her hair until they are reunited, and Kaspar returns to Denmark.|$|E
25|$|The {{odds against}} there being no Set in 12 cards when {{playing a game}} of Set start off at 30:1 for the first round. Then <b>they</b> quickly <b>fall,</b> and after about the 4th round they are 14:1 {{and for the next}} 20 rounds <b>they</b> slowly <b>fall</b> towards 13:1. So for most of the rounds played, the odds are between 14:1 and 13:1.|$|R

5|$|The station, its {{surrounding}} {{streets and the}} railway approach feature prominently in the 1955 Ealing comedy film The Ladykillers.

5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as <b>they</b> <b>fall</b> from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{uniformity}} {{through different}} LARP games, {{although they may}} have similar styles, no one LARP will follow the exact same rules and regulations.

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as <b>they</b> <b>fall</b> and become rain.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when <b>they</b> <b>fall.</b> After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E
