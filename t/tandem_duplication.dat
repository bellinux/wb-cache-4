These studies have mostly focused on single nucleotide poly-morphisms, small insertions or deletions and on copy number variants. Other structural vari-ants, such as large insertions or deletions, <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications,</b> translocations, and inversions are less well-studied, despite that some have an important impact on pheno-types. In the present study, we performed a large-scale survey of structural variants in cat-tle. We report the identification of 6, 426 putative structural variants in cattle extracted from whole-genome sequence data of 62 bulls representing the three major French dairy breeds. These genomic variants affect DNA segments greater than 50 base pairs and correspond to deletions, inversions and <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications.</b> Out of these, we identified a total of 547 deletions and 410 <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> which could potentially code for CNVs.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} constructions that correct duplications of {{multiple}} consecutive symbols. These errors {{are known as}} <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications,</b> where a sequence of symbols is repeated; respectively as palindromic duplications, where a sequence is repeated in reversed order. We compare the redundancies of these constructions with code size upper bounds that are obtained from sphere packing arguments. Proving that an upper bound on the code cardinality for tandem deletions is also an upper bound for inserting <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications,</b> we derive the bounds based on this special tandem deletion error as this results in tighter bounds. Our upper bounds on the cardinality directly imply lower bounds on the redundancy which we compare with the redundancy {{of the best known}} construction correcting arbitrary burst insertions. Our results indicate that the correction of palindromic duplications requires more redundancy than the correction of <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> and both significantly less than arbitrary burst insertions.

40|$|<b>Tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> are an {{essential}} source of genetic novelty, and their variation in natu-ral populations {{is expected to}} influence adaptive walks. Here, we describe evolutionary impacts of recently-derived, segregating <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> in Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila simulans. We observe an excess of duplicated genes involved in defense against pathogens, insecticide resistance, chorion development, cuticular peptides, and lipases or endopeptidases associated with the accessory glands across both species. The observed agreement is greater than expectations on chance alone, suggesting large amounts of convergence across functional categories. We document evidence of wide-spread selection on the D. simulans X, suggesting adaptation through duplication is com-mon on the X. Despite the evidence for positive selection, duplicates display an excess of low frequency variants consistent with largely detrimental impacts, limiting the variation that can effectively facilitate adaptation. Standing variation for <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> spans less than 25 % of the genome in D. yakuba and D. simulans, indicating that evolution will be strictly limited by mutation, even in organisms with large population sizes.

40|$|Protein domain repeats {{are common}} in {{proteins}} that {{are central to the}} organization of a cell, in particular in eukaryotes. They are known to evolve through internal <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications.</b> However, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is incomplete. To shed light on repeat expansion mechanisms, we have studied the evolution of the muscle protein Nebulin, a protein that contains a large number of actin-binding nebulin domains. Nebulin proteins have evolved from an invertebrate precursor containing two nebulin domains. Repeat regions have expanded through duplications of single domains, as well as duplications of a super repeat (SR) consisting of seven nebulins. We show that the SR has evolved independently into large regions in at least three instances: twice in the invertebrate Branchiostoma floridae and once in vertebrates. In-depth analysis reveals several recent <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> in the Nebulin gene. The events involve both single-domain and multidomain SR units or several SR units. There are single events, but frequently the same unit is duplicated multiple times. For instance, an ancestor of human and chimpanzee underwent two <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications.</b> The duplication junction coincides with an Alu transposon, thus suggesting duplication through Alu-mediated homologous recombination. Duplications in the SR region consistently involve multiples of seven domains. However, the exact unit that is duplicated varies both between species and within species. Thus, multiple <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> of the same motif did not create the large Nebulin protein. Finally, analysis of segmental duplications in the human genome reveals that duplications are more common in genes containing domain repeats than in those coding for nonrepeated proteins. In fact, segmental duplications are found three to six times more often in long repeated genes than expected by chance.   authorCount : 4 </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{to detect and}} measure the frequency of spontaneous <b>tandem</b> genetic <b>duplications</b> located throughout the Salmonella genome. The method {{is based on the}} ability of duplication-containing strains to inherit two selectable alleles of a single gene during generalized transductional crosses. One allele of the gene carries an insertion of the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn 10; the other allele is a wild-type copy of that gene. Using this technique, we have measured the frequency of <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> at 38 chromosomal sites and the amount of material included in 199 independent duplications. These results suggest that, in one region of the chromosome, <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> are particularly frequent events. Such duplications have end points within rRNA (rrn) cistrons and probably arise by unequal cross-over between these dispersed repeated sequences.

40|$|During the {{development}} of disomic additions of rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosomes to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), two reverse <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> on wheat chromosomes 3 D and 4 A were isolated. By virtue of their meiotic pairing, the reverse <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> initiated the chromatid type of the breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle. This BFB cycle continued through pollen mitoses {{and in the early}} endosperm divisions, but no clear evidence of its presence in embryo mitoses was found. The chromosome type of BFB cycle was initiated by fusion of two broken chromosome ends resulting in a dicentric or a ring chromosome. Chromosome type BFB cycles were detected in embryo mitoses and in root tips, but they did not persist until the next meiosis and were not transmitted to the progeny. Active BFB cycles induced breakage of other wheat chromosomes that resulted in additional reverse <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> and dicentric and ring chromosomes. Four loci, on chromosome arms 2 BS, 3 DS, 4 AL, and most likely on 7 DL, were particularly susceptible to breakage. The BFB cycles produced high frequency of variegation for pigmentation of the aleurone layer of kernels and somatic chimeras for a morphological marker. With the exception of low mutation rate, the observed phenomena are consistent with the activity of a Ds-like element.

In this paper, we show that the alignment problem extended to non-overlapping moves can be solved in O(n 5) for general scoring schemes, O(n 4 logn) for concave scoring schemes and O(n 4) for re-stricted scoring schemes. Furthermore, we show that the alignment problem extended to non-overlapping moves, inversions and <b>tandem</b> <b>duplications</b> can be solved with the same time complexities.

In addition to cross-linking actin filaments into bundles and networks, CH domains also bind intermediate filaments and some signal transduction proteins to the actin cytoskeleton.
