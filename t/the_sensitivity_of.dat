Along each path, the forward and adjoint implementations produce the same values, but the adjoint method rearranges the calculations to generate potential computational savings. The adjoint method outperforms a forward implementation in calculating <b>the</b> <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> a small number of outputs to a large number of inputs.
