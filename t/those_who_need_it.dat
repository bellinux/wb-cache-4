5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others, to give advice to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give correction to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> and pray for the living and the dead.

Matt Smith of Digital Trends said the mouse was comfortable and the buttons felt robust. He noted that the button arrangement may [...] "take some time to get used to". Rob Keyes of GameRant said that when compared to the previous iterations, the Naga 2014 has better buttons and is more user-friendly. He recommended the mouse to people who liked the previous iterations and to people who wish to have better control in MMOs. Marshall Honorof said the mouse is guaranteed to appeal to MMO fans, but isn't very useful for other genres.|$|E

[...] 1.1 billion people [...] 18% of humanity [...] live below the World Bank's $2/day. Is this distribution of wealth and other goods just? What is the root cause of poverty, and are there systemic injustices in the world economy? John Rawls has said that [...] international obligations are between states as long as [...] "states meet a minimal condition of decency" [...] where as Thomas Nagel argues that obligations to the others are on an individual level and that moral reasons for restraint do not need to be satisfied for an individual to deserve equal treatment internationally.

2500|$|Humanitarian aid {{is argued}} to often not reach {{those who are}} {{intended}} to receive it. For example, a report composed by the World Bank in 2006 stated that an estimated half of the funds donated towards health programs in sub-Saharan Africa did not reach the clinics and hospitals. Money is paid out to fake accounts, prices are increased for transport or warehousing, and drugs are sold to the black market. Another example is in Ghana, where approximately 80% of donations do not go towards their intended purposes. This type of corruption only adds to the criticism of aid, as it is not helping <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> and may be adding to the problem. Only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as ‘least developed.’ This [...] "pro-rich" [...] trend {{is not unique to}} the United States. According to Collier, [...] "the middle income countries get aid because they are of much more commercial and political interest than the tiny markets and powerlessness of the bottom billion." [...] What this means is that, at the most basic level, aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{seventh and}} final season, {{consisting}} of 13 episodes, begins with Michael receiving an assignment from Andrew Strong (Jack Coleman), a high-ranking CIA official {{with whom he}} made the deal that got his team and Maddie set free. Strong made the deal because he believes Michael {{is the only person}} he can entrust with a dangerous mission that involves thwarting an American named Randall Burke (Adrian Pasdar) believed to be running freelance terror operations. Fiona has moved on to a new job with her new bounty hunter boyfriend. Sam and Jesse continue to help Michael despite, or perhaps because of, intrusions on their personal and professional lives. Maddie, meanwhile, is trying to get custody of Nate's son, Charlie, to keep him out of foster care. It turns out Burke {{is part of a larger}} organization, and he sacrifices his life in order to help Michael rescue a woman whom Burke called [...] "the key to everything": Sonya (Alona Tal). Michael and the team, including Fiona, begin working with Sonya to get deeper into her organization. As they do, Michael meets James (John Pyper-Ferguson), the man calling the shots for Sonya and Burke, and after passing some intense tests, Michael is welcomed into James's [...] "family". It doesn't take long for Michael to find out that James works for peace and justice in the world, but uses extreme methods to get what he wants. After Michael kills Sonya to protect Fiona, James sends his men to kill Maddie, Charlie, and Jesse. Maddie sacrifices herself to protect them and Michael shoots James, intent on taking him in custody. James blows up his own building, hoping to kill Michael and Fiona. They escape, but must be presumed dead to protect themselves. Strong releases Sam and Jesse, without imprisonment. [...] While the two of them contemplate continuing helping out <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> like they had for the past seven years, Michael and Fiona have made their home in a small town in Ireland raising Charlie as their own and being the family that Fi had always dreamed of with Michael as her husband.

60|$|Now, {{there is}} one thing in school-work which I wish to press on you; and that is, that you should not confine your work to the girls; but bestow it as freely on <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> more, and who (paradoxical as it may seem) will respond to it more deeply and freely--THE BOYS.

It will be a boon to your own sex as well as to ours to teach them courtesy, self-restraint, reverence for physical weakness, admiration of tenderness and gentleness; and it is one which only a lady can bestow. Only by being accustomed in youth to converse with ladies, will the boy learn to treat hereafter his sweetheart or his wife like a gentleman. There is a latent chivalry, doubt it not, in the heart of every untutored clod; if it dies out in him (as it too often does), it were better for him, I often think, if he had never been born: but the only talisman which will keep it alive, much more develop it into its fulness, is friendly and revering intercourse with women of higher rank than himself, between whom and him there is a great and yet a blessed gulf fixed.|$|E
