25|$|The {{development}} of fast algorithms for DFT {{can be traced}} to Gauss's unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it <b>to</b> <b>interpolate</b> the orbit of asteroids Pallas and Juno from sample observations. His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by Cooley and Tukey, who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even Fourier's results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.|$|E

500|$|Khurshid {{was born}} in 734/735, the son of Dadhburzmihr or Dadmihr (died 740) and {{grandson}} of Farrukhan the Great (died ca. 728), the first ruler (ispahbadh) [...] of the Dabuyid dynasty from whose reign coins are known. According to the traditional account, the Dabuyids had established themselves as the quasi-independent rulers of Tabaristan in the 640s, during the tumults of the Muslim conquest of Persia {{and the collapse of}} the Sassanid Empire. They owed only the payment tribute and nominal vassalage to the Arab Caliphate, and managed, despite repeated Muslim attempts at invasion, to maintain their autonomy by exploiting the inaccessible terrain of their country. A more recent interpretation of the sources by P. Pourshariati, however, supports that Farrukhan was the one who actually established the family's rule over Tabaristan, sometime in the 670s. In earlier works on the dynasty, Khurshid is named Khurshid II, due to erroneous interpretation of numismatic evidence, which led earlier scholars <b>to</b> <b>interpolate</b> a first Khurshid before Farrukhan, whose rule was thought to have begun ca. 710.|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} in New York City, {{the previously}} released [...] "Bow Down" [...] {{was incorporated into}} a track that became [...] "Flawless".

Organic approaches were taken when writing and recording [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] and [...] "Partition". When working with Detail and Timbaland on a beat that became [...] "Drunk in Love", she was inspired by what she described as pure enjoyment, as both she and Jay-Z free-styled their verses for the track in the studio. Similarly, the bassline of [...] "Partition", which Beyoncé found reminiscent of hip hop music during her early romance with Jay-Z, influenced her to accompany the track with sexual lyrics. She took to a microphone without pen and paper and rapped the first verse, finding herself initially embarrassed by the explicitness of the lyrics.

In 2009, Dev signed with Indie-Pop Records and moved to a loft in Los Angeles, California to begin working on her debut album. The Cataracs eventually made the beat for a song called [...] "Booty Bounce". Afterwards, a hook was written for the song and The Cataracs suggested <b>to</b> <b>interpolate</b> it into a track they were making for Far East Movement. Dev agreed to what would become [...] "Like a G6", and later said, [...] "It ended up being a massive song and gave me so much experience and opportunity and it was absolutely beautiful. Thank god I agreed to that!" [...] The song was released in April 2010 and reached the top ten on several charts worldwide, including the United States, where it reached the top position and sold over three million copies.
