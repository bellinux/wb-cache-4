5|$|In 1961 Sellers {{made his}} directorial debut with Mr. Topaze, {{in which he}} also starred. The film {{was based on the}} Marcel Pagnol play Topaze. Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers's directorial {{abilities}} received an unenthusiastic response from the public and critics alike, and Sellers rarely referred to it again. The same year he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed Only Two Can Play, a film based on the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling), and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell).|$|E

25|$|In Panjab, {{if a man}} dies on a bed {{his soul}} becomes a Bhoot (ghost), and a woman becomes a Churel. The Kharwars think that when the soul leaves the body, it becomes air but if it comes in contact with a person, the soul becomes troublesome. In western India {{especially}} Gujarat, any woman who dies an unnatural death is believed {{to turn into a}} Churel, also known as jakihn, jakhai, mukai, nagulai and alvantin. Originally, it was believed that only a low-caste woman <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> churel.|$|E

25|$|One final film in {{this period}} was an {{original}} work scripted by Daniella Carmi. The Woman Who Stopped Eating (1991) {{is the story of}} a troubled scriptwriter who wants to write a feature film about a woman who stops eating. She <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> film director who is also going through a crisis in his life, and together they begin to weave a story about this imaginary woman. The tension soon erupts, however, because the screenwriter wants to keep her story in the realm of the imaginary, while the director struggles to adopt a more realistic approach to the storyline. In some way, the story reflected the tensions marking Loevy's own career as both a documentarian and a dramatist.|$|E
25|$|During the {{celebrations}} a message is received that Hassan Khan's army {{has suffered a}} decisive defeat {{at the hands of}} Koroghlu's followers and it has been routed. There is a commotion among the guests. The feast <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> council of war. Everybody offers its own plan for suppression of the rebels. Khan's jester Hamza's curious offer is the most acceptable: it is to steal Koroghlu's favorite black horse the Ghirr Aat. This will trick Koroghlu to come to free his loyal friend, allowing Khan's men to capture him, depriving the rebellion of its leader. But who will have the courage to steal the horse from the rebels' tower (Chenlibel)? Bald-headed Hamza is chosen to steal the horse. The risk is that Nigar, Koroghlu's beloved who is in Khan's captivity will know of the plot. But it is a risk to be taken. Hasan khan agrees.|$|E
25|$|Battle of az-Zallaqah: At Sagrajas (Friday 23 October 1086) {{north-east}} of Badajoz, the Almoravids (12,000 or 20,000 men) under Yusuf ibn Tashfin and Andalusians (including Kings of Seville, Granada, Málaga, and Badajoz) {{defeat a}} predominantly Leonese-Castilian army (possibly 50-60,000 men including Jews, Aragonese, Italian and French) under Alfonso VI of León and Castile. The Andalusians encamp {{separately from the}} Almoravids. The Christian vanguard (Alvar Fañez) surprise the Andalusian camp before dawn; the men of Seville (Al-Mutamid) hold firm but the remaining Andalusians are chased off by the Aragonese cavalry. The Christian main body then attacks the Almoravids, but are held by the Lamtuma, and then withdraw to their own camp {{in response to an}} outflanking move by ibn Tashufin. The Aragonese return to the field, do not like what they see, and start a withdraw which <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rout. The Andalusians rally, and the Muslims drive Alfonso to a small hill. Alfonso and 500 knights escape in the night to Toledo. Al-Mutamid proposes that the Christians are pursued and crushed, but Ibn Tashufin retires back to his African domains leaving only 3,000 troops to defend the east of Al-Andalus. Al-Mutamid and the Almoravid generals Sir ibn Abi Bakr and Dawud ibn Aisha are reported to have fought well during the battle.|$|E

Nerone and Poppea enter and exchange words of love before Nerone departs.

It turns out that Scorpio is a criminal mastermind formulating a plot to take over the East Coast of the United States with a doomsday device, as he <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> screen and threatens the United Nations Security Council by declaring that he has got hold of the doomsday device and that they have 72 hours to meet his demand of gold.

500|$|The Creek Turnpike {{begins at}} I-44 (Turner Turnpike) exit 217 {{in the city}} of Sapulpa. This {{interchange}} only provides access from eastbound I-44 to the Creek Turnpike and from the Creek Turnpike to westbound I-44. The turnpike runs in a general southeast direction from this terminus towards the Creek–Tulsa county line, crossing over Polecat Creek. Upon crossing into Tulsa County, the toll road <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more easterly course. The highway enters Jenks less than one mile (approximately 1.6km) east of the county line. In Jenks, the highway has a modified cloverleaf interchange at US-75; the westbound Turnpike to southbound US-75 ramp is a directional ramp rather than a loop ramp. The Creek Turnpike then passes through the first of three barrier toll plazas. Near the interchange with Elm Street (signed as [...] "Peoria–Elm"; Elm Street is named Peoria Avenue outside of Jenks), the highway bridges Polecat Creek again, before crossing the Arkansas River into Tulsa.|$|E

During their first date, Chris reveals that he likes Connie, who is surprised by his kind heart and actually becomes attracted to him. As a result, Chris' popularity increases at school, which leads to accolades by the jocks, cheerleaders, and other socially powerful students. Meg tries to use the relationship to gain popularity herself, only to find herself snubbed off by Chris' newfound shallowness. That weekend night, Chris and Connie plan a house party at the Chris and Meg's house, but Connie becomes upset when she finds out that Chris is cheating on her with two other girls, making Connie a social outcast. She <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reluctant Meg, who relents when a javelin thrown by Chris impales Meg's shoulder. They publicly release a video of Chris dancing naked in his room in the style of Buffalo Bill from The Silence of the Lambs. Connie instantly becomes popular again, while Chris is rendered back to his low social standing and apologizes to Meg for everything, and he tells her {{what it is like to}} be a part of the [...] "in-crowd".|$|E
500|$|The {{breadth of}} The Final Frontiers {{locations}} led Goldsmith to eschew the two-themed approach of The Motion Picture {{in favor of}} leitmotifs, recurring music used for locations and characters. Sybok is introduced with a synthesized motif in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock discuss him en route to Nimbus III it is rendered in a more mysterious fashion. The motif also appears in the action cue as Kirk and company land on Nimbus III and try to free the hostages. When Sybok boards the Enterprise, a new four-note motif played by low brass highlights the character's obsession. The Sybok theme from then on is used in either a benevolent sense or a more percussive, dark rendition. Arriving at Sha Ka Ree, the planet's five-note theme bears resemblance to Goldsmith's unicorn theme from Legend; [...] "the two melodies represent very similar ideas: lost innocence and the tragic impossibility of recapturing paradise," [...] writes Bond. The music features cellos conveying a pious quality, while the appearance of [...] "God" [...] begins with string glissandos but <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dark rendition of Sybok's theme as its true nature is exposed. As the creature attacks Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more aggressive Sybok theme takes on an attacking rhythm. When Spock appeals to the Klingons for help, the theme takes on a sensitive character before returning to a powerful sequence as the ship destroys the god-creature.|$|E

Ben also compares Leslie's speech to the famous home run baseball player Kirk Gibson hit off of pitcher Dennis Eckersley during the 1988 World Series, despite Gibson suffering from injuries to both legs at the time. While bonding, Ron and Andy discuss the draft history of the Indianapolis Colts, the NFL football team of Indiana.

Will also eventually reveals that during high school, he and Ross initiated the episode's titular rumor: that Rachel is a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school, and {{even went so far as}} to reach Chandler's high school. Rachel reacts tearfully, claiming she never hurt Ross in high school, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though Ross shockingly reveals that this is in fact true, much to everyone's amusement and disgust. Monica comforts Rachel, saying that despite the rumor, she was still the most popular girl in their high school and reminds Ross that due to his rumor, he was 'put on the map' in the school. She then reminds Ross and Rachel that they are having a baby together and that some things are more important than high school. Will feels betrayed that Ross had a relationship with Rachel but then that <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high five when he discovers that Ross [...] "knocked her up but did not marry her."
