Bottle of wine in hand, Withnail declaims [...] "What a piece of work is a man!" [...] from Hamlet to an uncomprehending pack of wolves behind a fence in the London Zoo.

As Jack <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away</b> his butt has {{actually}} been burned by the candle.|$|E
50|$|Arthur has now {{permanently}} {{become a}} caveman in both mind and physical form, finding some food {{out in the}} wilderness. However, his primitive mind is unable to comprehend {{that he is not}} in fact outdoors, but now living inside the very Homo erectus display he so admired.

50|$|The film's {{denouement}} shows Johnjo's {{mother and}} Margaret Ward, {{the mother of}} the murdered boy, talking in the street. The latter shows the former a letter that she received from Johnjo apologizing for what happened and accepting a degree of culpability because even though he hadn't taken part, his being there because he was born had allowed it to happen. Both mothers see the truth in Johnjo's innocence, the flawed decency in his view on culpability and the tragedy that both will be deprived of innocent sons, albeit only one permanently. They embrace, before Margaret Ward <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two weeks later, Andy {{attempts}} to hang a tire swing for Heidi. Lisa and Joyce speculate about why Mr. Gordy hadn’t wanted people on his land {{and come to}} the conclusion that he wanted his ancestor to be remember for the good that he did and not the bad.

5000|$|In 2013, Romanelli {{directed}} a music video for hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar featuring artist Eddie Peake. The video was a two-part series for Lamar's song, [...] "Sing About Me (Part 1)" [...] off his album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. Part one {{was released in}} December and Romanelli conceptualized the idea between Lamar and Peake, two artists coming together to, [...] "lay ground to their legacy". [...] The video starts with Kendrick driving around his hometown, Compton. From there, the scene shifts to a warehouse where Peake begins {{to work on a}} spraypainting piece to correspond with the song and ends with Lamar entering the warehouse to look at the painting. Satisfied with what he sees, he <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away.</b> Though a simple premise, Romanelli's goal was to reinforce the ‘stream-of-consciousness’ style of the song itself.|$|E

5000|$|A {{book about}} the show came out around the time show premiered. In the book, Charlie Brown, just goes up to the team, and said the whole simple [...] "we don't need them" [...] line, <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away</b> as the whole team heaps abuse after abuse on him, until Linus steps in {{to stand up for}} him, but without telling them why. In the book, Schroeder is not shown berating the girls and Snoopy along with Linus, {{although}} he does in the television show. It is Schroeder who says: [...] "Those uniforms meant just as much to Charlie Brown, as they did to you. Probably more!". Also, at the end, Linus just comes up to Charlie on the pitchers mound, and without a word spoken, as if he knew, Charlie lets him use his shirt tail to hold up against his cheek like {{at the end of the}} show.|$|E
5000|$|After a tense moment, the man <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away,</b> {{slinging}} {{his weapon}} over his shoulder. The woman follows him, {{and the two}} walk along the city street. They {{stop in front of}} a store with a dress in the broken display window and she mutters, [...] "pryekrasnyy" [...] (прекрасный), the Russian word for [...] "beautiful". He hands the dress to her and tells her to go and put it on. She enters the building, which {{turns out to be a}} recruiting office. As she prepares to change into the dress, she notices the jingoistic enlistment posters on the wall. She grabs her rifle (a primitive [...] "blaster"), exits the office and angrily shoots at him twice, but misses. The man gets up, looks at her incredulously, and walks away. As night falls, she returns to the barber shop to sleep in the barber's chair, staring at the dress.|$|E
50|$|The cobra demon {{arrives at}} the magic shop and goes after Dawn. Dawn screams in fear and the cobra retreats. Realising that the cobra knows Dawn is the Key and is {{returning}} to inform Glory, Giles and Buffy go after the demon. Buffy catches up with it in a field near Glory's apartment and kills it, then lets out her pent-up frustration from her time at the hospital by continuing to beat up the lifeless cobra. Glory watches from a window, frustrated that her snake monster has failed to return in a timely manner. Joyce tells Dawn the truth about her health. Riley is there to comfort Buffy (wearing a turtleneck to hide his bite marks) but she refuses to accept comfort from him - she insists {{that she needs to}} stay strong for her family, refusing to cry. Joyce calls for Buffy and she <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away,</b> oblivious to his attempt to caress her face. Riley is left standing alone in the hallway, becoming increasingly frustrated with Buffy's inability or unwillingness to develop an emotional closeness with him, and to let herself be vulnerable around him.|$|E
60|$|They <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away,</b> Matt {{keeping the}} image of the tormented snake in his mind; it somehow mixed there with the idea of Pinney, and unconsciously {{softened}} him toward the reporter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now Bangu <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away,</b> {{stepping}} {{over the body}} of my mother, and all his people <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> after him, so that presently Zikali the Wise and Little and I were left alone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Monday,' she whispered--'Monday,' {{meaning that}} on Monday she should receive {{a letter from}} him. He nodded, turned, hesitated, looked at her, <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b> She {{remained}} at the window watching him depart.|$|R
50|$|The video {{starts with}} Chris {{and his friends}} (one of them being Famous Fresh) driving on a lonely road in the dark. His friends tease him how he’s “always chasing girls” and mention that his ex may be where they’re headed. Then the guys finally arrive to foggy club with cool {{fluorescent}} lights, where dancers in lingerie laying in hoops that are hanging from the ceiling. Chris looks around while flashes of a girl (his ex) pop up in his mind. The girl is dressed in tribal-like clothing with her hair teased and white paint on her body. The dancers end up being vampires and the dancer takes a bite into Chris' neck. Chris starts to chase around {{a girl in a}} black bikini top and she looks like the same girl who took a bite out of his neck. He basically takes a trip to another world when he’s in a grey, forest-like setting where people are running and jumping through the trees. The video ends with the girl he was having flashes of {{in the beginning of the}} video. She seductively looks at the camera before she <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away</b> into the forest.|$|E
50|$|As the {{expedition}} nears their intended destination, they discover tall trees snapped in half well above human reach. Techka tells them it {{is a sign}} the Sasquatch use to mark their territory and upon entering the valley, the team finds more footprints and sets up camp. They install a tripwire system around the perimeter and post lookouts. The team notes that the forest is eerily quiet that evening and well after dark, the inevitable happens. Multiple sensors begin to light up, the camp is attacked and we hear the same haunting wail as earlier. As the lookouts scramble for a clear shot with their tranquilizer guns, large boulders and branches are thrown in from multiple directions. Paul Markham is injured by one of the rocks and one of the shadowy creatures actually invades the camp and destroys most of the surveillance equipment. The attackers are eventually scared off and when daylight comes the team gets {{a good look at the}} devastation. There are many footprints around the camp but no signs of a dead or wounded Sasquatch. By now summer is almost over and winter storms are looming so the team packs up and begins their long trek back to civilization. In the final scene the camera pans out to a wide shot of the team departing, showcasing a picturesque view of the valley and its surrounding mountains. During the closing credits we see a large human-like silhouette, the same one seen in promotional movie posters, looking down at the camera from a hilltop as it slowly <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Daken meets Donna Kiel at a restaurant. Daken, {{attempting}} to make a joke, is stopped by a distressed and perturbed Donna. Donna forces Daken to admit why they are meeting, but Daken does not. An impatient Donna states to him that they were meeting up {{to find out if}} they are going to fall in love. Donna then calls him a coward, and a scared little boy due to him not saying this. Those comments anger Daken to the point of grabbing Donna and popping out his claws. Donna states that she was not part of the super hero, mutant, and clone club, and offered Daken a chance to admit who he truly is. She tells him that she is smart and Daken cannot hide himself from her. She says she does not want to be a cliché and wants to be real. Daken and Donna the share a long passionate kiss, before Donna stops the embrace. Daken questions why, and she tells him that he is a murderer, cop killer, and a monster. Daken laughs hysterically and then is smacked. Daken admits that this is who he is and has no compunctions regarding murder and sleeps well at night. Donna screams at him saying that he was not capable of feeling love, and just because they were both tortured by Roston and shared an addiction does not mean they should be together. She questions how she could ever fall in love with a man like that. Daken replies that she is the same as him. She denies this, saying that she has never killed anyone. Daken insists that Donna comes with him, so he can help her. He takes her to an underground basement. To Donna's surprise, she sees three men that are tied up and look like they have been tortured. Donna states that she is F.B.I. and that he is out of his mind. Daken says that she rationalizes her psychotic tendencies by catching other psychopaths. He gives her a gun and attempts to convince her to pull the trigger so she can release her repressed emotions and be free. Donna admits to Daken that this is true. Daken does achieve this goal, but not to the desired effect, as she points the gun towards Daken. She knows his healing factor is gone, and he can be killed. Before she can arrest him, Daken cuts off her hand in defense. Daken, in disbelief, asks her why she would do that. She replies that the world is better off without him. Daken covers her wound saying that she does not mean that, because she came back to save him and no one has ever done that for him. She says that she did not come back for him, but she was trying to stop a monster. Daken, in disbelief, <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away</b> after being rejected. As he enters the elevator, he makes a final attempt to gain her love by saying that he will change. She simply responds with [...] "No you won't." [...] Donna later walks to towards a police car asking for medical assistance. Daken had come to Los Angeles to build his empire, but after being rejected, lost his sense of self, purpose, and drive.|$|E
