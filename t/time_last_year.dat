500|$|On July 5, Davis {{was sent}} back down {{to make room for}} Josh Hamilton who was coming off the {{disabled}} list. Although he had 15 home runs in 258 at bats, he was leading the American League with 114 strikeouts and had, on June 21, become the quickest player in Major League history to reach 100 strikeouts, requiring only 219 at bats. His batting average was at [...]202. While talking about the Rangers' handling of another player, Julio Borbon, in 2010, Washington mentioned the decision to send Davis down in 2009: [...] "We gave Chris a good amount of <b>time</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> With young players, they can look bad for 100 at bats and then turn it around the next 100 and look exactly like you want them to." [...] With the RedHawks, Davis played 44 games, batting [...]327 with six home runs, 12 doubles, and 30 RBI.|$|E
500|$|The season {{introduces}} a new title graphic for the series, replacing {{the one that}} appeared {{for the first two}} seasons, as well as a new aircraft for the team called Zephyr One, designed by series visual effects vendor FuseFX. Glenn Hetrick again worked with the make-up and visual effects departments to design and create the more [...] "unique"-looking Inhumans, such as Lash, after having worked on Raina during season two. Willig's Lash make-up initially took 6 hours to apply, but the make-up team was able to reduce the time to 4.5 hours. Before a new Inhuman character can be introduced, the cost of creating their powers must be weighed, with Bell saying, [...] "Can we afford to produce this effect? Because every <b>time</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> Gordon [...] we went, 'Wow, that was [...]'" [...] For the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents' costumes, series costume designer Ann Foley made sure to reflect {{the fact that they have}} [...] "graduated from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to the more precise militaristic outfit they always imagined they were." ...|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at this <b>time</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> and assembling rough edits of scenes {{to see what it}} feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Spurs won the 1949–50 Second Division {{title with}} seven games to spare, scoring more goals and conceding fewer {{than any of}} their rivals, and were {{promoted}} to the First Division for the following season. In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much as anything else, I would rate our good <b>time</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> to the acquisition of Alf Ramsey." [...] After an uncertain start to the 1950–51 season, Spurs quickly recovered their form of the previous year and by Christmas were top of the table. Ramsey continued to play a key role, according to McKinstry playing [...] "the best football of his life": [...] "He was the master of strategy, the lynchpin of a side that built its attacks from the back, the scheming practitioner who put Rowe's plans into action." [...] His understanding of the game and authority on and off the field led to his teammates nicknaming him [...] "The General". On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion. [...] "I think fortune shone upon me very handsomely during the 1950–51 season," [...] Ramsey remarked in Talking Football—"After all, I was a member of one of the finest club teams in years".|$|E

In 1886 a new steamer {{was added to the}} line, and that year these steamers made twenty-six trips. In 1887 four steamers were running by the first of March, {{beginning}} a month earlier than previously, and the steamers have been running ever since. Last winter was the first one that fruit steamers ever came to Boston, and owing to that fact, since January 1, 114,963 bunches of Jamaica bananas have been brought to Boston, whereas during the same <b>time</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> only 24,042 bunches were received in this city. From March to November a steamer from Jamaica arrives every ten days, and from November to March every two weeks. In the winter time, when the weather is very cold, the Boston Fruit Company have a heating room which is kept at a temperature of about sixty degrees, and in this room may be put 10,000 bunches of bananas. Jamaica bananas are sold from the ship for from $1.40 to $1.50 per bunch for number ones, and for eighty cents per bunch for number twos, and third class bananas bring from forty to fifty cents. The prices are about forty per cent lower than last year, and it is claimed that the fruit is of much better quality, making a virtual decrease of over forty per cent in the prices of bananas in comparison to last year's figures." ...|$|E
