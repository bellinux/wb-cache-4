500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{sessions and}} programming {{took place at}} Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio. Sa-Ra member Om'mas Keith remarked on Badu's role at their studio, [...] "Sometimes she’d come through and pick a skeletal and other times the beats would get made right then and there." [...] Keith played instruments such as the Fender Rhodes, Roland Juno-106, and Roland SH-101. Of all her collaborators, Badu only let Husayn write lyrics for her on the album. Husayn said that because Badu had not allowed anyone to do this before, [...] "she {{had to go through}} some personal things to come to the point where she'd let somebody write for her in the manner <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> It was spontaneous {{but at the same time}} there was structure to it. It might not have the right expression, or the right enunciation. Writing is so personal. That was a big thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalists {{noted the}} tracks' {{instrumentations}} of guitars, bass guitar, drums, vocoded, robotic and female vocals, and synthesizers used to emulate orchestral instruments, and well as compositional {{elements of a}} variety of complex builds. Downes said that he used five synthesizers in making The Age of Plastic, which were used to [...] "fake up things and to provide effects we won’t use them in the manner that somebody like John Foxx does." [...] According to Horn: [...] "We used about three different drummers including one from Landscape and Johnny Richardson from The Rubettes, who’s really good. We also used the occasional session guitarist to play various bits and there were three or four girl singers involved. Apart from <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> everything ourselves." [...] Downes claimed of using George Shearing's trick of doubling melody lines in block chords very heavily on some of the songs.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig Stanford, Professor of Biological Sciences and Anthropology at the University of Southern California, {{gave the}} book a {{generally}} positive review in American Scientist, but offered critique {{by suggesting that}} [...] "f there is a flaw in this tightly written, insightful book, it is that Wade provides perhaps {{too many of the}} stock examples of human evolution. In my view, he spends too much time and space attempting to convince the reader <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> indeed evolve from apes (duh!) and that our own social behavior and cognition have roots in the deep human past." [...] Peter Dizikes of The New York Times also gave a mostly positive review, calling it a [...] "timely and informative survey." [...] However, he criticised Wade's claim that [...] "the development of lactose tolerance shows broadly that 'genes respond to cultural changes'", and posited the alternative view that it is [...] "a case of genes responding to an environmental change produced by society – the abundance of milk-producing cattle – and not to any abstract cultural practice." [...] Dizikes also took issue with Wade's use of the word [...] "race", saying that the [...] "judgment that these regional genetic tendencies constitute 'races' has no deep scientific rationale, either. Such labels are generalizations situated atop a complicated intermingling of populations." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli {{to direct the}} song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par {{in comparison to the}} quality of the music. They scrapped the first video and re-filmed it with director Andy Morahan, changing the plot, scenery and imagery. After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how [...] "the special treatment really upset" [...] him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, [...] "they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal." [...] Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000. After the reports were made, Don Ienner, the president of Sony, refuted the claims, calling them [...] "total bullshit" [...] although admitting, [...] "If we're going to take the time and effort <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> with Mariah, on every level, then we're going to image her the right way. If it costs a few extra dollars to make a splash in terms of the right imaging, you go ahead and do it." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 1938, White {{represented}} Australia at an inter-governmental {{conference on}} Jewish refugees held at Évian, France, {{to discuss the}} growing numbers of Jewish emigrants seeking to leave Germany and occupied territories. [...] He expressed remorse after listening to stories from refugees during the conference, but ultimately hedged his offer of support, saying that, [...] "As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration". [...] Australia {{would go on to}} accept 15,000 refugees over three years. White's reaction to the Australian government's support for the Munich Agreement was to diarise: [...] "I think we should hang our heads <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not stand up to the bully of Europe... It may yet mean peace but at what price?" [...] He called for stronger preparations at home in case of war, including the introduction of conscription. On 8November 1938, he resigned his portfolio, having discovered that Joseph Lyons had established an inner cabinet from which he was excluded. Lyons' response in parliament to White's resignation publicly highlighted the divisions in the UAP. White stood for the UAP's leadership after Lyons' death the following year but was eliminated early in the balloting, and Robert Menzies eventually became leader.|$|E
500|$|The final {{recording}} {{was made}} in August at Armoury Studios in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage built upon their first mix of the song, adding and subtracting parts, and completed final recording and mixing. The band kept the arrangement tight to preserve the song's dynamic, sweeping melody. [...] "The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going dynamically," [...] keeping the recording simple, Vig recalled. [...] "Besides the drums and bass and some percussive loops, there's {{a little bit of}} guitar that Duke and Steve did. There's not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There's a few little ear-candy things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> but it's all meant to work around Shirley's singing." [...] Although Garbage owned its own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin, for legal reasons the song could not be recorded in a U.S. studio. [...] "The World Is Not Enough" [...] was completed, mixed and mastered {{at the end of the}} month, and the group returned to their recording studio in Madison to record their mix of the song. Garbage's version (the [...] "chilled-out remix") downplayed the classic Bond sound in favour of the band's style. Vig later said about the original recording, [...] "We're pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it's a Bond song." ...|$|E
500|$|While sources {{agree the}} name is a {{reference}} to North Texas' athletics teams, the Mean Green, there are conflicting accounts as to how, when, and why Greene received his [...] "Mean Greene" [...] nickname. When he first arrived at North Texas, the university's moniker was the Eagles. In 1966, Greene's first year on the varsity team, the team adopted the [...] "Mean Green" [...] moniker. Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against UTEP. One cheer was by Sidney Sue Graham, wife of the North Texas sports information director. In response to a tackle by Greene, she blurted out, [...] "That’s the way, Mean Greene!" [...] Bill Mercer, former North Texas play-by-play announcer, states Graham's thought behind the nickname was the Mean Green defense. Meanwhile, in the student section, North Texas basketball players Willie Davis and Ira Daniels, unsatisfied with the unenthusiastic crowd, began to sing, [...] "Mean Green, you look so good to me". The rest of the crowd soon followed. [...] "After <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it every game," [...] Davis said. [...] "A lot of people later on started associating it with Joe because his last name was Greene, but it actually started with that simple chant that Saturday night at Fouts Field.
