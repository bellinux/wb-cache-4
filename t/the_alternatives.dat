5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. <b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports {{indicated}} that compared to <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build, and need more manpower and more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} {{function for}} <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> (nonphosphorylating) pathway is {{to stabilize the}} reduction state of the ubiquinone pool (Qr/Qt), thereby avoiding an increase in free radical production. If the Qr/Qt were stabilized by <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway, then Qr/Qt should be less stable when <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway is blocked. Qr/Qt increased when we exposed roots of Poa annua (L.) to increasing concentrations of KCN (an inhibitor of the cytochrome pathway). However, when salicylhydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway, was added at the same time, Qr/Qt increased significantly more. Therefore, we conclude that <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway stabilizes Qr/Qt. Salicylhydroxamic acid increasingly inhibited respiration with increasing concentrations of KCN. In the experiments described here <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> oxidase protein was invariably in its reduced (high-activity) state. Therefore, changes in the reduction state of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> oxidase cannot account {{for an increase in}} activity of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway upon titration with KCN. The pyruvate concentration in intact roots increased only after <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway was blocked or the cytochrome pathway was severely inhibited. The significance of the pyruvate concentration and Qr/Qt on the activity of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway in intact roots is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{performed}} to investigate the potential role of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> complement pathway in the host's defense against bacterial L-phase variants and to gain insight into the subcellular component of gram-positive bacteria responsible for activation of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway. L-phase variants of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were able to activate <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway and consume C 3 in C 4 -deficient guinea pig serum in amounts comparable to their respective bacterial-phase parent organisms. Activation of the complement system via <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway resulted in death of the L-phase variants. Membranes prepared from S. faecalis L-phase variants, by either osmotic lysis or mechanical disruption, retained their ability to activate <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway. Treatment of the membranes by three different methods (water washes, hot trichloroacetic acid, and cold trichloroacetic acid) resulted in a greatly diminished ability of the membranes to activate <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway. In addition, the extracts derived from the membranes by water washes and by cold-trichloroacetic acid treatment were able to activate <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway. These studies indicate that these L-phase variants can activate <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway and suggest that membrane-associated factors {{play a role in}} <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway activation by S. faecalis L-phase variants...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> outcome {{refers to}} {{the outcome of the}} unselected option in {{decision-making}} tasks, which has significant influence on the chosen outcome evaluation. Most paradigms have presented <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> outcome either after or simultaneous with the chosen outcome, which complicates the observation on the brain activity associated with <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> outcome. To circumvent this perceived shortcoming, we modified the classic paradigm designed by Yeung and Sanfey (2004) such that <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> outcome was presented before the chosen outcome in each trial while an electroencephalogram was recorded. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by <b>the</b> positive <b>alternative</b> outcome was larger than that elicited by <b>the</b> negative <b>alternative</b> outcome, suggesting that the participants evaluated <b>the</b> positive <b>alternative</b> outcome as negative feedback. Moreover, the FRN and the P 3 elicited by the chosen outcome were influenced by the valence of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> outcome. <b>The</b> current study reveals that <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> outcome is treated as important information even though it is economically neutral...|$|R
5|$|Cardiff City had {{previously}} reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice, {{and two years}} earlier in 1925, they were defeated finalists. The 1927 final was the first for Arsenal, so as a result whoever won the match would take the trophy for the first time. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman {{held a press conference}} prior to the final on 21 April, where he announced that Horace Cope was injured and would be unable to play at left back. He doubted whether Syd Hoar or Alf Baker would be available as both of those were still recovering, and so he was leaving the selections for both the right half and outside left positions open should they become fit before the game. He saw Bill Seddon and Sam Haden as <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> should his first choice players not recover. When asked about who would win the game, he promised the press an answer after the match. In the end, both Baker and Hoar were named to the Arsenal team. The Arsenal team trained in Highbury on their own pitch prior to the final.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E

5|$|The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking {{alternatives}} for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. <b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> were narrowed to a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle, in 2003. The project's preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, {{was chosen by}} WSDOT in 2011. The $4.56 billion megaproject, which encompasses the SR520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and electronic tolls on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.|$|E
5|$|With {{a greater}} degree of {{certainty}} established, the Kepler team compared the models formed using Blender to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. The Blender technique allowed the Kepler team to rule out the majority of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> including, notably, that of triple star systems. Blender then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's {{ability to}} manage its high {{passenger}} numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains. This was {{directly related to the}} time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise that took a minimum of 2½minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops {{at each end of the}} line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run anti-clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd's Bush Green. For the eastern loop <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Aim of this {{presentation}} is {{to introduce a}} tabu search algorithm for a general scheduling problem modeled by means of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> graph. <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> graph is a mathematical model, {{which is based on}} a generalization of the disjunctive graph of Roy and Sussman [6]. It allows a detailed representation of many scheduling problems. It was successfully applied to several real world environments such as the production of stainless steel and tra#c management of railway networks. We next introduce <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> graph formulation, and then formulate a railway scheduling problem by means of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> graph.

5|$|With {{the coming}} of the Interstate Highways, the {{corridor}} was to be upgraded to Interstate standards. In late 1958, a group of motel owners whose properties were located on SR84 strongly objected to any routing of I-8 that would not go through the city of Casa Grande. Motel owners in Yuma proposed their own alternative in 1961 to the four routings of I-8 through the city that had been proposed, raising concerns about losing revenue from tourism. In January 1962, <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> were narrowed down to two, with one of them being the route supported by the motel owners. However, nearby school officials expressed concerns regarding that route, because 1200students would {{no longer be able to}} walk to school if the freeway was constructed along that route. Later that year, a new route had been proposed, along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River. By 1963, work was in progress, with portions of the highway between Mohawk and Gila Bend, and between Gila Bend and near Stanfield upgraded. Other merchants objected to the routing, and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their concerns following the final approval of the route in 1964. A new park was to be built east of the Colorado River crossing, just opposite downtown; city officials hoped that this would give an improved look to the town as drivers first arrived.|$|E
