50|$|For {{chemical}} compounds with regular lattices such as sodium chloride and caesium chloride, {{a count of}} the nearest neighbors gives a good picture of {{the environment of the}} ions.

In caesium chloride each caesium has 8 chloride ions (at 356 pm) situated at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube and each chloride has eight caesium ions (also at 356 pm) at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube.|$|R
50|$|The cheek bulges, and {{the wide}} and deep {{depression}} below them, suggest a muscular arrangement associated with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, whereby {{it is possible for}} such an animal to pull <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth forwards as is characteristic of mammals, while in true reptiles <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth are fixed and very close to the articulation of the lower jaw. This is a significant arrangement, because even with a secondary palate an animal {{would not be able to}} suck unless <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth can be brought forward, allowing the mouth as a whole to close properly around the teat of a milk gland.|$|R
50|$|The {{coordination}} {{number of}} each atom {{in the structure}} is 8: the central cation is coordinated to 8 anions on <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube as shown, and similarly, the central anion is coordinated to 8 cations on <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube.|$|R
