One of these situations is when there are four screens in the settling chamber of the wind tunnel and after that by adding the <b>trip</b> <b>strip</b> in the contraction region of the wind tunnel the tests were repeated. In the next stage, three screens were removed from the settling chamber of the wind tunnel and the retests were done. Results showed that by adding the <b>trip</b> <b>strip</b> in the contraction of wind tunnel and with adding the screens, the amount of power decreased dramatically in compare with the situation with one screen in the settling chamber. This reduction in the amount of power showed that the fluctuations of longitudinal component of velocity, i. e. turbulence intensity decreased significantly.

40|$|Wind farm {{operators}} observe production deficits as machines age. Quantifying deterioration {{on individual}} components is difficult, but one potential explanation is accumulation of blade surface roughness. Historically, wind turbine airfoils {{were designed for}} lift to be insensitive to roughness by simulating roughness with <b>trip</b> <b>strips.</b> However, roughness was still shown to negatively affect performance. Furthermore, experiments illustrated distributed roughness is not properly simulated by <b>trip</b> <b>strips.</b> To understand how real-world roughness affects performance, field measurements of turbine-blade roughness were made and simulated on a NACA 63 _(3) - 418 airfoil in a wind tunnel. Insect roughness and paint chips were characterized and recreated as distributed roughness and a forward-facing step. Distributed roughness was tested in three heights and five density configurations. The model chord Reynolds number was varied between 0 : 8 to 4 : 8 ? 10 ^(6). Measurements of lift, drag, pitching moment, and boundary-layer transition were completed. Results indicate minimal effect from paint-chip roughness. As distributed roughness height and density increase, lift-curve slope, maximum lift, and lift-to-drag ratio decrease. As Reynolds number increases, bypass transition occurs earlier. The critical roughness Reynolds number varies between 178 to 318, within the historical range. Little sensitivity to pressure gradient is observed. At a chord Reynolds number of 3 : 2 ? 10 ^(6), the maximum lift-to-drag ratio decreases 40 % for 140 ?m roughness, corresponding to a 2. 3 % loss in annual energy production.

With trips skewed at + 45 deg, the secondary flows remain unaltered as the cross-flow proceeds from the passage to the turn.

Tests were conducted in the NASA Glenn 1 - by 1 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel during two entries in October 1998 and February 1999. Tests were run from Mach 2. 8 to 6. Integrated performance parameters and static pressure distributions are reported. The maximum contraction ratios achieved in the tests were lower than predicted by axisymmetric Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD). At Mach 6, the maximum contraction ratio was roughly one-half of the CFD value of 16. The addition of either boundary-layer <b>trip</b> <b>strips</b> or vortex generators had a negligible effect on the maximum contraction ratio. A shock boundary-layer interaction was also evident on the end-walls that terminate the annular flowpath cross section. Cut-back end-walls, designed to reduce the boundary-layer growth upstream of the shock and minimize the interaction, also had negligible effect on the maximum contraction ratio. Both the excessive turning of low-momentum comer flows and local over-contraction due to asymmetric end-walls were identified as possible reasons for {{the discrepancy between the}} CFD predictions and the experiment. It is recommended that the centerbody spike and throat angles be reduced in order to lessen the induced pressure rise.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{results for}} a given slot shaped channel with a 3 : 1 aspect ratio are presented using various configurations of a trapezoid shaped spiral wound strips to enhance swirl and tumble motion in the channel. The Reynolds numbers investigated range from 10, 000 to 50, 000 and {{are based on the}} characteristics of the fluid at the channel inlet. The ratio of absolute temperatures between the wall and fluid are on the order of 0. 8 to 0. 9. A combination of thermochromic liquid crystal techniques and thermocouples were used to create a temperature vs. time map. Duhamel's superposition theorem was then used to determine the local heat transfer coefficients (h) and heat transfer enhancement factors (Nu/Nuo). In one series of testing a straight center inlet with a radiused entry was used to reduce entry effects. In a second series of test a 90 degree inlet geometry was used to enhance turbulence at the entry. Three combinations of helical strips were tested using a single, double, and pentuple spiral design. The pitch of the helix remained constant in all tests at 0. 75 ? (18 mm) as well as the height of the strip at 0. 0625 ? (1. 6 mm), yielding a p/e (pitch/rib height) ratio of 12. The resulting flow in the channel creates a tumble motion as the main channel fluid encounters the strips and a swirl motion as the fluid is directed through the spiraling helix. Many studies involving heat transfer using swirl enhancement have been presented in literature using round passages with wire spring inserts or twisted tapes, typically used in heat exchangers. In turbine aero foils, particularly in the mid-span region, rectangular channels with various configurations of <b>trip</b> <b>strips</b> are used to enhance heat transfer.

40|$|Resume : In {{work package}} 2. 3. 1 "LNC Application Studies for 130 -seat Regional A/C" of the Clean Sky GRA LNC project, Fraunhofer proposes a {{high-lift}} wing having {{a leading edge}} depressed downwards (a. k. a. droop nose) for reducing noise radiated from the leading edge. As opposed to the precedent wing models, the current model has a droop nose extended almost over the entire wing from 18 % to 98 % span. Good aerodynamic performance (cl max = 2. 6 at 15 degree angle of attack) of this model has been estimated in CFD analysis conducted in a full-scale condition. Due to the Reynolds number effect, CFD analysis in a 1 : 6 -scaled condition has shown smaller cl max = 2. 0, smaller angle of attack and less abrupt stall behavior. The current study aimed {{to confirm that the}} same performance expected in the scaled condition is actually observed in a wind tunnel. For this purpose, a 1 : 6 -scaled half wing model was first designed and manufactured {{so that it can be}} set in three different configurations: (1) clean wing,(2) high-lift baseline having deployed TE flaps but no droop nose leading edge and (3) full high-lift with droop nose. WT tests with this model were performed in an automotive WT facility in Weissach, Germany. Flow speed was set at 40 m/s. Aerodynamic forces and moments were measured by a six-component balance at various angles of attack ranging from - 6 to 20 degrees with 2 degree step. In these tests, the model was placed upright on a platform covering a balancerig raised above the WT floor in order not to disturb the flow. In the tests with a transition <b>tripping</b> <b>strip</b> attached on the suction side near the LE, cl max of 1. 0 at AoA of 10 degree for the clean wing, cl max of 1. 7 at AoA of 8 degree for the high-lift baseline and cl max of 1. 9 at 12 degree angle of attack for the droop-nose configuration. All the configurations have less abruptstall behavior as expected. These results are in good agreement with those of the CFD analysis. In the test without the transition <b>tripping</b> <b>strip,</b> very similar results were observed in the clean wing and high-lift baseline configurations. In the droop nose configuration, however, a large cl max of 2. 5 at a very large stall angle of 20 degree was observed during the WT test. This results hould be more investigated. In addition to aerodynamic examination, aeroacoustic noise sources were also examined with an acoustic beamforming system during the WT tests. No noise sources would be detected for the clean wing. For both high-lift configurations, these were found at few points on the leading edge, at the outer flap and at one of the stay supporting the inner flap. No qualitative difference insource distribution could be found between these two configurations...|$|R

The methodology presents the theory and practical programming requirements for coupling existing computer design and analysis tools together into a new and powerful design system. The goal {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the computational advantages of using implicit sensitivity with the boundary element method (BEM) within this system over other more brute force methods.

In addition, the transition Reynolds num-ber based on the distance from the trips increased by a factor of 2. 4 for the smaller trips and by a factor of 1. 7 for the larger trips. Thus, tunnel noise had a substantial eect on roughness-induced transition. I. Hypersonic Laminar-Turbulent Transition Laminar-turbulent transition in hypersonic boundary layers is important for prediction and control of heat transfer, skin friction, and other boundary layer properties. Vehicles that spend extended periods at hypersonic speeds may be critically aected by the uncertainties in transition prediction, depending on their Reynolds numbers. Although slender vehicles are the primary concern, blunt vehicles are also aected by transition. 1 However, the mechanisms leading to transition are still poorly understood, even in low-noise environments. Many transition experiments have been carried out in conventional ground-testing facilities over the past 50 years. 2 However, these experiments are contaminated by the high levels of noise that radiate from the turbulent boundary layers normally present on the wind tunnel walls. 3 These noise levels, typically 0. 5 - 1 % of the mean, are an order of magnitude larger than those observed in ight. 4, 5 These high noise levels can cause transition to occur an order of magnitude earlier than in ight. 3, 5 In addition, the mechanisms of transition operational in small-disturbance environments can be changed or bypassed altogether in high-noise environments; these changes in the mechanisms change the parametric trends in transition. 4 Mechanism-based prediction methods must be developed, supported in part with measurements of the mechanisms in quiet wind tunnels...|$|E
40|$|As {{the role}} of {{unmanned}} underwater vehicles expands it becomes increasingly {{important to understand the}} nature of the fluid flow around them. This research examines the flow around two ellipsoids with generic shapes representative of streamline unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV). Although a significant body of work, both experimental and computational, exists for flow about spheroids the majority of this is for prolate spheroids with finer aspect ratio. This research examines the flow around a 3 – 1 prolate spheroid and a 4. 2 – 2 – 1 scalene ellipsoid. Many of the previous studies have focused on the major crossflow separation that occurs on a 6 – 1 prolate spheroid when placed at medium to large incidences. This study examines the flow around these bluffer bodies at low to moderate incidence in transcritical flow. These are the conditions that many UUV’s spend the vast majority of their time operating in, and is thus of importance when assessing their operational envelope. At low to moderate incidence a closed separation on the flank is found to be the dominant flow feature for the 3 – 1 spheroid and the 4. 2 – 2 – 1 ellispoid. For the 4. 2 – 2 – 1 ellipsoid at lower Reynolds numbers an open separation occurs on the flank upstream of the closed separation. An extended length of attached flow on the suction side of the symmetry plane was observed for these models at incidence. The reasons for this attached flow despite a considerable length of adverse streamwise pressure gradient are identified to be due to the influence of the azimuthal pressure gradient on the boundary layer. Ideally computational fluid dynamics (CFD) could be used to examine the flow about these shapes during the design process. However before this process is useful there needs to be an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques being applied. Calculation of the three-dimensional flow around these vehicles presents a number of significant challenges including boundary layer transition and boundary layer separation off smooth doubly curved surfaces. The experimental work has identified flow features and trends with Reynolds number; a considerable amount of quantitative data is also presented. The ability of CFD techniques to calculate the features and trends identified in the experimental work can be used as an indication of their veracity. Numerical studies using two-equation turbulence models modified to allow predetermined regions of laminar flow are presented. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the measured and calculated results are presented. Limitations identified in the CFD modelling techniques used include: premature boundary layer separation at the rear of the model, typically on the pressure side; and separation of the laminar region prior to the measured transition region at low Reynolds numbers. A number of experimental techniques were refined during this work. These include a quick and accurate method of applying discrete element boundary layer <b>trip</b> <b>strips,</b> which is particularly suited to three-dimensional shapes; improvements to a fast response total pressure probe; and an oil flow visualisation technique using a mixture that is close to neutrally buoyant and may be formulated to alter the viscosity over a large range...|$|E

This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away <b>trips.</b> The <b>strip</b> was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2015 Banksy {{published}} a 2-minute video titled [...] "Make this the year YOU discover a new destination" [...] about their <b>trip</b> to Gaza <b>Strip.</b> During the visit they painted a few artworks including a kitten on {{the remains of}} a house destroyed by an Israeli air strike. ("I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website—but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens") and a swing hanging off a watchtower. In a statement to The New York Times Banksy's publicist said,I don't want to take sides. But when you see entire suburban neighbourhoods reduced to rubble with no hope of a future—what you're really looking at is a vast outdoor recruitment centre for terrorists. And we should probably address this for all our sakes.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was during}} the height of this battle that another of our planes was lost to enemy action. On 1 February 1943, several flights of the squadron's planes reached the Wau strip {{simultaneously}} with 20 Japanese bombers and several fighters. The bombers dropped their loads on the strip and the fighters took after the squadron's aircraft. All escaped except for [...] "Early Delivery," [...] piloted by Lt. Robert H. Schwensen. The plane was last seen with two Zeros on its tail. Coincident with the Wau battle, the 33d planes were required to carry supplies to Kokoda, Doboduro, Buna, and dropping missions on the various battle fronts in Papua inaccessible to air strips. Casualties were usually evacuated on the return <b>trips</b> from these <b>strips.</b> The planes, upon approaching Wards Drome, would fly a distinctive colored streamer, indicating wounded aboard, and would be met innned1ately upon landing by American and Australian ambulances.|$|R
5000|$|After {{writing a}} misogynistic and {{controversial}} essay - even Warholic finds it [...] "harsh on the chicks" [...] -, opining {{that women who}} create [...] "abrogate their own psychobiology", Eyestones takes a break from writing and invites Laura on a Summer vacation drive across the country. During their tour their incompatibility becomes more apparent. Back in Boston, they start to drift apart, and Laura becomes obsessed with the Craven Slucks, a local rock band, throwing herself at its lead singer Jeff. Eyestones, after the Christmas Party of the office, joins his coworkers for a <b>trip</b> to the <b>strip</b> bar. Crayola de Blu, the seductive main attraction, {{is none other than}} his adored Rapunzel; he is angry, feels cheated, lost and deprived. In his crisis he determines that all this was his own shortcoming and that he had exploited Laura. Confessing his failures to Duxbak, Eyestones realizes that he has to ask for forgiveness. He tries to see Laura to amend, but due to a misidentification gets shot and killed. Laura, lonely and desolate, hangs herself.|$|R
500|$|The ninth track from Unorthodox Jukebox, [...] "Money Makes Her Smile", is {{the result}} of a <b>trip</b> to a <b>strip</b> club done by Mars and Diplo, who {{afterwards}} decided to create an [...] "anthem" [...] for it, since Mars' debut solo single was an awful song to be played in such place, according to him. The recording was described as a [...] "strip-club-directed banger", infused with disco elements. Its composition includes [...] "rapid-fire chants, breathless percussion, propulsive electronic blips" [...] along with [...] "rave sirens and hardcore punk rattle". Lyrically, the song describes a gold digger who can only be satisfied by [...] "fat stacks of money". The album's final song of the standard edition, [...] "If I Knew", is a Sam Cooke-inspired ballad which incorporates soul and doo-wop nuances. It lyrically delves on themes of regret. [...] "Old & Crazy", a duet between Mars and Esperanza Spalding, was included on the deluxe version of Unorthodox Jukebox. Jeff Bhasker, one of the track's producers, confessed that the song is reminiscent of the sound of a 1920s Paris club. He went on explaining that its process began with Emile Haynie producing a beat and Bhasker adding a sample of a Django Reinhardt recording over it.|$|R
40|$|Dual phase (DP) and transformation-induced {{plasticity}} (TRIP) steels {{have received}} a significant attention in automotive industry due to their high strength and good ductility. At present, they are industrially manufactured using hot rolling and cold rolling followed by intercritical annealing. Alternatively, strip casting is another potential way to produce these steels, which will significantly reduce energy consumption. Thus, for the first time, {{an investigation into the}} possibility of production of DP and <b>TRIP</b> steels using <b>strip</b> casting was carried out in this work on the laboratory scale. For DP and TRIP steels, the processing parameters for simulated strip casting technique were determined based on prior austenite microstructures and continuous cooling transformation diagrams. The effects of interrupted cooling temperature, the amount of deformation and deformation temperature on microstructure evolution and tensile properties were studied in depth. The influence of isothermal bainite transformation (IBT) temperature on microstructure and mechanical behaviours of the TRIP steel was also investigated. Typical microstructures of DP and TRIP steels were obtained in strip cast steels, which were characterised using X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrometry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) and atom probe tomography (APT). The strain hardening behaviour after tensile tests was analysed using modified Crussard – Jaoul model. The strengthening after deformation was predominantly ascribed to grain refinement and dislocation strengthening. The mechanical properties of strip cast DP and TRIP steels outperformed industrially produced DP 600 and TRIP 690 steels, respectively, indicating the feasibility to produce these two steels using strip casting. For DP steel, the average ferrite grain size was significantly refined from ~ 25 to ~ 3 μm by the triggering of strain-induced ferrite (SIF) formation when the samples were deformed between 700 and 800 °C at a reduction of ~ 0. 41. The EBSD maps were segmented into polygonal ferrite, SIF and second phase regions using mean angular deviation and grain size. A diffusional mode for SIF formation was suggested based on the similarity in dislocation substructure features, misorientation angle distribution and the deviation from theoretical orientation relationships between polygonal ferrite and SIF. The contribution to strain hardening from every microstructure constituent was analysed using modified iso-work modelling. The effects of neighbouring phases, retained austenite (RA) size and morphology on its carbon content were studied using site-specific APT correlated with EBSD. The results highlighted the dominant role of neighbouring phases on the carbon content in the RA. The analysis of C and Mn partitioning across the interfaces between the RA and ferrite in bainite showed that it could be explained using either diffusional mechanism of bainite formation and/or diffusionless one followed by tempering...|$|R
