5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators <b>to</b> <b>recount</b> Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E

Melissa was his husband in this life, and had been taken to a Nazi concentration camp by a Gestapo officer who was The Smoking Man. Mulder also recalls his past life from the Civil War, when he was a man named Sullivan Biddle, while Melissa was Sarah Kavanaugh; Scully, Mulder claims, was his sergeant.

5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together <b>to</b> <b>recount</b> a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E

25|$|Machaut {{survived the}} Black Death that devastated Europe, and spent {{his later years}} living in Reims {{composing}} and supervising the creation of his complete-works manuscripts.

25|$|While many {{examples}} exist, {{the classic example}} was reported by Goody and Watt (1968). Written records prepared by the British in Ghana in the early 1900s show that Ndewura Jakpa, the seventeenth century founder {{of the state of}} Gonja, had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised <b>to</b> <b>recount</b> that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created. Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.|$|E
25|$|According to Henry Krystal, {{individuals}} {{suffering from}} alexithymia think in an operative way and {{may appear to}} be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend <b>to</b> <b>recount</b> trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals lack imagination, intuition, empathy, and drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.|$|E

Cody showed an early interest in the creation of kites capable of flying to high altitudes and of carrying a man. Leon also became interested, and the two of them competed to make the largest kites capable of flying at ever-increasing heights. Vivian too became involved after a great deal of experimentation.|$|E
