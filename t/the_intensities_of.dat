To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F(q), which may be inverted to obtain the electron density f(r).|$|E

The main concepts: <b>The</b> <b>Intensity</b> <b>of</b> Experience and <b>The</b> Dynamics of Experience, are described in the theoretical part.

The second chapter is aimed at Experiential Courses, their background and history, principles of Experiential Education and Dramaturgy of Experiential Education Courses. The main part of the thesis is the third chapter, which is devoted to quantitative-qualitative research. This research is focused on <b>The</b> <b>Intensity</b> <b>of</b> Experience evaluated by the participants, which the author further compares with <b>The</b> <b>Intensity</b> <b>of</b> Experience intended by instructors.

5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by <b>the</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to examine <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> steel use and to test if it {{exhibits}} an inverted U-shaped form as <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> use hypothesis suggests. This hypothesis states that <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> metal use in a country is related to its economic development. This thesis also investigates if high, middle and low income countries affect <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> steel use differently. The theoretical framework used in this thesis is <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> use hypothesis.

5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Russian research team led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of bismuth-209 and lead-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 and manganese-55 respectively. Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, {{and the other with}} an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the isotope bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter dubnium-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive {{discovery of}} bohrium at Darmstadt in 1981. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.|$|E
5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. <b>The</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Extreme {{rainfall}} {{events can}} have severe impacts on society, so possible long-term changes in <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> extreme events are of concern. Testing for long-term changes in <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> extreme events {{is complicated by}} data inhomogeneities resulting from site and instrumentation changes. Using rainfall data from stations in South Africa that have not involved site relocations, but which have not been tested for inhomogeneities resulting from changes in instrumentation, a method of testing for changes in <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> extreme events is adopted. Significant increases in <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> extreme rainfall events between 1931 – 1960 and 1961 – 1990 are identified over about 70 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10 -year high rainfall events has increased by over 10 % over {{large areas of the}} country, except in parts of the north-east, north-west and in the winter rainfall region of the south-west.

25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate <b>the</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate <b>the</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E
