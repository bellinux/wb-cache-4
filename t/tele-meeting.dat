40|$|A {{communication}} platform is described {{that supports the}} fast implementation of networked multimedia applications with conference character and collaboration features. The platform exhibits {{the notion of a}} site as one of its main abstractions. A site is a collection of workstations, media input and output devices that are, in terms of control, tightly coupled. Connection and application control is centralized within one site, but distributed among different sites. The platform exports a programming interface with high-level abstractions for session and connection control, allowing application developers to concentrate on scenario and user interface design. The platform was implemented {{in the course of the}} European Beteus (Broadband Exchange for TransEuropean Usage) project. A <b>tele-meeting</b> and a tele-teaching application were developed on top of it. Platform components and applications were tested on the European ATM pilot network over a period of nine months. The paper first describes platform architecture and programming interface; it then talks about the implementation of platform and applications, and their deployment in the harsh environment of a trans-national broadband pilot network...|$|E

Our system supports networked haptic handshakes for the greeting, networked AR (Augmented Reality) for the augmenting the remote real object with the virtual object, and the network interaction share to the virtual object among participants using VRPN (Virtual Reality Peripheral Network). First, we describe a haptic-based network handshake that enables us to use the sense of sight, hearing, and touch all together with haptic device and video conferencing. Second, we present a networked AR system that supports augmentation of remote real object with local virtual object using ARToolKit and DV video streaming technique using DVTS. This makes AR system be possible with the situation that real object does not exist local area. Third, we propose a networked interaction with AR {{that supports the}} share of interactions to the virtual object that is augmented to the real object using AR technique. This concept provides interaction to virtual object at any participants and supports {{the share of the}} interaction result with all the participants in the network. The AR and network interaction concepts are integrated and implemented using ARToolKit, VRPN and DVTS. Here, we call it as DV-ARPN (Augmented Reality Peripheral Network) ...|$|E
40|$|Multimedia is an {{important}} issue that drives the request for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) communication. The usage of multimedia features in a collaborative work environment is the core of BETEUS- Broadband Exchange for Trans-European USage. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of the BETEUS communication platform. BETEUS is a european project funded by the EC which is aiming at providing a platform for the support of CSCW applications such as tele-teaching, <b>tele-meeting</b> or tele-seminar. The communication platform is the part of the overall BETEUS platform that provides end-to-end connectivity between BETEUS sites. The realization of the communication platform is constrained by the services available on the European ATM pilot. The development of the BETEUS application platform is independent from the actual support of the underlying communication infrastructure. Although all BETEUS user sites run FORE ATM 200 switches, this was not obvious when the design of the communication platform was started. But, at that time, it was apparent that IP connectivity was available for all partners either directly over ATM or SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Service). The communication platform can be extended so that IP multicast facilities can be used for point-to-multipoint communication as is requested by teleteaching applications. The paper discusses the services offered by the European ATM pilot. Since the BETEUS communication platform is designed to provide reliable connectivity between BETEUS user sites, sites are connected by a fully meshed network using ATM VPs (Virtual Path), i. e. permanent virtual channels (PVC). PVCs are based on the semi-permanent virtual path service (Section 2. 2). Such a service has been considered most appropriate with respect to the design considerations of the BETEUS communication platform 1...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} shift in the method of dissemination of knowledge derived from research over the last millennium. Letters between scientists in the renaissance era were largely supplanted by published proceedings of face to face meetings in the 17 th and 18 th centuries, and subsequently in the 19 th century by journals of collected papers on a topic, designed to enable transmission of ideas and data to a worldwide audience, albeit slowly and at some cost. Now, ideas and data are distributed freely and rapidly over the internet, and thinking is advanced largely through face to face meetings and <b>tele-meetings.</b> Rarely read, and even less rarely cited, the majority of articles in journals, which have largely been transformed into e-information, are used mostly as a metric of research success – a milestone towards the next grant. Nevertheless they provide {{the basis of the}} evidence chain behind current opinion, and should be preserved to enable training of the next generation in the use of knowledge, and to ensure a clear understanding of how we have reached the beliefs we currently hold. Knowledge on the internet is evanescent, a truth too easily re-written to suit the need of the day, and the challenge for the librarians of the future will be firstly to select the key material from the internet that have shaped current scientific thinking in face of an exponentially exploding volume of e-information, and then make this permanently available...|$|R

Hajautettujen, verkotettujen ja verkottuneiden organisaatioiden määrä on kasvanut viime vuosina. Samalla niiden toimintatavat ja liiketoimintaprosessit ovat muuttuneet ja ryhmätyöskentelyn tarpeet lisääntyneet. Vaikka työtekijät eivät työskentelisikään samassa paikassa, dokumenttien ja muiden tietojen on oltava helposti saatavilla, ja kommunikoinnin kollegojen kanssa on onnistuttava. Computer {{supported}} co-operative work (CSCW) is {{a multidisciplinary}} research discipline studying technological solutions to support {{different kinds of}} works in social contexts. During the past years, particular interest has been laid on distributed and real-time works. Systems to support these are numerous ranging from videoconferences and <b>tele-meetings</b> to mobile connections. But, technologies are usually designed from the organisational viewpoint, for a purpose. Changing work practices and individual users' preferences are often not considered enough so the systems are unusable in varying situations or purposes. In this dissertation, {{the focus is on}} individual users and on support of their dissimilar work practices. In addition, no definite context, situation or purpose is emphasised. Instead, the aim is to study generic situations so that the CSCW system can be used in various ways in multiple different cases. As a hypothesis, it is assumed that this can be achieved by combining multiple communication and collaboration media, for instance audio, video, text chat, and whiteboard, into an aggregate. In this dissertation, it will be studied why, how, and in what way can these media be integrated, and furthermore, whether such aggregate improves individual users' work practices. Theoretical bases are derived from CSCW studies. An application is built and introduced into two different organisations where it is evaluated by using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Consequently, the dissertation reports the results of a constructive research process. The main contributions can be divided into three categories: the proving of the hypothesis and other theoretical suggestions; technically-oriented suggestions, such as integrating the media at the presentation level; and development problems because of the disparity of CSCW and information systems development (ISD) disciplines. This study, first, suggests that future CSCW systems should combine multiple communication and collaboration media into an aggregate, second, it proposes how it can be done, and third, shows a need for ISD methods from the individual users' viewpoin...|$|R
