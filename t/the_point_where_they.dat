5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E

5|$|Kilner {{first came}} into the Yorkshire side as a batsman. He was {{considered}} a good, reliable batsman when he began, although his style was regarded by Yorkshire critics as unorthodox to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> disapproved {{of some of his}} unusual, eccentric shots. For Yorkshire, he appeared high in the order, but batted between number seven and number nine for England. If the circumstances of the game demanded it, he was able to play slowly and defensively and restrain his naturally aggressive style. He was particularly effective while playing the drive and pull shot. For most of his career, his effectiveness as a batsman was not compromised by his improvement and increasing workload as a bowler.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to compress a small pellet known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet reached <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E

5|$|Starfish {{sometimes}} have {{negative effects on}} ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically {{with the arrival of}} migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole benthic community. Asterias amurensis is one of a few echinoderm invasive species. Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> threaten commercially important bivalve populations.

5|$|After a 71-win 1991 season, the Yankees {{replaced}} their incumbent manager, Stump Merrill, with Buck Showalter, who {{increased the}} playing time given to young players. While the 1992 Yankees were 20 games behind the AL East winner, offseason acquisitions—third baseman Wade Boggs, pitcher Jimmy Key, and outfielder Paul O'Neill—helped the 1993 team to an 88–74 record and New York's highest finish (second) in seven seasons. By 1994, the Yankees had progressed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> led the AL with a 70–43 record {{going into the}} homestretch of the regular season. Their campaign was cut short by a players' strike, {{which resulted in the}} cancellation of the playoffs and 1994 World Series. Many media members believed that the Yankees might have reached the World Series if not for the strike. A year later, the team reached the playoffs and gave Mattingly his first career postseason appearance by winning the first AL wild card berth, but it was eliminated in a five-game Division Series (ALDS) against the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E

5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee {{because of her}} personality, and her relationship with other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew longer as the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's sex appeal by having her skirt shorter {{even though she is}} also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that she was happy with how Lenalee had matured, {{and at the same time}} become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series when they were both the same height.|$|E
5|$|The {{rendezvous}} and first-ever docking {{between two}} spacecraft was successfully completed after 6.5 hours in orbit. Contact {{with the crew}} was intermittent {{due to the lack}} of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. Out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Orbital Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) of the Gemini spacecraft. Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were turning about once per second, which meant the problem was in their Gemini's attitude control. Armstrong decided the only course of action was to engage the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turn off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft would have to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring made one of the thrusters become stuck in the on position.|$|E
5|$|The {{years after}} the Black Death left many women widows; in the wider economy labour was in short supply and land was {{suddenly}} readily available. In rural areas peasant women could enjoy a better standard of living than ever before, but {{the amount of work}} being done by women may have increased. Many other women travelled to the towns and cities, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> outnumbered men in some settlements. There they worked with their husbands, or in a limited number of occupations, including spinning, making clothes, victualling and as servants. Some women became full-time ale brewers, until they were pushed out of business by the male-dominated beer industry in the 15th century. Higher status jobs and apprenticeships, however, remained closed to women. As in earlier times, noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands' absence and again, if necessary, defended them in sieges and skirmishes. Wealthy widows who could successfully claim their rightful share of their late husband's property could live as powerful members of the community in their own right.|$|E

5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{most people}} in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the {{influence}} of the Roman Empire and, later, the Catholic Church, use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were Indo-Europeans, shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given their gods. During the later period of the Roman Republic, Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> became virtually indistinguishable. When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: Mercurius (for Hermes), Venus (Aphrodite), Mars (Ares), Iuppiter (Zeus) and Saturnus (Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with Neptūnus (Poseidon). Uranus is unique in that it is named for a Greek deity rather than his Roman counterpart.|$|E
