Richard Hodgson held six sittings with the medium Rosina Thompson and came to the conclusion she was a fraud as he discovered Thompson had access to documents and information about her séance sitters.|$|E

50|$|Gunter rig is {{normally}} used on small gaff rigged sailing vessels, such as sailing canoes (not the International Canoe) and dinghies where the gaff is carried very nearly vertical, forming an extension to the mast {{so that the}} sail is triangular, resembling a Bermuda rig. The effect {{is to have a}} topmast (the gaff) which is a pseudo <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension</b> of the shorter mast. One reason given for the popularity of the gunter rig in dinghies is that the mast and yard are sufficiently short to pack neatly inside the hull when a boat is being trailed behind a car.|$|E

2500|$|The Flyer was {{the first}} {{monoplane}} designed, built and flown in the United States. [...] It incorporated several novel features, the most innovative {{of which was the}} method of achieving lateral control by means of reciprocating lateral (<b>telescopic)</b> wing <b>extensions,</b> which the pilot controlled via a steering wheel. Also unusual for a monoplane was the use of a pusher configuration, the engine also being mounted behind the pilot.|$|R
40|$|A {{transmission}} {{electron microscope}} (TEM) {{is much more than}} just a tool for imaging the static state of materials. To demonstrate this, we present work on studying the mechanical and electrical properties of carbon nanotube devices. Multiwall carbon nanotubes are concentrically stacked tubular sheets of graphite, where the spacing between each cylinder is simply the natural spacing of graphite. Using a custom-built in-situ nanomanipulation probe, we have shown {{that it is possible to}} slide the nanotube layers in a <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension</b> mode that exhibits low friction, demonstrating the potential of nanotubes as the ultimate synthetic nanobearing. During this <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension,</b> the electrical resistance of the nanotube devices increases, opening the possibility that these devices can also be used as nanoscale rheostats. We also briefly describe work on using electron holography inside a TEM to study the electric field distribution in nanotube field-emission devices and on using a nanotube itself as a biprism for electron holography. These measurements together demonstrate the wealth of information that can be obtained and frontiers that can be opened by putting operational nanodevices inside an electron microscope...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the controlled and reversible <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension</b> of multiwall carbon nanotubes, thus realizing ultralow-friction nanoscale linear bearings and constant-force nanosprings. Measurements performed in situ on individual custom-engineered nanotubes inside a high-resolution {{transmission electron microscope}} demonstrated the anticipated van der Waals energyÐbased retrac-tion force and enabled us to place quantitative limits on the static and dynamic interwall frictional forces between nested nanotubes. Repeated extension and retraction of telescoping nanotube segments revealed no wear or fatigue on the atomic scale. Hence, these nanotubes may constitute near perfect, wear-free surfaces. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) com-prise concentric cylindrical layers or shells of graphite-like sp 2 -bonded carbon, where the in-tershell interaction is predominantly van der Waals (1). In analogy to the well-known lubri...|$|E
40|$|Interwall {{interaction}} energies, {{as well as}} {{barriers to}} relative sliding of the walls along the nanotube axis, are first calculated for pairs of both armchair or both zigzag adjacent walls of carbon nanotubes {{with a wide range}} of radiuses. It is found that for the pairs with the radius of the outer wall greater than 5 nm both the interwall interaction energy and barriers to the relative sliding per one atom of the outer wall only slightly depends on the wall radius. A wide set of the measurable physical quantities determined by these barriers are estimated as a function of the wall radius: shear strengths and diffusion coefficients for relative sliding of the walls along the axis, as well as frequencies of relative axial oscillations of the walls. For nonreversible <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension</b> of the walls, maximum overlap of the walls for which threshold static friction forces are greater than capillary forces is estimated. Possibility of experimental verification of the calculated barriers by measurements of the estimated physical quantities is discussed. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|Aim: Morpho-functional data on {{the muscular}} {{arrangement}} and motoneurons activity within nerve pairs IV (N 4) to VI (N 6) emerging from the terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG) were correlated to the cyclic ovipositor extensions and retractions (calling behaviour) responsible for the pheromone release in the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar. Methods: In whole 2 – 3 days old calling females the firing patterns displayed by nerves N 4 to N 6 was simultaneously recorded with extracellular suction electrodes and coupled with EMG recordings (A-M System differential amplifier) of the muscles involved in calling behaviour; the behavioural output associated with motor unit(s) activity was video-monitored. All data were analysed by means of pClamp 10. 0. Results: Several different pairs of abdominal muscles, mostly innervated by N 5, were identified, while N 6 was found to mainly innervate the oviductal tract. N 4 appears to innnervate two muscle pairs only, both located in the abdominal wall. The spike trains {{of a number of}} motoneurons within both N 4 and N 5 were found to be time-related with changes in the relative position of the ovipositor, both in extension and retraction movements. Conclusions: In the female gypsy moth the sex pheromone release is brought about by the squeezing action due to the turtleneck-like folding and unfolding of the ovipositor cuticle during the <b>telescopic</b> <b>extensions</b> and retractions of the ovipositor operated by a coordinated motor programme, which is mainly sustained by the activity of motoneurons projecting from the TAG via N 4 and N 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of {{other forms of}} energy into mechanical work through the geometrical extension and retraction of nanomaterials has {{a wide variety of}} potential applications, including for mimicking biomotors. Here, using molecular dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that there exists an intrinsic energy conversion mechanism between thermal energy and mechanical work in the telescopic motions of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). A DWCNT can inherently convert heat into mechanical work in its <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension</b> process, while convert mechanical energy into heat in its telescopic retraction process. These two processes are thermodynamically reversible. The underlying mechanism for this reversibility is that the entropy changes with the telescopic overlapping length of concentric individual tubes. We find also that the entropy effect enlarges with the decreasing intertube space of DWCNTs. As a result, the spontaneously telescopic motion of a condensed DWCNT can be switched to extrusion by rising the system temperature above a critical value. These findings are important for fundamentally understanding the mechanical behavior of concentric nanotubes, and may have general implications in the application of DWCNTs as linear motors in nanodevices...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} properties {{of a wide}} range of nonchiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT) with nonchiral commensurate walls are studied. Equilibrium structures of SWNT and DWNT, as well as the interwall interaction energies of DWNT, are computed using a local density approximation within density functional theory with periodic boundary conditions and Gaussian-type orbitals. Based on ab initio structural characteristics, elastic properties of SWNT and DWNT are calculated. Relative motion of the walls of DWNT with different radii and chiralities is explored using ab initio results for the interwall interaction energies. Relative positions of nonchiral commensurate walls of DWNT which correspond to extrema of the interwall interaction energy are derived. For DWNT with incompatible rotational symmetries of the walls, the possibility of orientational melting is predicted. Ab initio values of barriers to relative rotation and sliding of the walls of DWNT are used to calculate threshold forces. For nonreversible <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension</b> of the walls, maximum overlap of the walls for which threshold forces are greater than capillary forces is estimated. A method for selecting pairs of nonchiral commensurate walls in multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) is proposed. © 2006 The American Physical Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of patterning and morphogenesis of vertebrate eye primordia are heavily debated. Taking {{advantage of the}} maternal effect of a zebrafish smad 5 null mutation (Mm 169), we investigate the effect of early signaling {{by members of the}} bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) on eye field patterning and optic vesicle morphogenesis. In contrast to previous Xenopus and chick studies demonstrating a late dorsalizing effect of Bmp 4 expressed in the dorsal neural retina itself, we show that patterning of the eye primordia already starts during blastula and early gastrula stages. At these stages, bmps expressed on the ventrolateral side of the embryo promote dorso-distal fates in the entire neuroectoderm, including the eye primordia. Despite a normal split of the eye field in the midline, the eye primordia of Mm 169 embryos fail to evaginate laterally. They display a concentric pattern with retinal cells in the center and optic stalk cells in the periphery, representing a flattened version of the topologic relationships present in the mature wild-type eye. Different interpretations of these latter findings are presented. They can be best explained with a model according to which zebrafish eye morphogenesis occurs as a <b>telescopic</b> <b>extension</b> of disc-like, concentric primordia, similar to the development of appendages from imaginal discs in Drosophila...|$|E
