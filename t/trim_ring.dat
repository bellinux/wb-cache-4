2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport {{was only}} a shadow of its former self for 1974. [...] With the Sportsroof model discontinued, Sport models were often {{difficult}} to distinguish from Gran Torino 2-doors. To add insult to injury, the Sport was even available with optional opera windows (on vinyl-roofed cars) and fender skirts. The Sport continued to have its unique emblems displayed on the grille, the C-pillar, and the fuel filler door, plus [...] "Sport" [...] script was placed by the C-pillar emblem. When opera windows were ordered, the script was placed below the [...] "Gran Torino" [...] nameplate on the fenders, and the C-pillar emblem was deleted. The laser stripe was no longer available, but a lower body multi-coloured non-reflective stripe was an option. The Sport now used the same vinyl door panel of the other Gran Torinos. The instrument package became a standard feature, as were 78 series radial ply tires (70 series used in 1973). Bucket seats remained an option, but now were a low back design with separate head rests. At extra cost, Sport door panels and seats could be highlighted with coloured stripes. The optional [...] "Magnum 500" [...] wheel was revised with the formerly chromed wheel rim replaced by a polished <b>trim</b> <b>ring</b> and argent painted spokes. [...] Performance was even more lackluster for 1974 models, with power down and weight up. The 1974 Sport had a shipping weight almost [...] heavier than a 1972 Sport.|$|E
50|$|Tires {{are mounted}} onto wheels that most often have {{integral}} rims on their outer edges {{to hold the}} tire. Automotive wheels are typically made from pressed and welded steel, or a composite of lightweight metal alloys, such as aluminum or magnesium. These alloy wheels may be either cast or forged. The mounted tire and wheel assembly is then bolted to the vehicle's hub. A decorative hubcap and <b>trim</b> <b>ring</b> may be placed over the wheel.|$|E
5000|$|... 1958: the Maverick model introduced, a more luxurious {{version of}} the two-wheel drive wagon. It could be had only with the four-cylinder engine. The main {{upgrades}} were in the introduction of two-tone paint with matching interior in two tones and the standard AM radio. It was distinguished by its extra stainless steel <b>trim</b> <b>ring</b> under the windows. The Maverick name came from the TV series of the same name, of which Willys was a sponsor.|$|E

The GT featured a blacked-out grille, dual body-side tape stripes, high-back bucket seats, wheel <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> dual racing mirrors, bright window frames, black instrument panel, deluxe door trim panels, and a simulated hood scoop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{convertible}} {{was generally}} more lavishly equipped than the sedan with dual rear ashtrays, twin map pockets, a visor vanity {{mirror on the}} passenger side, rear stone shields, and through 1969, wheel <b>trim</b> <b>rings.</b> Many of these items did not become available on other Beetles until {{the advent of the}} optional [...] "L" [...] (Luxus) Package of 1970.|$|R
5000|$|The Demon {{fastback}} {{was renamed}} [...] "Dart Sport" [...] {{in response to}} Christian groups' complaints about the 'Demon' name and devil-with-pitchfork logo. The high-performance model thus became Dart Sport 340, and 1973 saw styling changes {{to go along with}} the name change. The Dart Sport received the same new front end as the other Darts, and its taillights were changed to two lights per side, each with a chrome <b>trim</b> <b>ring.</b> These would remain unchanged through the 1976 model year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>trim</b> <b>ring,</b> usually black (It {{may have}} {{additional}} trim colors), that is found directly {{on top of}} the hosel on many woods and irons. The ferrule is mostly decorative, creating a continuous line between the shaft and the wider hosel, but in some cases it can form part of the securing mechanism between hosel and shaft. Ferrules of differing weights can fine-tune the center of mass of the overall club head, but for these minute adjustments, screw-in weighted inserts at specific points on the club head are usually used instead.|$|E

5000|$|A {{completely}} new generation body design emerged with the HQ series in July 1971, {{including the new}} Monaro 'LS' (commonly believed to mean [...] "Luxury Sports") model which featured four headlights and chrome <b>trim</b> <b>rings</b> taken from the Holden Premier sedan. There were no longer any six-cylinder versions of the Monaro GTS, just the locally manufactured 4.2 L (253 cu in) or optional 308 cuin L V8s or the top level GTS350 coupé, equipped with an imported 350 cuin L Chevrolet motor.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{changes were}} made at the {{traditional}} opening of the new model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of back-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to replace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from 170 to 200 cid L with an increase from , and an upgrade of the V8 engine from 260 to 289 cid L with an increase from [...] The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as the horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo covered by a <b>trim</b> <b>ring</b> with a 'Ford Mustang' logo. These characteristics made enough difference to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as [...] "1964½" [...] Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, {{once again}} {{the top of the}} line Oldsmobile series was the 98. Standard {{equipment}} included Safety-vee steering wheel, turn signals, air scoop brakes, electric windshield wipers, safety-spectrum speedometer, carpets with rubber inserts, padded dash, courtesy lamps, wheel <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> Star-lite headliner, two-speed windshield wipers, chrome roof side moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, windshield washers, electric clock, and deep twist carpeting.

50|$|The 66 and 68 were {{renamed the}} Dynamic 66 and 68 in 1948. The Dynamic 60 series were the {{smallest}} Oldsmobiles available and offered the greatest variety or body styles.

5000|$|On April 18, 2010, a blue {{prototype}} Spirit II (double-humbucker) XPL originally sold to Chris Hayes of Huey Lewis's News fame {{was sold}} on eBay. The auction included the original Gibson invoice with Hayes's name and shipping address, {{as well as}} a letter of appraisal from vintage guitar expert George Gruhn. The guitar's humbuckers had been changed to rail types, and the tremolo system was a floating Kahler style that used standard Gibson adjustable bridge posts, rather than the production Flyer tremolo that mounts to the body with a <b>trim</b> <b>ring.</b> A coil-tap switch had also been added amongst the guitar's standard controls. The guitar's serial number identified it as a very early 1985 model, and included an [...] "Original Gibson Prototype" [...] stamp screened {{on the back of the}} headstock.|$|E
5000|$|The Dyane was a {{development}} of the Citroën 2CV, and was intended as {{an answer to the}} increasingly popular Renault 4, which after its introduction in 1961 had affected 2CV sales. Like the Renault 4, the Dyane was designed from the outset as a hatchback with some other styling differences, such as conventional round headlamps set into the front fender with a squared stainless steel <b>trim</b> <b>ring</b> [...] - [...] as opposed to the old-fashioned separate units found on the 2CV [...] - [...] and stainless steel wheel embellishments as standard. It was and is often asserted that the Dyane was intended to replace the 2CV, but it was nevertheless aimed slightly higher in the Citroën range [...] - [...] between the 2CV and the Ami [...] - [...] and attracted a different clientele seeking the versatility offered by the Dyane's hatchback.|$|E
5000|$|When {{pressed steel}} wheels became common by the 1940s, these were often painted {{the same color}} as the car body. Hubcaps {{expanded}} in size to cover the lug nuts that were used to mount these steel wheels. An option on some cars was a chrome-plated <b>trim</b> <b>ring</b> that clipped onto the outer rim of the wheel, in addition to the center hubcap. The full wheel cover became popular that covered the entire wheel. These became increasingly decorative in styles and were typically made from chrome-plated or stainless steel. Basic automobiles came standard with simple, unadorned, and inexpensive hubcaps were called [...] "poverty caps" [...] or [...] "dog dish caps" [...] due to their size and shape. Various optional full wheel covers of various designs were optional or were standard equipment on higher trim models. Metal hubcaps not only help protect lug nuts (that hold the wheel on) from corrosion, but also offer an audible warning should a wheel nut work their way off. During the 1960s and 1970s, automakers also offered stainless steel spoke full wheel covers that simulated the look of traditional, and more costly, wire spoke wheels.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1969, the [...] "Dude Sport Trim Package" [...] was released.

The Dudes were only offered in the 1970 and 1971 model years and only 1500 to 2000 Dudes were produced.|$|R
5000|$|The sporty Diablo package {{began in}} 1978 as an {{equivalent}} to the El Camino's Royal Knight package (which was, in turn, an upgrade from the long-running Super Sport package). Both the Royal Knight and the Diablo carried a hood graphic not unlike that featured on the Pontiac Trans Am; the Diablo's was in a symmetrical flame pattern that resembled a demon. Besides the hood accents, Diablo also came with lower-body accent paint, body-color mirrors, black-trimmed window frames, a front air dam, color-matched [...] "Rally" [...] steel wheels with <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> and a large [...] "Diablo" [...] decal on the tailgate.|$|R
5000|$|The basic 1948 Jeepster {{included}} numerous deluxe {{features and}} interior fittings {{in addition to}} a high level of standard equipment that cost extra on other automobiles. These included, among many others, whitewall tires, hubcaps with bright <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> sun visors, deluxe steering wheel, wind wings, locking glovebox, cigar lighter, and continental tire with fabric cover. The Jeepster had Willys' World War II-proven 134.2 cuin L straight-4 [...] "Go Devil" [...] engine, and plastic side curtains, but its $1,765 price was about the same as a Ford Super DeLuxe club convertible with roll-down windows, fancier styling, and a V8 engine.|$|R

50|$|Duke and Duchess of Croydon: In another {{instance}} the Duke and Duchess of Croydon are {{hiding out in}} the hotel as {{they are responsible for}} a gruesome hit-and-run accident which made the headlines. The Duke had gone to a night club and the Duchess reaches the club to find her husband. On their way back the Duke hits a woman and her daughter and both the woman and her daughter died. However, in the accident the headlight and the <b>trim</b> <b>ring</b> of the car were damaged. The Duke and Duchess arrived back at the hotel and {{try to find a way}} out, so that there not the slightest suggestion of them being involved in an accident. When the room-service waiter arrives in the presidential suite with dinner, the Duchess intentionally hits him so that her dress gets spoiled. The Duchess creates a big issue over this, just to make her presence felt so that it can be interpreted that she was in the hotel. But the chief house officer Ogilvie gets a hint of it and tries to blackmail the Duke and Duchess. They finally reach an agreement that Ogilvie would drive their Jaguar to Chicago and a total of twenty-five thousand dollars would be paid to him. By the time the police identify the car with the broken headlight and trim pieces, Ogilvie would be out of New Orleans. The travel was supposedly on Thursday night at 1 am. Ogilvie gets a written note from the Duchess asking for permission to drive her car out of garage in case the garage officer asks for it. The moment he is driving the car out of hotel, Peter enters the hotel and they make eye contact, though Peter did not think much of it at the time. However, recollecting all the events - a Jaguar being driven by Ogilvie belonging to the Duke and Duchess - the broken headlight of the Jaguar - the fuss created by Duchess about the waiter - all establish a link towards the involvement of the Duke and Duchess. Peter inquires from the garage officer and is informed that Ogilvie had a written note from the Duchess and so was allowed to drive the car away, but somehow the note got misplaced. Peter informed police captain Yolles of the incident, but they could not prove it without any evidence. After working hard, the incinerator officer, responsible for garbage recycling, manages to find the note. When the note is shown to the Duchess, she frowns. The Duke then decides to admit his crime and decides to leave and steps into elevator no 4.|$|E
40|$|<b>TRIM</b> <b>RING</b> finger {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown {{to play an important role}} in cancerogenesis, in the pathogenesis of some human hereditary disorders, and in the defense against viral infection, but the function of the majority of TRIM proteins remains unknown. Here, we show that <b>TRIM</b> <b>RING</b> finger protein TRIM 2, highly expressed in the nervous system, is an UbcH 5 a-dependent ubiquitin ligase. We further demonstrate that TRIM 2 binds to neurofilament light subunit (NF-L) and regulates NF-L ubiquitination. Additionally, we show that mice deficient in TRIM 2 have increased NF-L level in axons and NF-L-filled axonal swellings in cerebellum, retina, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. The axonopathy is followed by progressive neurodegeneration accompanied by juvenile-onset tremor and ataxia. Our results demonstrate that TRIM 2 is an ubiquitin ligase and point to a mechanism regulating NF-L metabolism through an ubiquitination pathway that, if deregulated, triggers neurodegeneration...|$|E
