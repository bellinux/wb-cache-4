5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E
