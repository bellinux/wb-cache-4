5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar's next {{opponent}} was Big Show and Heyman {{was convinced}} {{more than anyone}} that Lesnar could not win, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him out of defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the title against Show at Survivor Series on November 17, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Show, but Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. This allowed Show to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair to win the title. This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar {{to turn into a}} fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the F-5 on Big Show, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening. On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the No. 29 entry, the second to last competitor to enter the match. He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World's Greatest Tag Team, which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin, who were mentored by Angle. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XIX. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin at No Way Out on February 23. During the match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar botched a shooting star press, a move he had done numerous times in developmental matches, and jammed his head and neck. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match – a pinfall by Lesnar that allowed him to win his second WWE Championship. Lesnar was diagnosed with a concussion from the botched shooting star press.|$|E

25|$|In the Dunjonmaster program, {{the screen}} is divided into a {{birds-eye}} view representation of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons. Temple of Apshai uses a hybrid between a turn-based and a real time combat system. A player's turn {{can be used to}} walk up to 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> the monster out of the fight, or executing a number of different attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn't make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervalls regardless. All actions decrease the player character's fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting. The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics.|$|E

Marlena is later <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> down a suicidal jumper when she falls from a window ledge. Marlena lays in a coma, near death for a month. When she finally recovers, she and Roman renewed their vows on August 22, 1986. In his years with the ISA, Roman worked with a man named Orpheus. Roman accidentally killed Orpheus' wife while on assignment. To get back at Roman, Orpheus kidnaps Marlena and fakes her death. Roman shoots and kills Orpheus, but before he could rescue Marlena, she is presumed to have been killed in a plane crash.|$|E
25|$|The main feud on the SmackDown brand {{was between}} Brock Lesnar and The Big Show over the WWE Championship. Lesnar won the title three months prior at SummerSlam by {{defeating}} then-champion The Rock. Two months later at No Mercy, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match {{to retain the}} title, pinning him after an F-5. On the October 24 edition of SmackDown, after claiming nobody on SmackDown could defeat him, Big Show was traded to SmackDown, immediately issuing a challenge to WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, who accepted later that night. Later that night, after Lesnar and Undertaker cut promos to one another, the Big Show threw Undertaker off the stage, thus injuring his neck. The next week on SmackDown!, Lesnar faced off against Rey Mysterio, which ended in a no contest after Big Show interfered and tossed Mysterio into the crowd. Shortly after the match ended, Big Show slammed Lesnar through the announce table. On the November 8 edition of SmackDown, after Lesnar defeated Eddie Guerrero in a non-title match, Big Show attacked Lesnar and slammed him off the stage. The following week on SmackDown, Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him out of defending the title. Lesnar refused and decided to challenge The Big Show to the ring. As Big Show came out, Lesnar drove him through the Steel steps. Moments later, Lesnar took out Big Show with five chair shots then nailed him with the Championship belt, proving a point that Lesnar can beat The Big Show when they face off at Survivor Series.|$|E

In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me about how I should love this whole genre.

500|$|No {{music video}} was filmed for {{promotion}} of [...] "Nothing Fails". Initially {{it was reported}} by Daily Mirror that Madonna planned to shoot the video in Israel with actor Michael Douglas. According to Polly Graham from the newspaper, Warner Bros. executives {{were concerned about the}} singer's safety in Israel, but Madonna was adamant. [...] "Her record bosses are really worried about it. They are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> her around, but she's having none of it. She has told them it makes sense to shoot it in Israel as the Kabbalah originates from there. Madonna is not particularly bothered about her safety and potential risks. She doesn't think it's as bad as it seems." [...] Her then husband Guy Ritchie was also facing difficulty with his project, Revolver, which was rejected by Sony Pictures executives since it contained references to Kabbalah, and they asked Ritchie to re-write the script. Since the video itself would have included symbolism from Kabbalah, Madonna ultimately decided to not film the music video. These reports were later refuted by the artist during an interview with San Francisco radio station Alice 97.3, where she explained that no music video would be shot for the single.|$|E

In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identified Swift's [...] "defining" [...] vocal gesture as [...] "the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy". Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: [...] "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> tough." [...] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously [...] "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's {{learned how to make}} words sound like what they mean." [...] The Hollywood Reporter opines that her live vocals are [...] "fine", but they do not match those of her peers. In 2009, they were also described as [...] "flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt". However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.|$|E

[...] Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine complimented Swift's ability [...] "to write an indelible melody" [...] and praised {{the production of the}} song, writing [...] " [...] showcase(s) Swift's unique knack for matching the overall tone of a melody to the broader themes of a song". He added that [...] "it isn't easy to make a melancholy song like [...] "Back to December" [...] sound catchy at the same time, but that's what Swift does, and it's an impressive trick." [...] Bobby Peacock from Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five and praised Swift's vocal, saying that [...] "it's her best vocal since [...] "Tim McGraw"". He concluded that [...] " [...] feels a little more focused, a little more mature and a little better-sung than her previous material." [...] The Oxonian Review considers it the centerpiece of the melancholic album, noting how [...] "equating regret with December is a mainstream American musical tradition" [...] and this song is [...] "the congruence of her singing and songwriting at its finest." ...|$|E
