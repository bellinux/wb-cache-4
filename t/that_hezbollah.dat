Omar Sawaidwere – were {{abducted by}} Hezbollah while patrolling the Israeli {{side of the}} Israeli-Lebanese border. The soldiers were killed either during the attack or in its immediate aftermath. Israel Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz has, however, said <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> abducted the soldiers and then killed them.

5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{responded with}} airstrikes and {{artillery}} fire on targets in Lebanon that damaged Lebanese infrastructure, including Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport (which Israel said <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> used to import weapons and supplies), an air and naval blockade, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah then launched more rockets into northern Israel and engaged the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in guerrilla warfare from hardened positions. The war continued until 14 August 2006. Hezbollah {{was responsible for}} thousands of Katyusha rocket attacks against Israeli civilian towns and cities in northern Israel, which Hezbollah said were in retaliation for Israel's killing of civilians and targeting Lebanese infrastructure. The conflict {{is believed to have}} killed 1,191–1,300 Lebanese citizens including combatants and 165 Israelis including soldiers.|$|E

5000|$|The US Congressional Research Service found <b>that</b> {{although}} <b>Hezbollah's</b> {{military capabilities}} {{may have been}} substantially reduced, its long-term potential as a guerrilla movement appeared to remain intact: [...] "Observers note <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> leaders {{have been able to}} claim a level of 'victory' simply by virtue of not having decisively 'lost'." ...|$|R
50|$|Hezbollah {{reported}} losing 7 {{fighters in}} the battle. The official Israeli account stated <b>that</b> 13 <b>Hezbollah</b> fighters were counted killed. General Udi Adam claimed <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah's</b> death toll {{was in fact}} higher, but could not be fully counted because he had ordered his soldiers not to risk their lives to recover enemy dead. An Israeli officer {{who took part in}} the battle estimated that at least 30 Hezbollah fighters were killed.|$|R
5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|A July 2006 USA Today/Gallup {{poll found}} that 83% of the 1,005 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the 2006 Lebanon War, {{compared}} to 66% who blamed Israel to some degree. Additionally, 76% disapproved of the military action Hezbollah took in Israel, compared to 38% who disapproved of Israel's military action in Lebanon. A poll in August 2006 by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 68% of the 1,002 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the civilian casualties in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War, compared to 31% who blamed Israel to some degree. Another August 2006 poll by CNN showed that 69% of the 1,047 Americans polled believed <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> is unfriendly towards, or an enemy of, the United States.|$|E
5|$|Money {{comes from}} Lebanese {{business}} groups, private persons, businessmen, the Lebanese diaspora involved in African diamond exploration, other Islamic groups and countries, and the taxes {{paid by the}} Shia Lebanese. Hezbollah says that {{the main source of}} its income comes from its own investment portfolios and donations by Muslims, however, Western sources maintain <b>that</b> <b>Hezbollah</b> actually receives most of its financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran and Syria. Iran is said to have given $400 million between 1983 and 1989 through donation. The situation has been changed due to economic problems, but Iran still funds humanitarian actions carried on by Hezbollah. According to reports released in February 2010, Hezbollah received $400million from Iran. The US estimates that Iran has been giving Hezbollah about US$60–100million per year in financial assistance. Other estimates are as high as $200-million annually. In 2011 Iran earmarked $7 million to Hezbollah’s activities in the region.|$|E
