5|$|Rutherford {{expanded}} his means of spreading the Watch Tower message in 1924 with {{the start of}} 15-minute radio broadcasts, initially from WBBR, based on Staten Island, and eventually via a network {{of as many as}} 480 radio stations. A 1931 <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> broadcast throughout North America, Australia and France, but his attacks on the clergy resulted in both the NBC and BBC radio networks banning his broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Talk</b> <b>was</b> also abuzz {{throughout}} Singapore of the Komagata Maru {{incident in}} which Canadian authorities refused to allow a ship with 376 Indian passengers to land and forced them to stay aboard for 2 months in difficult conditions. On its way back to India, while the ship docked in Singapore, the governor-general of Singapore remarked that “though the ship had no communication with the land, yet it left a bad effect” on the Indian troops stationed there. Clearly, information was reaching the sepoys through {{a wide range of}} channels many originating as far as North America, Britain, the Ottoman Empire and India. Much of this information was obtained locally, but even so it was being mediated through a host of international and external actors, including a wide array of Indians from across the subcontinent, British officers and Arab and Malay coreligionists.|$|E
5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E

25|$|When John Lossing Buck {{took the}} family to Ithaca the next year, Pearl {{accepted}} an invitation to address a luncheon of Presbyterian women at the Astor Hotel in New York City. Her <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> titled “Is There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?” and her answer was a barely qualified “no”. She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant {{in their attempts to}} control it. When the <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> published in Harper's magazine, the scandalized reaction led Pearl to resign her position with the Presbyterian Board. In 1934, Pearl left China, believing she would return, while John Lossing Buck remained.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{the temple}} {{broadcast}} a talk of Luang Por Dhammajayo {{about what happened}} to Steve Jobs after his death. The talk came as a response to a software engineer of Apple who had sent a letter with questions to the abbot. Luang Por Dhammajayo described how Steve Jobs looked like in heaven. He said that Jobs had been reborn as a deva living close to his former offices, {{as a result of the}} karma of having given knowledge to people. The <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> much criticized, and the abbot was accused of pretending to have attained an advanced meditative state and of attempting to outshine other temples. The temple stated that the <b>talk</b> <b>was</b> meant to illustrate the law of karma, not to defame Jobs, nor to fake an advanced state.|$|E
