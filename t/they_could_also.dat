5|$|All this {{economic}} power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, {{were subject to}} the state corvée system, which conscripted labor for royal projects. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. Harkhuf's trading expedition in the Old Kingdom was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished, and the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at Deir el-Medina. Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 3634 b (commonly {{shortened}} to GJ 3634 b) is a super-Earth exoplanet in {{the orbit}} of the nearby red dwarf Gliese 3634 at approximately 64.5 light-years in constellation Hydra. The planet is approximately eight times the mass of Earth, and orbits its star every {{two and a half}} days at a distance of 0.0287 AU. The planet was the first to be discovered by a group of astronomers searching for exoplanets in {{the orbit of}} very-low-mass stars after the team reorganized their strategy, choosing to search for targets that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> confirm using the transit method. However, a transit event associated with Gliese 3634 b was not detected. The planet's discovery was published in Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{working with}} Dr. Theodore Wadsworth, Todd gained {{permission}} {{to start a}} hospital near the present-day Farmington/Plainville border for smallpox inoculation. The facility, commonly called Hospital Rock, is found deep in the second-growth hardwood forest of Rattlesnake Mountain in Connecticut and was used from 1792-1794.

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of more defensible forts are evident: they could act as temporary refuges for overwhelmed local troops during barbarian incursions, while they waited for reinforcements. The forts were difficult for the barbarians to take by assault, as they generally lacked the necessary equipment. The forts could store sufficient supplies to enable the defenders to hold {{out for a few}} weeks, and to supply relieving troops. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> act as bases from which defenders could make sorties against isolated groups of barbarians and to cooperate with relieving forces.|$|E
5|$|The Act was unusual, {{as it was}} {{obtained}} without Pyott's consent, and created {{a new group of}} commissioners from local justices and dignitaries. They were empowered to set the rates for tolls, and the owner was obliged to transport all goods at the established rates. If there were not sufficient boats and the owner did not provide more, they could license others to provide carriage services. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> order that locks, wharves and warehouses should be erected. The size of boats was specified, and were to be capable of carrying between 20 and 30 tons of cargo. The tolls set were quite moderate, and a group of merchants appear to have leased the river from Pyott for a period after 1767, but he eventually took control again.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Wijdefjorden {{was first used}} by Russian, and later Norwegian, trappers. The cabin at Krosspynten was erected in 1910, {{and two years later}} the cabin at Purpurdalen was built. Trappers {{considered}} the area to have few polar bears but much fox; <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> supplement the catch with common eider. In 1928, a season of trapping gave about 50 Arctic foxes. In 1932, the area's special vegetation was protected, which was assimilated into the national park when it was created. Since the 1980s, trapping has again been taken up, and the Governor of Svalbard has one cabin at Austfjordnes that can be rented for a season of trapping. Of the larger fjords on Svalbard, Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, the Manhattan District became {{responsible}} for collecting military intelligence on Axis atomic research. Groves created [...] Operation Alsos, special intelligence teams {{that would follow}} {{in the wake of}} the advancing armies, rounding up enemy scientists and collecting what technical information and technology <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> <b>Alsos</b> teams ultimately operated in Italy, France and Germany. The security system resembled that of other engineer districts. The Manhattan District organized its own counterintelligence which gradually grew in size and scope, but strict security measures failed to prevent the Soviets from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.|$|R

5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by cutting out the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.|$|E
5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
5000|$|Isoneuromyia semirufa is a Palearctic [...] {{species of}} 'fungus gnat' {{in the family}} Mycetophilidae.

25|$|Both the Russian and Swedish navies {{were based}} on a form of conscription, and both navies used conscripts as galley rowers. This had several {{advantages}} over convicts or slaves: the rowers could be armed to fight as marines, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>also</b> used as land soldiers and invasion force, and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be taught better and more skilled than convicts or slaves. Since most naval conscripts came from coastal parishes and towns, most were already experienced seafarers when they entered the service.|$|R
60|$|Something {{suddenly}} ceased, {{leaving them}} in dizzying uncertainty. For {{the moment it}} was hard to realize there was no wind. With the absolute abruptness of a sword slash, the wind had been chopped off. The schooner rolled and plunged, fetching up on her anchors with a crash which for the first time <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hear. <b>Also,</b> for the first time <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hear the water washing about on deck.

5|$|By mid-1944, the {{squadron}} had expanded its operations to New Guinea, making courier flights to Merauke initially, and later Wewak, Noemfoor and Hollandia. It transferred to Essendon, Victoria, on 1September. The unit was {{now one of}} eight Australian transport squadrons, all of which operated {{under the control of}} RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Their primary duty was supporting the Australian military, though <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be released for urgent requests by General Douglas MacArthur's South West Pacific Area headquarters. A Lodestar crashed and burned on takeoff at Merauke on 26January 1945 but all aboard escaped injury; it was the only hull loss suffered by the type in Australian service. No.37 Squadron received its first three Douglas C-47Dakotas the following month, {{and by the end of}} March had a complement of eighteen aircraft: nine Dakotas, seven Lodestars, a Douglas DC-2, and a deHavilland Tiger Moth. The next month it began operating detachments out of Parafield, South Australia, and Morotai in the Dutch East Indies. On 6July 1945, one of {{the squadron}}'s Dakotas transported the body of Prime Minister John Curtin from Canberra to Perth for burial. By September 1945, No.37 Squadron's strength was 357 staff, including 111 officers, sixteen Dakotas, two Lodestars, a DC-2, and a Tiger Moth.|$|E
5|$|Following {{improvements}} to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was recalled in 1790, when he surveyed it below Midhurst. In the same year, {{the construction of the}} Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an Act of Parliament which would enable him to improve the Rother. The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges for using the navigation were low, as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.|$|E
5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because {{she did not want to}} surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E

25|$|In {{a display}} of foresight, Disney had filmed many of its earlier shows in color so {{they were able to}} be {{repeated}} on NBC, and since most of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> now <b>also</b> be telecast in that format. To emphasize the new feature, the series was re-dubbed Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, which premiered in September 1961, and retained that moniker until 1969.|$|R
5|$|Lowland Scotland {{was part}} of the pattern of late {{marriage}} {{for both men and women}} (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower and more closely resembled Gaelic Ireland. Throughout the period, women could legally marry from the age of 12 and boys from 14. However, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> act as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex {{had made}} {{researchers}} at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not {{taking advantage of the}} latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be taken with the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.|$|E
5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
