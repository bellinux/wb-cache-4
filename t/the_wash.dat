5|$|The SSSI is a long, {{narrow strip}} of coast that starts at the eastern {{boundary}} of <b>The</b> <b>Wash</b> between Old Hunstanton and Holme-next-the-Sea, and runs east for about 43km (27mi) to Kelling. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the A149 coast road.|$|E

5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism {{is that some}} artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie <b>The</b> <b>Wash,</b> featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.|$|E
5|$|The Witham {{originally}} {{flowed into}} <b>The</b> <b>Wash</b> at Bicker Haven, where {{the port of}} Drayton {{was established in the}} Welland estuary, and it was only as a result of massive flooding in 1014 that it diverted itself to flow into The Haven at Boston. This gave rise to the growth of Boston as a port in the 12th and 13thcenturies, exporting wool and salt to the Hanseatic League, though Boston only received its charter in 1545.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 12 March 1940. In April 1940 the squadron flew as escort for a De Havilland Flamingo carrying Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to Paris to attend a meeting after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Most of the unit's time during the Phoney War was consumed engaging in intensive training over <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> which included co-operation with searchlights and mine-laying operations. It did not last for long. On 15 May 1940, 604 relocated to RAF Manston. From the airfield Cunningham flew sorties over the English Channel and patrols over Dunkirk as the Battle for France intensified. Cunningham made no recorded contact with the enemy and France capitulated on 25 June 1940.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} used as a morale-booster during the war, {{particularly}} up to and during the Battle of France.

30|$|For <b>the</b> decontamination, <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> robot first {{measured}} the unevenness {{of the ground}} using the laser range finder. Specifically, when the x-axis was set {{toward the front of}} the robot and the z-axis was set in the vertical direction, the robot {{measured the}} two-dimensional unevenness of the ground in the y-z plane. Based on the obtained information, the robot controlled <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> nozzle at a constant velocity in the y-direction, and used the proposed algorithm to control it in the z-direction. By this means, <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> robot moved <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> nozzle relative to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Tom rushes {{into the}} house and hides in the laundry room, putting Tyke inside <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine. But Tom is too late to do anything; just as Tom is pouring some soap flakes into <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine, Spike's arrival stops Tom rattily and Tom takes Tyke out of <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine. Catching on to what had {{happened}} to Tyke (after Tyke lets out a loud sneeze due to the soap flakes), Spike angrily dumps the entire box of soap flakes over Tom's head and then pushes a soap bar into his mouth, before shoving Tom in <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine, slamming its door on him and turning it on. Now, Tom ends up taking a shower around <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine as Spike and Tyke together look on. Both of them are joined by Jerry, who waves at the cat while the cartoon closes.|$|R
5|$|The Witham, {{which was}} {{originally}} tidal up to Lincoln, {{was an important}} navigation in Roman times. Lincoln (Lindum)—the meeting point of Ermine Street, joining London to York, and Fosse Way, leading to Leicester and Bath—was an important Roman fort that became one of only four colonia in Britain. Most important Roman cities were situated near navigable water, which enabled goods to be transported in bulk, but Lincoln did not possess this advantage, and so the Romans constructed the Fossdyke from Lincoln to Torksey on the River Trent, improved the River Witham from Lincoln to <b>The</b> <b>Wash,</b> and built the Car Dyke from Lincoln to the River Cam near Cambridge. The Witham thus gave Lincoln access to the east coast, while the Fossdyke gave access to the Trent and further on to the Humber.|$|E
5|$|The coins of Ælfwald's reign are {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} that were minted in East Anglia. The coinage of silver pennies known as sceattas expanded {{in his time}} and several types are attributed to East Anglian production. Most of them fall into two main groups, known as the 'Q' and 'R' series. Neither group bears a royal name or title and the authority by which they were issued cannot not established. The 'Q' series, which has some Northumbrian affinities, is most densely distributed in western East Anglia, along the Fen edge between <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> and Cambridge. The R series, with bust and standard, derived from earlier Kentish types, is more densely distributed {{in central and eastern}} East Anglia, including the Ipswich area. According to Michael Metcalf, the 'R' series was also East Anglian, being minted at Gipeswic.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of there being no tolls {{for use of}} the river was established by the 1664 act of parliament. This was reversed by the 1794 act, which imposed high tolls, until they were reduced by the provisions of an act of Parliament obtained in 1824. The river is now managed by the Environment Agency between Stamford and just below Fosdyke bridge, and a licence is required to use it. From there to <b>the</b> <b>Wash,</b> it was managed by the Port of Fosdyke Authority, but since they went into administration, the Environment Agency have also managed the section from Fosdyke Bridge to below the Holbeach River.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine, apart from watercourses, laundry was also done in {{communal}} or public washhouses. Camille Paglia and others argue that <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine led to a species of social isolation of women.|$|R

5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and <b>The</b> <b>Wash.</b> Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{section of}} SR 190 begins at Olancha in the Owens Valley, at the {{intersection}} with US 395. The route heads northeast along the southeast side of Owens Lake to the junction with SR 136 southeast of Keeler, where it turns southeast and east around {{the south side of}} the Inyo Mountains. After passing the turnoff to Darwin, SR 190 enters Death Valley National Park and becomes curvier as it heads down into the Panamint Valley. The highway crosses the valley and then turns northeast over Towne Pass and into the northern part of Death Valley at Stovepipe Wells. Within the valley, {{at the intersection}} with North Highway, which leads to Scotty's Castle and Beatty, Nevada, SR 190 turns southeast through Death Valley, which it remains inside until the turnoff to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, near the settlement of Furnace Creek. It leaves the valley to the southeast alongside Furnace Creek Wash, where the highway is usually closed at least once a year by flash floods. SR 190 turns east away from <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> at the turnoff to Dante's View, and soon leaves the park, after which it follows a mostly straight alignment to its end at State Route 127 at Death Valley Junction.|$|E
5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E

5|$|While the {{question}} of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer Odolen Koblic in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> water of heated pitchblende. He proposed the name bohemium for the element, but after being analyzed {{it turned out that the}} sample was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium. The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois, claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.|$|E

25|$|On the north-west corner East Anglia is {{bordered by}} a bay known as <b>The</b> <b>Wash,</b> where owing to {{deposits}} of sediment and land reclamation, the coastline has altered markedly within historical times; several towns {{once on the}} coast of <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> (notably King's Lynn) are now some distance inland. Conversely, over to the east on the coast exposed to the North Sea the coastline is subject to rapid erosion and has shifted inland significantly since historic times.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, the {{recipient}} of <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> and anointing was naked during the ceremony. Beginning in the 20th century, recipients were given a white poncho-like [...] "shield" [...] to wear during <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> and anointing. Since 2005, participants in the LDS Church version of the ritual already come clothed in the temple garment and wear it during <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> and anointing. In the original version of the ceremony, water and oil were applied to {{various parts of the}} body by the officiator as specific blessings related to the body parts were mentioned; since the early-21st century, the water and oil are applied only to the head and the symbolic nature of <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> and anointing is emphasized as the blessings for the body parts are related.|$|R

Its north-eastern boundary is formed by <b>The</b> <b>Wash.</b> Its eastern boundary follows the River Nene inland to Tydd Gote, where it turns to the west, passing near to the villages of Tydd St Mary and Sutton St James. It then turns to the south to include the village of Holbeach Drove and the hamlet of Shepeau Stow, before turning to the north again to Whaplode Drove. From there it turns to the west to reach the New River, which it follows northwards until its junction with the River Welland, which then forms the western boundary back to <b>The</b> <b>Wash.</b>|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{consumer}} goods often incorporate fuzzy systems.
