5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

But you also must kill your {{son-in-law}} Ricimer, lest there be anyone who might betray you. Moreover, I also have sent the patrician Olybrius to you; I wish you to kill him, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> reign, ruling rather than serving others.|$|E

During this, Columbus is startled by the noises of a rat and accidentally shoots at the last {{remaining}} box of Twinkies in the pantry, destroying all the cakes and making them inedible. Luckily, Little Rock has gotten a Twinkie beforehand and gives it to Tallahassee. The movie ends with the group leaving Pacific Playland as Columbus realizes without relating to other people, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well be a zombie, and that he now has what he's always wanted: a family.|$|E

She later noted, [...] "I remember Billy Drago was awesome–he looked so creepy after makeup. I just wanted this guy to look super-creepy and disturbing to look at, but real enough <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be scared if you looked out your window at night and saw him standing there".|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, a {{video of}} Robyn and Diplo working on [...] "Dancehall Queen" [...] in the studio was posted onto YouTube. The song {{originally}} leaked onto the Internet in February 2010, under the title [...] "No Hassle". In an interview with music website Stereogum, Robyn spoke of the song's origin, saying; [...] "We [...] were talking about Ace of Base {{and we were just}} having fun with that kind of genre music. And the idea of making this song came out of that discussion. It was fun. We really connected on something where music <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> put in one box becomes something else, depending on how you look at it."

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} game's release, IGN posted {{a review of}} the game, citing {{numerous}} bugs and crashes in the PlayStation 3 release. The game also contained a bug, causing the game to freeze and the screen to blur when friends signed out of and into the PlayStation Network. The IGN review was edited shortly thereafter, removing all references to the PS3 version's bugs, causing controversy in the PlayStation communities. Reviewing PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, Digital Chumps and Spawn Kill confirmed that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, along with other bugs, requiring a restart of the game. Even IGN retroactively cited bugs with the original release as well as the Game of the Year edition, calling it [...] "a fantastic game", but warned players to [...] "be aware <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have to deal with some crashes and bugs".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "one {{of the best}} police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of {{performances}} and often startling action", {{and went on to}} name the film the fourth best of 2012. Film critic James Berardinelli described End of Watch as [...] "satisfying and emotionally potent ... a good, gritty drama of the sort that seems increasingly rare within the thriller genre", giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. Olly Richards, writing for Empire, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and summarized it as [...] "a collection of cop-movie clichés but presented with sufficient flair and strong performances that the ride is enough, even if its on rails". While New York Bilge Ebiri found the film largely unrealistic and Ayer's direction [...] "serviceable at best", he wrote that [...] "Ayer and his cast appear to have so convincingly nailed the way these characters talk and act <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not even notice the film slipping from workaday grit into out-and-out myth." ...|$|E
500|$|Roman {{religion}} was practical and contractual, {{based on the}} principle of do ut des, [...] "I give <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> give." [...] Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation {{on the nature of the}} divine and its relation to human affairs. For ordinary Romans, {{religion was}} a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. Apuleius (2nd century) described the everyday quality of religion in observing how people who passed a cult place might make a vow or a fruit offering, or merely sit for a while. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to religious festivals and games (ludi). Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the review}} {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup, issue #0 received an average score of 7.3/10 based on 23 reviews from critics. Leia Calderon of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave it four-out-of-five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Bendis and Coipel's Civil War II #0 serves {{the sole purpose}} of laying out the foundation for the series. Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But {{the good news is that}} this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E
500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

"And if {{you have}} reason to fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not act equitably towards orphans, then marry from among [...] women such as are lawful to you - [...] two, or three, or four: but {{if you have}} reason to fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not be able to treat them with equal fairness, then [...] one - or [...] those whom you {{rightfully}} possess.

2500|$|The {{imprecision}} of {{the targeting}} {{is demonstrated by}} {{the inability of the}} Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included [...] "a great number of organizations <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black." [...] Thus, the nonviolent Southern Christian Leadership Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-"Hate Group." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his infamous essay attacking detective fiction, Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd, American critic Edmund Wilson decried {{this novel}} as dull, overlong {{and far too}} detailed; {{describing}} how he skipped {{a lot of the}} prose about bell-ringing ("a lot of information of the kind <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect to find in an encyclopaedia article on campanology"), and also large amounts of Sayers' focal sleuth character, [...] "the embarrassingly named" [...] Lord Peter Wimsey.|$|E
2500|$|To {{help promote}} the album, Hogan {{appeared}} in the November 2006 edition of FHM, becoming the first FHM cover model under 21 years old. As a result, the November issue had no liquor advertising.
