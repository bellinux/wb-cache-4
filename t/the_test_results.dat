5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{maiden flight}} in March 1958, {{evaluation}} of the RP-77D by the U.S. Army took place throughout the remainder of that year, nearly 40 test flights being conducted. Although <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> were generally satisfactory, {{it was determined that}} the performance of the aircraft was an insufficient improvement over existing types in service to have the aircraft ordered into production, and the project was cancelled, along with the improved RP-86, a dedicated reconnaissance variant.|$|E

5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, the New York Daily News {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but the New York Daily News leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E

Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, Fassl notices a mysterious Bearded Man. After being released, {{he stays in}} a room belonging to his lawyer, Jana Fain, where he clutches a Rosary beads and prays frantically. When the Bearded Man appears, Fassl begs for the man not to hurt her. While Fain is unharmed, Fassl learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, has gone missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood, and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened.|$|E

5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters). This began the phase 1 of the competition. Each company built prototype helicopters {{and went through}} a flight test program. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975. After evaluating <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A in 1976. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage tolerant four-blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; {{they hear}} there's a $10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide {{to enter the}} {{competition}} with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's go-cart and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the $3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely angry after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a $3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> which is where Kenny comes back to life. When {{he is about to}} reveal the identity of Cartman's father, a narrator states that the answer will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} three {{potential}} {{problems associated with}} the validity of personal genome kits. The first issue is the test's validity.

The third problem is the clinical utility of personal genome kits and associated risks, and the benefits of introducing them into clinical practices.|$|E
