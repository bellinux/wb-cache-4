5|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} plaza {{is located}} {{along the beach}} {{next to one of}} Wicked Twister's towers. A sculpture with <b>the</b> <b>GateKeeper</b> logo is {{in the center of the}} plaza. The queue runs parallel to the beach, under the lift hill and station. Once under the station, riders can choose which side of the train they would like to ride. GateKeeper uses the Fast Lane queuing system; visitors can buy a wristband that allows them to wait in a shorter line.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with <b>the</b> <b>Gatekeeper</b> explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
5|$|Forrest's widow, Christine (Katharine Hepburn), {{refuses to}} speak to reporters {{throughout}} the proceedings. However, O'Malley befriends youngster Jeb (Darryl Hickman), son of <b>the</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> of the Forrest estate, Jason Rickards (Howard Da Silva). The grief-stricken boy shows him a way into the mansion, where he meets Christine. Though she is cordial enough, she refuses any cooperation with his biography. After O'Malley leaves, Forrest's private secretary, Clive Kerndon (Richard Whorf), fearful of how the reporter will react to the brushoff, convinces Christine to offer her help {{so that they can}} steer him in the direction they want.|$|E
50|$|Two {{children}} are selected as <b>the</b> <b>gatekeepers</b> (or <b>the</b> gate itself). They hold their {{both hands to}} form an arch so the other players can pass under it. Children start to sing the song as they pass through the gate one by one in a row. When the song ends, the gates are closed as <b>the</b> <b>gatekeepers</b> lower their hands and catch the child who was passing through the gate. The caught child becomes <b>the</b> new <b>gatekeeper.</b> Players can play another round to select <b>the</b> second <b>gatekeeper,</b> or they can replace <b>the</b> <b>gatekeepers</b> one by one after each turn of the game.|$|R

Despite being a relatively young team, <b>the</b> <b>GateKeepers</b> were undefeated in the tournament. Notably, <b>the</b> <b>GateKeepers</b> beat <b>the</b> high-ranking Puget Sound Outcasts and broke the 24-game winning streak of the previously undefeated New York Shock Exchange.|$|R
5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi {{had a profound}} impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. <b>The</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took <b>the</b> <b>gatekeeper,</b> who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is <b>the</b> <b>Gatekeeper,</b> whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>gatekeeper</b> in <b>the</b> new 1887 Victorian cottage was Mrs Bridget Reilly (often misspelt Riley), who {{had been}} {{recently}} widowed. It was not unusual for the Parramatta Park Trust to appoint ladies to this role, as the Sands Directory for 1905 shows that three of <b>the</b> <b>gatekeepers</b> in <b>the</b> park were women. The duties of <b>the</b> <b>gatekeepers</b> were to open the gates {{in the morning and}} close them at dusk. They were also responsible for keeping within the park the cows and horses for whom the park trust received adjustment fees. There were sometimes disagreements about this duty, which were described in a newspaper. <b>The</b> <b>gatekeepers</b> also provided hot water at a small charge to picnickers who wished to make some tea.|$|R

5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and <b>the</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
5|$|North of the gatehouse, {{located at}} 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in Victorian style, in {{contrast}} to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of <b>the</b> <b>gatekeeper,</b> located {{on the north side of}} the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one {{at either end of the}} passage, and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal projections on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed <b>the</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E

25|$|Little else {{is known}} of Jane's early life until {{she and her father}} appear in a record of 1786 (she then aged about 35). They {{travelled}} home on horseback along a turnpike road and on arriving at the turnpike gate at West Rainton, argued with <b>the</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> that they had no need to pay the toll, having already passed through it that same morning. Mathew and Jane then rode off. Knowing their story to be untrue, <b>the</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> brought action against them, and the court found they had been in Barnard Castle (25 miles away) for several days.
