5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each {{had a number of}} tickets which they could give to <b>those</b> people who they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were <b>those</b> unable to work during the winter months. <b>Those</b> individuals classed as undeserving were <b>those</b> whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the fully aquatic Archegosaurus shows that it's heat balance, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and {{digestion}} were more similar to <b>those</b> of fish than <b>those</b> of modern aquatic amphibians like salamanders.|$|E
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than <b>those</b> in Scholastic, and <b>those</b> in Scholastic are typically lower than <b>those</b> in Honors.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: <b>those</b> that should be kept active (first-class), <b>those</b> that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and <b>those</b> that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Corcoran fell into the third-class category.|$|E

5|$|All Lebanese {{citizens}} habitually {{resident in}} the Republic of Lebanon and aged 15 or above are obliged by the Lebanese law {{to apply for}} a Lebanese Identity Card, whilst it is optional for <b>those</b> under 15 or <b>those</b> who are residing abroad.|$|E
5|$|All <b>those</b> with {{a risk of}} {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already. Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given to <b>those</b> who are not sufficiently immunized. In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among <b>those</b> with a normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of heavy rainfall in Worcestershire in July 2007 the M5 motorway was blocked, leaving many stranded cars on the road. The operations manager of the service station, Quintin Speers provided {{a key role in}} helping <b>those</b> stranded, opening up areas of the main building to be used by <b>those</b> stuck on the motorway. Quintin Speers also helped drivers by pushing cars to safety and distributing blankets to <b>those</b> in need.|$|E
5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} like <b>those</b> of grasshoppers. The mandibles {{appear as}} large pincers {{on the front}} of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with <b>those</b> of the males enlarged enormously compared with <b>those</b> of females of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth forms {{trivalent}} and pentavalent compounds, the trivalent ones {{being more}} common. Many of its chemical properties {{are similar to}} <b>those</b> of arsenic and antimony, although they are less toxic than derivatives of <b>those</b> lighter elements.|$|E
5|$|Boris and Zeanah (1999), {{have offered}} an {{approach}} to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, <b>those</b> {{where there is a}} distorted relationship, and <b>those</b> where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because <b>those</b> definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a specified attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|By that time, {{the land}} once held in common by the Székely {{community}} had gradually become divided into {{smaller and smaller}} units; thus {{a vast number of}} the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter <b>those</b> who performed mounted military service were differentiated from <b>those</b> who fought as foot-soldiers; <b>those</b> who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.|$|E
5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, <b>those</b> {{involved in the}} New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers {{are involved in the}} milieu varied considerably, from <b>those</b> who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to <b>those</b> who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E
5|$|Components for the Project 26bis2 {{ships were}} {{manufactured}} in the West (Ordzhonikidze built <b>those</b> for Kalinin and Marti <b>those</b> for Kaganovich) and shipped to Komsomolsk-on-Amur for assembly. They were launched from drydocks and towed incomplete to Vladivostok for fitting-out.|$|E
5|$|Computers {{used in the}} {{development}} of the film were four times faster than <b>those</b> used in The Incredibles and 1,000 times faster than <b>those</b> used in Toy Story. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to <b>those</b> used in the design of real-world automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in <b>those</b> who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in <b>those</b> with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in <b>those</b> with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Drug therapies for <b>those</b> with cardiac {{abnormalities}}, as <b>those</b> abnormalities become {{severe enough}} to warrant {{the use of these}} therapies. ECG's are mandatory prior to any surgical interventions, due to possible arrythmia.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} OS and SSD are {{configured}} {{to support the}} TRIM command, other conditions might prevent any benefit from TRIM. , databases and RAID systems are not yet TRIM-aware and consequently will {{not know how to}} pass that information on to the SSD. In <b>those</b> cases the SSD will continue to save and garbage collect <b>those</b> blocks until the OS uses <b>those</b> LBAs for new writes.|$|E
5|$|For {{older people}} with chronic pain, opioids {{may be used}} in <b>those</b> for whom NSAIDs present too great a risk, {{including}} <b>those</b> with diabetes, stomach or heart problems. They may also be useful for a select group of people with neuropathic pain.|$|E

5|$|Having {{completed}} <b>those</b> chapters which analyse {{the relevant}} aspects {{of power in}} social life, Russell shifts his focus onto the philosophical issues that are connected with <b>those</b> problems. Moving into this new terrain, he wonders {{what can be done}} to curb the efforts of <b>those</b> who love power. The answers can be found either in possible collective actions, or in individual duties.|$|E
5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all <b>those</b> I had been afraid of, all <b>those</b> I once could have laughed at, all <b>those</b> I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in <b>those</b> with blood in the stool, <b>those</b> {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and <b>those</b> who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and <b>those</b> with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|I {{really wanted}} {{to sit down with}} Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of <b>those</b> songs, one of <b>those</b> tracks and one of <b>those</b> videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, at Walter Sickert's invitation, {{she became}} a member and {{exhibited}} paintings she made at the Fitzroy Street Group. She also purchased the works of other artists. She {{was one of the}} artists that founded the London Group. According to author Kate Deepwell, her works, and <b>those</b> of Vanessa Bell and other women, were evaluated differently at that time than <b>those</b> made by men: The best critique of woman's work at the time would be that they had individuality, but they would not have been considered innovative, modern works like <b>those</b> made by men.|$|E
5|$|In Gallup polls of January 1954, 50% of <b>those</b> polled had a {{positive}} opinion of McCarthy. In June, that number had fallen to 34%. In the same polls, <b>those</b> with a negative opinion of McCarthy increased from 29% to 45%.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, <b>those</b> who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, <b>those</b> who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, <b>those</b> with an abnormal thyroid examination, <b>those</b> with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and <b>those</b> with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in <b>those</b> with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, {{most of the time}} they have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of <b>those</b> with Down syndrome and 90% of <b>those</b> with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, the viewership {{figures were}} {{in line with}} <b>those</b> {{obtained}} on the previous week, with around 510,000 viewers. <b>Those</b> figures are in the top end for the network, Sky Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{resistance}} to power can take two diametrically opposed forms: <b>those</b> which indulge {{the impulse to}} power, and <b>those</b> who seek to quell the impulse to power entirely.|$|E

5|$|Khutors are {{a smaller}} type of rural locality. Typically, <b>those</b> that {{appeared}} before 1900 were established by landowners, while <b>those</b> created {{during the first}} half of the 20th century encompassed public land.|$|E

5|$|Loring {{also was}} built with a non-denominational chapel, which helped to welcome new members onto the base. Services were offered to <b>those</b> of the Roman Catholic, Protestant denominations, and Judaic faiths. Members {{of the chapel}} also {{provided}} food for <b>those</b> who ate in Loring's dining hall, and helped to share the word of God to <b>those</b> who were believers.|$|E
5|$|Many English villages {{were given}} their shape in this period, {{and almost all}} are {{described}} in some detail in the eleventh century Domesday Book. Hoskins identifies three major types of village: <b>those</b> around a green or central square, as at Finchingfield in Essex; <b>those</b> along a single street, like Henley in Arden in Warwickshire; and <b>those</b> consisting of apparently haphazardly scattered dwellings, like Middle Barton near Hoskins's home in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between <b>those</b> of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than <b>those</b> of neodymium and lower than <b>those</b> of samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than <b>those</b> of samarium and less <b>those</b> of neodymium.|$|E
