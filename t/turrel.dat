'The Open Sea' was a vast structure with a layered interior and penetrated by patterns and sculptural forms. [...] "Considered as a structure, comparison can be made with the architecture {{at the edge of the}} sea such as boardwalks and the traditional English Pier, and also with the fantastic structures of the fairground".

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to his father's inspirations, young Mario was influenced by Mexican Modern Architects such as Luis Barragán, Max Cetto, and Mario Pani. In terms of landscape design, Schjetnan was drawn towards the works of Luis Barragán, Roberto Burle Marx and Lawrence Halprin. He was also interested in the revolution and work of leftist artists such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and Juan O'Gorman. Shortly after his graduation from UNAM, the events surrounding May 1968 in Paris and the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City inspired Shjetnan to design for social needs at the INFONAVIT (Mexico's federal institute for workers' housing). Now with over 40 {{years of experience in}} his firm, [...] "ecology is increasingly becoming the organizing principle of his work." [...] He is now inspired by architects such as Renzo Piano, Tadao Ando and Norman Foster in addition to environmental artists such as Doug Hollis, Richard Long, and James <b>Turrel.</b>|$|E

[...] The flooring is made of sinker pine which was salvaged from the Trinity River and cut specifically for the meeting house. Its long submersion has given the wood a greenish tint.

40|$|That nurses should {{base their}} {{practice}} on the best available knowledge is generally accepted by the profession. However, the operationalisation of this ideal is difficult for hard pressed clinicians. We believe that responsibility for assimilating current knowledge in a practical format belongs to all nurses working in an organisation. This paper describes a project where clinicians, administrators and academics have collaborated to rewrite standards of practice in a format that includes up to date evidence and practical measures for appraising outcomes. This work is a practical example of quality assurance activities serving to create opportunities for collaboration between nurses who have chosen to practice, teach, manage and/or research nursing.

Two large shacks stand {{to the right of the}} image, at a right angle to each other, their walls in disrepair. The smaller of the two shacks stands lengthwise, an adobe portico extending out from its left side. A short, dilapidated brick wall stands out a little in front of them. Large sand dunes are visible in the distance and dry, rocky ground is visible in the foreground. Picture file card reads: "Watkins photo, copied by Chas. B. <b>Turrel.</b> Behind the mountains at right lies the city of San Diego. ". "Turrel" likely should be spelled "Turrill", the individual in question likely being Charles Beebe Turrill, a historian and promoter of California who lived from 1854 to 1927...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Individual-level factors {{influence}} DMFT, {{but little}} is known about the influence of community environment. This study examined associations between community-level influences and DMFT among a birth cohort of Indigenous Australians aged 16 – 20 years. METHODS Data were collected as part of Wave 3 of the Aboriginal Birth Cohort study. Fifteen community areas were established and the sample comprised 442 individuals. The outcome variable was mean DMFT with explanatory variables including diet and community disadvantage (access to services, infrastructure and communications). Data were analysed using multilevel regression modelling. RESULTS In a null model, 13. 8 % of the total variance in mean DMFT was between community areas, which increased to 14. 3 % after adjusting for gender, age and diet. Addition of the community disadvantage variable decreased the variance between areas by 4. 8 %, indicating that community disadvantage explained one-third of the area-level variance. Residents of under-resourced communities had significantly higher mean DMFT (β = 3. 86, 95 % CI 0. 02, 7. 70) after adjusting for gender, age and diet. CONCLUSIONS Living in under-resourced communities was associated with greater DMFT among this disadvantaged population, indicating that policies aiming to reduce oral health-related inequalities among vulnerable groups may benefit from taking into account factors external to individual-level influences.
