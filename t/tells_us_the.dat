5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E

It is not in vain that the Holy Quran <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E
500|$|Numbers {{of ships}} and {{men for the}} Allies are also {{somewhat}} problematic. Herodotus claims that Leotychides had 110 triremes under his command. However, the previous year, the allies had fielded 271 triremes at the Battle of Artemisium, and then 378 at the Battle of Salamis. We are also told that the Allies had [...] "command of the sea" [...] after Salamis, which implies that they could at least equal the Persian fleet. Diodorus, on the other hand, <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> allies had 250 ships, which is more consistent with their force levels of the previous year. These two numbers can be reconciled by assuming that Leotychides had 110 triremes under his command before being joined by Xanthippus and the Athenian ships, after the Allied army had marched out from the Peloponnesus. This is the approach taken by Holland, and gives a naval force which might well match {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E

2500|$|The battle soon got underway. Henry of Huntingdon {{tells us}} that [...] "the Scots cried out the warcry of their fathers - and the shout rose even to the skies - Albanaich, Albanaich!" [...] and charged the massed Anglo-Norman line. The cry, meaning [...] "Men of Scotland", had {{been used by the}} Scots at the battle of Corbridge in 908. Ailred {{described}} the same charge, saying that the first line [...] "after their custom gave vent thrice to a yell of horrible sound, and attacked the southerns in such an onslaught that they compelled the first spearmen to forsake their post; but they were driven off again by the strength of the knights, and [...] recovered their courage and strength against the foe. And when the frailty of the Scottish lances was mocked by the denseness of iron and wood they drew their swords and attempted to contend at close quarters" [...] As the Scots were engaging in this close combat, Ailred {{tells us that}} the English archers began to fire on the Scottish line, causing extreme disarray and lose of life. The suicidal bravery and endurance of the Galwegians, and the lack of Norman-style armour which Máel Ísu and the Scots had allegedly been so boastful of, was mocked by Ailred: [...] "like a hedgehog with its quill, so would you see a Galwegian bristling all round with arrows, and none theless brandishing his sword, and in blind madness rushing forward now smite a foe, now lash the air with useless stokes". [...] Despite this attack, the battle continued. Ailred <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> force of David's son Henry managed to route its opponents. According to Henry of Huntingdon, though, the battle turned when the [...] "chief of the men of Lothian", probably Cospatric II, earl of Dunbar, was struck by an arrow. The men of Lothian apparently fled first; and after a while, Ailred <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> Galwegians followed suit when Domnall and Ulgric, two of their captains, were slain. John of Hexham tells us that the battle lasted three hours.|$|E

Indeed, modern science {{allows one to}} understand the [...] "true literal meaning of the Creation narrative." [...] To Schroeder, it is Einstein's relativity, the [...] "distortion of time facing backwards in a forward rushing cosmos," [...] that accounts for the compression of time in a 15-billion year-old universe into six days of creation. To Schroeder, the emergence of modern man can be dated {{to the beginning of}} writing. Archeologists date the first writing, he notes, [...] "at five or six thousand years ago, the exact period that the Bible <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> soul of Adam, the neshama, was created." [...] To Schroeder, who cites the Targum of Onkelos, Adam was the first man who could write, and the creation of Adam from more primitive man was a divine ensoulment.|$|E

60|$|In one sense, at any rate, {{it is more}} {{valuable}} to read bad literature than good literature. Good literature may tell us the mind of one man; but bad literature may tell us the mind of many men. A good novel <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> truth about its hero; but a bad novel <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> truth about its author. It does much more than that, it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> truth about its readers; and, oddly enough, it tells us this all the more the more cynical and immoral be the motive of its manufacture. The more dishonest a book is as a book the more honest it is as a public document. A sincere novel exhibits the simplicity of one particular man; an insincere novel exhibits the simplicity of mankind. The pedantic decisions and definable readjustments of man {{may be found in}} scrolls and statute books and scriptures; but men's basic assumptions and everlasting energies {{are to be found in}} penny dreadfuls and halfpenny novelettes. Thus a man, like many men of real culture in our day, might learn from good literature nothing except the power to appreciate good literature. But from bad literature he might learn to govern empires and look over the map of mankind.|$|E
