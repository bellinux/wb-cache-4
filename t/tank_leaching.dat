However, the use of IBA as aggregate in CBM required higher cement contents {{to achieve the same}} compressive and tensile strength.

40|$|<b>Tank</b> <b>leaching</b> {{tests were}} carried out to {{investigate}} the behavior of leaching trace elements from monolith samples. This study consists of two series, and the trace element used was hexavalent chromium. In Series I, {{the influence of the}} leachant/surface area of the specimen (L/S ratio) on the leaching amount was investigated. The leaching amount was found to increase with the amount of worked water. This shows that any L/S ratio can be selected in the <b>tank</b> <b>leaching</b> test. In Series II, the influence of the curing conditions of concrete on the leaching amount was investigated. In the case of concrete cured under sealed conditions, hexavalent chromium hardly leached. On the other hand, in the case of concrete dried in the room, the amount of leaching of hexavalent chromium became large. Carbonation was found to cause the decomposition of cement hydrates and the release of fixed hexavalent chromium. The leaching of hexavalent chromium from using concrete was evaluated from these results. When water works continuously against concrete, the leaching of hexavalent chromium hardly affects the environment for water. When rainwater flows on the drying surface of concrete, the amount of leaching at the first rainfall was comparatively large, but deceased with subsequent rainfall...|$|E

It is estimated that at present 49 million persons are served by 15 million individual disposal systems in the United States. The great majority of these systems are septic tank installations. Over the years, efforts {{have been made to}} determine the life span of existing septic tank systems. It was felt that this type of data could be helpful to those responsible for designing and discuss ing construction permits for new installations. It was determined that the most critical part of the septic tank was the leaching area. In those geographical areas studied, the type of soil in which a leaching system was installed greatly affected the life span of the entire system. Existing predictive methods for determining the life span of a septic <b>tank</b> <b>leaching</b> system seem to be inadequate.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop new standards for determining the size of a septic <b>tank</b> <b>leaching</b> system following the study of survival rates of installations in a selected area of Los Angeles County. Three hundred leaching systems installed between the years 1959 and 1965 were evaluated.

Survival rates were composed for systems installed according to the two sets of standards. (see more in text. ...|$|E

The release of substances has to be determined also for materials treated with biocidal products according to the requirements of the European Biocidal Products Regulation. A similar leaching test procedure was already harmonised for treated wood for this purpose. Both test procedures were applied in parallel to wood treated with the same preservative to investigate whether the results of these tests can replace each other. Additional experiments were performed to further investigate unexpected effects of L/A ratio on leaching of copper and duration of storage of treated test specimens.|$|E
50|$|The Sepro Leach Reactor {{is a high}} {{concentration}} leach reactor developed to treat the gold concentrate produced by the Falcon Concentrator. The unit consists of a concentrate holding <b>tank</b> and a <b>leach</b> <b>tank</b> and impeller which are linked by a Sepro vertical bowl pump. The SLR uses either peroxide or oxygen gas to achieve elevated levels of dissolved oxygen required to accelerate the leaching process with no reagents required. The pregnant leach solution produced can be directly electrowon. With the addition of an electrowinning unit the final product becomes a gold plated carbon that can be directly refined to produce gold bullion. Extensive test work of the SLR on site has shown over 99% of the target mineral is recovered through a simple, fully automated process that is easily incorporated into recovery operations. Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies SLR units with capacities ranging from 1000-50,000 kg.|$|R

40|$|Two bottom ashes, one air {{pollution}} control (APC) residue and one fly ash from three different Swedish {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) plants were characterised regarding the leaching of environmentally relevant components. Characterisation was performed using a diffusion <b>tank</b> <b>leaching</b> test. The impact of carbonation on the release of eight critical components, i. e., Cl(-), Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Se, SO(4) (2 -) and Zn, was assessed at a lab-scale and showed carbonation to have a more pronounced demobilising effect on critical components in bottom ashes than in APC residue and fly ash. From grate type incinerator bottom ash, the release of Cr decreased by 97 %, by 63 % for Cu and by 45 % for Sb. In the investigated APC residue, the releases of Cr, Se and Pb were defined as critical, although they either remained unaffected or increased after carbonation.

Kansai, Intron and RIVM agreed upon Kansai partially duplicating the experiments and upon RIVM interpreting and evaluating the results, drawing conclusions, and finally making the report. The effect of geosta A/D was studied by comparing some chemical and physical properties of products containing geosta A/D with reference products without geosta.

Um método desenvolvido é o tratamento pela incorporação dos resíduos em matrizes à base de cimento Portland, que age tanto como barreira física quanto química para os poluentes concentrados no resíduo. A investigação da segurança deste método é feita por meio de ensaios de lixiviação, dentre outros. Um deles é o ensaio de tanque, adequado para amostras monolíticas, {{conforme}} a norma holandesa NEN 7345. O objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar a fixação de metais pesados na matriz cimentícia por meio do ensaio de tanque em amostras previamente contaminadas com os metais Cd, Cr III, Cr VI, Pb e Zn, na concetração de 100 ppm. As amostras analisadas consistiam em argamassas nas quais a cinza pesada (CZP) oriunda de uma usina termelétrica e o agregado reciclado de entulho (RCD) originário de uma unidade de beneficiamento substituíam a areia, em volume. As amostras de referência foram confeccionadas com areia normal IPT, com granulometria similar a CZP e RCD. Foram utilizados dois tipos de cimento: CP I S e CP V ARI. O lixiviante utilizado no ensaio de tanque foi água destilada e deionizada com pH alterado para 4 através da adição de HNO 3. A renovação do lixiviante ocorreu após 6 horas, 1; 2, 25; 4; 9; 16; 36 e 64 dias. A cada renovação, o líquido extraído era filtrado, tinha seu pH e condutividade elétrica medidos e era submetido à análise semiquantitativa de energia dispersiva por raios-X (EDX). Os ensaios evidenciaram que é possível avaliar o potencial de liberação de metais pesados das matrizes cimentícias e estimar o tempo de liberação dos poluentes. A técnica semiquantitativa por EDX demonstrou-se adequada na avaliação da inética de liberação do Cd, Cr III, Cr VI, Pb e Zn. Along {{with the}} increase in the generation of industrial wastes, the concern with their treatment and final disposal has been growing. A developed method is the treatment by the incorporation of wastes into Portland cement based matrices, which acts as a physical barrier as well as a chemical one for the pollutants concentrated in the waste. The investigation of the safety of this method is done through leaching tests, among others. One of them is the <b>tank</b> <b>leach</b> test, adequate for monolithic samples, according to the Dutch standard NEN 7345. The aim of this research was to assess the retention of heavy metals in the cementitious matrix through the tank test in samples previously contaminated with Cd, Cr III, Cr VI, Pb and Zn, at the concentration of 100 ppm. The samples analyzed consisted of mortars in which the bottom ash (CZP, coming from a thermoelectric plant and the recycled aggregates from debris (RCD), coming from a recycling plant, replaced the sand in volume. The reference samples were produced with standard sand IPT, with grain-size composition similar to CZP and RCD. Two types of cement were used: CP I S and CP V ARI. The leachant used for the <b>tank</b> <b>leach</b> test was distilled and deionized water with its pH altered to 4 through the addition of HNO 3. The renewal of the leachant occurred after 6 h, 1; 2, 25; 4; 9; 16; 36 and 64 days. After each renewal, the liquid extracted was filtered, it had its pH and electrical conductivity measured and was submitted to semi-quantitative analyses through Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). The tests showed {{that it is possible to}} assess the potential heavy metals release from the cementitious matrices and to estimate the time of the pollutants release.
