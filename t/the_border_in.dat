5|$|For a {{landscape}} artist, it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little: to Blaricum, Egmond aan Zee, and Rhenen in the 1640s, with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim and Steinfurt just across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> Germany in 1650, and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661, via the Veluwe, Deventer and Ootmarsum.

5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark.

While the 1326 treaty did not define <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E

5|$|Dodd, {{also known}} as Mullawa or Mulla walla (flying fish), was an Arunta or Arrente Indigenous man from central Australia. It is unclear if Dodd was from the Northern Territory or South Australia: one source states {{he was born in}} Alice Springs, and another states he was born at the Hermannsburg Mission, to the town's south-west. However a third source {{suggests}} Oodnadatta, across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>in</b> South Australia, while Dodd himself, in a 2011 interview, stated he was South Australian. A 1953 newspaper report states that he was from Coober Pedy and had been resident at Colebrook Home, which housed Indigenous children from northern South Australia; some residents subsequently identified as members of the Stolen Generation. The only record of a birth date is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs' Nominal Roll of Australian Veterans of the Korean War, which gives 1 June 1928.|$|E
