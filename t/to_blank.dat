25|$|The {{important}} role of language, however, {{is not confined to}} the taming plot. For example, in a psychoanalytic reading of the play, Joel Fineman suggests there is a distinction made between male and female language, further subcategorising the latter into good and bad, epitomised by Bianca and Katherina respectively. Language is also important in relation to the Induction. Here, Sly speaks in prose until he begins to accept his new role as lord, at which point he switches <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> verse and adopts the royal we. Language is also important in relation to Tranio and Lucentio, who appear on stage speaking a highly artificial style of blank verse full of classical and mythological allusions and elaborate metaphors and similes, thus immediately setting them aside from the more straightforward language of the Induction, and alerting the audience {{to the fact that they}} are now in an entirely different milieu.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{predicted that the}} system would have a practical detection range {{on the order of}} , but never managed to stretch this much beyond 3 miles. Much of this was due to the inefficient system being used <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> out the receiver during the transmission pulse, which wasted most of the radio energy. This final piece of the puzzle was provided by Arthur Cooke, who suggested using the Sutton tube filled with a dilute gas as a switch, replacing the spark gap system. During transmission, the power of the magnetron would cause the gas to ionise, presenting an almost perfect radio mirror that would prevent the signal from reaching the output. When the pulse ended the gas would rapidly de-ionise, allowing signals to flow across (or around) the cavity and reach the output. Skinner took up development of the concept with Ward and Starr, initially trying helium and hydrogen, but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon. The resulting design, known as a soft Sutton tube, went into production as the CV43 and the first examples arrived in the summer of 1941.|$|E

500|$|Jane Stanford {{has been}} {{described}} as having a [...] "Victorian aversion <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> space" [...] and so created a church that is [...] "a dimly lit cavern of glowing mosaic surfaces... and vibrant, stained-glass windows". The church is richly decorated throughout, its architectural features carved with formalized foliate ornament, and the walls adorned with mosaics in the Byzantine manner. [...] The stained-glass windows were crafted by J. and R. Lamb of New York. [...] The chandeliers, installed in 1915, are in the Art Nouveau tradition and have gold decorative patterns cast in pot metal.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, {{the private}} Yahoo! Mail account of Sarah Palin, Republican vice presidential {{candidate}} in the 2008 United States presidential election, was hacked by a 4chan user. This followed criticism of Palin and other politicians supposedly using private email accounts for governmental work. The hacker posted the account's password on /b/, and screenshots from within the account to Wikileaks. A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email {{to a friend of}} Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he forgot <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> out the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, in that most reports on the hack focused on 4chan, rather than Palin's violation of campaign law. One user commented, [...] "seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically." [...] The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the incident shortly after its occurrence. On September 20 it was revealed they were questioning David Kernell, the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell.|$|E

40|$|Computers {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of supplying answers to programmed instruction frames. A group experimental design compared passive reading, covert responding <b>to</b> frame <b>blanks,</b> and actively typing answers <b>to</b> <b>blanks</b> with and without immediate confirmation of correctness. Effects of a 315 -frame program, teaching elements of programmed instruction design, were evaluated by analyzing answers to posttest generalization questions and an application test. Results strongly supported the effectiveness of requiring the student to supply fragments of a terminal repertoire while working through a program. Students who could either covertly respond <b>to</b> frame <b>blanks</b> or who were required to type frame answers performed significantly better on the frame generalization posttest and, more importantly, carefully followed program rules when preparing elements of a new instructional program...|$|R

5000|$|In one {{variation}} of Scrabble, blanks actually do score points {{corresponding to the}} letter which the <b>blank</b> is used <b>to</b> represent. For example, if one played <b>blank</b> <b>to</b> represent a [...] "Z", it would get ten; a <b>blank</b> <b>to</b> represent a V or an H would get four; a <b>blank</b> <b>to</b> represent a D would get 2 and <b>blank</b> <b>to</b> represent a T, N, L, S or R {{or any of the}} vowels would get one.|$|R
2500|$|The {{left side}} of the canyon from the {{resurgence}} to the dry valley is riddled with passages breaking out into the canyon walls, forming many of the unusable entrances to the cave. [...] Most of these are small passages exposed as the river cut its way down. [...] The exception [...] is the 25 m wide Great Hall that follows the north – south [...] joint pattern breaking into the canyon at the resurgence. Hidden {{at the end of the}} Great Hall behind boulders is the hard-to-find Chameleon Passage. This runs along the east–west joint pattern. Some small passages lead from Chameleon <b>to</b> <b>Blank</b> Passage and back to the Big Rapids. Several small passages run from Blank Passage to Boulder Chokes.|$|E
2500|$|The World War ended {{a golden}} era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted and male {{replacements}} {{could not be}} found (women were not considered). Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to closely supervise newspapers. [...] A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit: ...|$|E
