As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E

Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E

Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone.

Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing math problems. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, novel tasks, etc.|$|E

The Covadonga area is also rich with astonishing stories, such as the one which is said to have happened in a shepherd village where today Enol and Ercina lakes are situated. Mary, mother of Jesus, disguised as a pilgrim, is said to have visited that village and asked for food and shelter from every house of that village. She was rudely rejected by every person, except for a shepherd who gave her refuge and warmly shared everything he had. On the following day, as punishment for their lack of hospitality, a flood of divine origin devastated the village, which completely covered everything except the cottage of the good shepherd. In front of him, the mysterious guest started <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> <b>and</b> her tears became flowers when they reached the floor. Then the shepherd realized that the pilgrim was actually Mary.|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance.

Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes.

40|$|Two {{colonies of}} Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée), artificially {{selected}} from a Bt-susceptible colony (ACB-BtS) for resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab (ACB-AbR) <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac (ACB-AcR) toxins, were used to analyze inheritance patterns of resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 toxins. ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR evolved significant levels of resistance, with resistance ratios (RR) of 39 -fold and 78. 8 -fold <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, respectively. The susceptibility of ACB-AbR larvae <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 F toxins, which had not previously been exposed, were significantly reduced, being > 113 -fold and 48 -fold, respectively. Similarly, susceptibility of ACB-AcR larvae <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 F were also significantly reduced (RR > nine-fold, RR > 18 -fold, respectively), indicating cross-resistance among Cry 1 Ab, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 F toxins. However, ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR larvae were equally susceptible <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ie as were ACB-BtS larvae, indicating no cross-resistance between <b>Cry</b> 1 Ie <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac toxins; this may provide considerable benefits in preventing or delaying the evolution of resistance in ACB <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac toxins. Backcrossing studies indicated that resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab toxin was polygenic in ACB-AbR, but monogenic in ACB-AcR, whilst resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac toxin was primarily monogenic in both ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR, but polygenic as resistance increased...|$|R

After this, he ordered for his prisoners to be put under guard and to be treated properly. The men were freed in the end, but Hamza and his staff were ransomed for 13,000 ducats. Franco reports that Skanderbeg's magnanimity became known throughout Albania and the Ottoman Empire to the point where many of his men gained much more respect for him as a warrior. Skanderbeg's intention in doing so was to show that he would not take advantage of the unfortunate and that he had enough confidence in his ability to let his enemies fight him again another day.|$|E

[...] "Middle-aged {{men are not}} 'supposed' to cry during movies," [...] stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of Titanic as having generated such tears, adding that [...] "men, if they have felt weepy during , have often tried to be surreptitious about it." [...] Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, [...] "For many men, {{there is a great}} deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> <b>and</b> these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed." [...] Rohrer said, [...] "Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon." [...] For men in general, [...] "the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion".|$|E
