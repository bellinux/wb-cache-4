Working in Malawi, MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about Mexican and Maya cuisine while in Merida, Mexico for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. They make a symbolic journey to Bamfield, within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.|$|E

Here, <b>they</b> <b>cook</b> the food and distribute it to the devotees. There is a common well some 300 meters from the main Pathi. Akilattirattu Ammanai states that all the eighteen castes take baths from that well. It was considered sacred to bathe in and to drink the water from that well. Then there found [...] a Paal Kinaru, in the extreme east, Vatakku Vasal in the north and Sivaye Medai, which is also called Karuda medai in the west of Palliyarai. Then all these were surrounded by outer corridors. There is a bell tower above the spot where Vaikundar performed the Tavam.|$|E

2500|$|Broad beans, or [...] "Baghalee" [...] (Persian: باقالی) are {{primarily}} cultivated {{in the central}} and north parts of Iran. The city of Kashan has the highest production of broad beans with high quality {{in terms of the}} taste, cooking periods and color. However, broad beans have a very short season (roughly two weeks). The season is usually in the middle of spring. When people have access to fresh beans in season, <b>they</b> <b>cook</b> them in brine and then add vinegar and Heracleum persicum depending on taste. They also make an extra amount to dry to be used year round. The dried beans can be cooked with rice, which forms {{one of the most famous}} dishes in north of Iran (Gilan) called baghalee polo (Persian: باقالی پلو) which means [...] "rice with broad beans". In Iran broad beans are cooked, served with Golpar-origan and salt and sold on streets in the winter. This food is also available preserved in metal cans.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the dishes}} cooked by Jewish people of Eastern Europe origin are akin {{to those of the}} nations among whom they dwelled, and in much of Europe (including most of the English-speaking world) is the {{dominant}} style associated with [...] "Jewish cooking"; substitutions were made to accommodate the dietary laws. [...] Hence, dishes which Gentiles make with pork are made with veal or chicken; chicken fat (or, more modernly, hydrogenated vegetable oil such as Crisco) is used in place of lard. Thus the kasha and blintzes of the Russian Jews, the mamaliga of the Romanians, the paprika of the Hungarians, are dishes adopted by the Jews from their gentile neighbors. Only on religious and ceremonial occasions did <b>they</b> <b>cook</b> special Jewish dishes. [...] In the United States, in particular, Jewish cooking (and the cookbooks that recorded and guided it) evolved in ways that illuminate changes in the role of Jewish women and the Jewish home. Jewish cuisine has also played a bit part in shaping the restaurant scene in the West, in particular in the UK and US. Israeli cuisine in particular has become a leading food trend in the UK, with many Israeli restaurants now opening up sister restaurants in London and beyond.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{additional}} claims {{as to the}} origin of the hambuger. Some enthusiasts claim the hamburger could have been created in São Gonçalo, a municipality located in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, in the 18th century by a Chef named Sauerbrown [...] "Little" [...] Victor, but this claim has no supporting evidence to back the opinion. A local newspaper claims that Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant who arrived in America in 1880, sold butter and eggs as a street vendor. In 1974, in an interview with The New York Times, he recounted how he created a hamburger steak sandwich with small strips of beef for a restaurant known as Louis' Lunch. Lassen's family claims 1900 as the year of his invention. Revealed in a public confrontation between the grandson of Louis, Kenneth Davis Lassen Fletch, and his uncle, documentation signed under notary in 1900 demonstrates the development of the hamburger, as it stresses the difference between a [...] "hamburger steak" [...] and a [...] "hamburger sandwich". Louis' Lunch flame broils the hamburgers in the original vertical cast iron gas stoves manufactured by the Bridge and Beach, Co., St. Louis, Missouri in 1898. The stoves use hinged steel wire gridirons to hold the hamburgers in place while <b>they</b> <b>cook</b> simultaneously on both sides. The gridirons were made by Luigi Pieragostini and patented in 1938.|$|E

5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = <b>they</b> <b>cooked</b> it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = they caused it to be <b>cooked</b> (<b>they</b> had it <b>cooked)</b> [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = they caused it to be caused to be <b>cooked</b> (<b>they</b> had someone have it <b>cooked)</b> piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = <b>they</b> caused it to be caused to be caused to be <b>cooked</b> (<b>they</b> had someone have someone have it <b>cooked)</b> piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = <b>they</b> caused it to be caused to be caused to be caused to be <b>cooked</b> (<b>they</b> had someone have someone have someone have it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R

60|$|I {{venture to}} {{conceive}} that, on reflection, Mr. Podmore will doubt {{whether he has}} discovered an universal law of excited malperception, or whether the remarkable, and certainly undesigned, coincidence of testimony to the singular flight of objects does not rather point to an 'abnormal agency' uniform in its effects. Contagious hallucination cannot affect witnesses ignorant of each other's existence in many lands and ages, nor could <b>they</b> <b>cook</b> their reports to suit reports of which they never heard.|$|E

Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>cook</b> food and place it in the dry bed of a river, or some other secluded spot, and then call on their deceased ancestors by name. 'Come and partake of this! Give us maintenance as you did when living! Come, wheresoever you may be; on a tree, on a rock, in the forest, come!'
