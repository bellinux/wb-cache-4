5|$|From 1937 {{new steel}} O stock trains, with doors {{remotely}} {{operated by the}} guard, replaced the wooden-bodied trains dating from 1906. It had been intended to operate the new trains with four or six cars, but after initial problems with the <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> only six-car formations were used. Services to Kensington (Olympia) via the curve at Latimer Road were suspended in 1940 after bomb damage to the West London line and not restarted after the war. When the similar trains running on the Circle line were lengthened to six cars in 1959 and 1960, the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance at Hammersmith depot. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trade unions was not introduced until 1984.|$|E
5|$|Since 1904, {{after the}} District had {{notified}} the Met {{that it would}} not use its running rights on the Uxbridge line with steam trains, it had not run services, although it paid the £2,000 a year that was due under the enabling Act. When the District suggested running as far as Rayners Lane, the Met responded with a proposal to rebuild the station as a District terminus. The District proposed running trains through to Uxbridge, leading to negotiations about the charges for <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> before District services were extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910. In 1910 a platform was built at Mill Hill Park for the Hounslow and Uxbridge shuttles and a flying junction built north of the station to separate the Ealing and Hounslow traffic. The station was renamed Acton Town on 1 March 1910.|$|E
5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|In some railway {{electrification}} schemes, {{one or both}} of the running rails are used to carry the return current. This prevents use of the basic DC track circuit because the substantial <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> overwhelm the very small track circuit currents.|$|R
30|$|The {{study of}} internal-wave and internal-tide {{deposits}} {{is a new}} research field on sedimentology during the last ten years. Deep-water <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> induced by internal waves and internal tides are developed on the modern sea floor, which can form not only all kinds of small scale and dispersal deepwater <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> deposits, but also large-scale sediment wave in km-size scale. In this paper, the concepts and features of internal waves and internal tides in oceanography are introduced, and the characteristics, sedimentary sequences, sedimentary microfacies and sedimentation models of internal-wave and internal-tide deposits found and the origin of large scale sediment waves in deep sea bottom are summarized. The relationship between internal-wave and internal-tide deposits and petroleum is discussed, and finally internal-wave and internal-tide deposits are {{shown to be a}} new potential field for petroleum exploration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The new Italian {{high-speed}} railway {{lines are}} characterised by a 2 x 25 kV – 50 Hz electrification standard. Train operation {{is carried out}} by the innovative ERTMS level II signalling system that is supported by audio frequency track circuits (AF-TC). The choice of the audio frequency is due to the necessity of eliminating the interference problems between 50 Hz <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> and track circuit operation. The paper illustrates the audio frequency models, implemented in Alternative Transient Program (ATP), of both the electrification system and the track circuits. Interferences between <b>traction</b> harmonic <b>currents</b> and track circuit operation, compromising the system availability degree and the transportation regularity, are here analysed. The main results, concerning system resonance frequencies and rail current distribution, are presented and discussed...|$|R
25|$|The fast {{lines were}} {{blocked by the}} {{derailment}} and the <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> to the slow lines was turned off to allow the rescue. <b>Traction</b> <b>current</b> was temporarily restored to the slow lines for the Tuesday morning rush hour and returned to traffic at 15:40 that afternoon. The fast lines were reopened with a speed restriction at 06:20 Wednesday morning.|$|E
25|$|Typically an {{electric}} railway will {{have at least}} one of the rails used as a return conductor for the <b>traction</b> <b>current.</b> This rail is in contact with the earth at many places throughout its length. Since current will follow every parallel path between source and load, some part of the <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> will also flow through the earth. Where the railway uses direct current, this stray current can cause damage to other buried metallic objects by electrolysis and accelerate corrosion of metal objects in touch with the soil.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{advantage}} of the fourth-rail system is that, in tunnels with a metallic (usually cast-iron) lining, the return <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> does not leak into the lining causing electrolytic corrosion there or in the neighbouring utility mains. The two running rails are available exclusively for track circuits.|$|E
40|$|Well-rounded cobbles were {{encountered}} {{within a}} low-energy restricted marine organic-rich deposit of latest Cretaceous age in Chukotka, NE Asia. The clasts are hydrodynamically {{incompatible with the}} inferred quiet depositional environment of the host sediment. Driftwood capable of tree-rafting, glacial striations, gastrolith clast clustering, and disrupting clast impact impressions typical of volcanic ejecta were absent, as were signs of <b>traction</b> <b>currents.</b> If indeed ice-rafting is responsible, this supports recent climate models and palaeobotanical data which favour seasonal marine ice cover of high northern latitudes over a wide span of boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{new high}} speed railway lines, under {{construction}} in Italy, are electrified in 2 times 25 kHz - 50 Hz and, {{in order to avoid}} interference problems between <b>traction</b> and signaling <b>current,</b> make use of a signaling system based on audio frequency track circuits (AF-TC), ranging from 2. 1 kHz to 16. 5 kHz. Problems could arise from the fact that <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> required by high-speed locomotives, equipped with electronic static converters, show a harmonic spectrum which includes audio frequencies. Since the tracks are means of propagation of both <b>traction</b> and signaling <b>currents,</b> interference problems in the standard operation can occur with possible impact on transportation regularity. Thus, preliminary studies of the compatibility between traction and signaling system (where the traction load is a disturbance source and the signaling circuit is a disturbance victim), under standard and failure conditions, are required. In this context, a measurement campaign on the AF-TC of the new high speed railway system Rome-Naples has been made and some results are reported in this pape...|$|R
40|$|Bottom sediments {{from the}} Skagerrak were {{collected}} on localities chosen {{on the basis of}} their acoustical characteristics. The grain-size distribution, lithology and clay mineralogy have been studied, as well as carbonate content and content of organic carbon. These data have been related to the present day current pattern. The Skagerrak obviously acts as a sink for recent sediments that are transported by <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> along the bottom and in suspension or by a combination of these. The main depot centres for very fine sand are situated north-west of Skagen and in the entrance of the Kattegat, whereas silt and clay-size materials are found in the deeper parts and off the Norwegian and Swedish coasts. Locally till-like sediments occur. ...|$|R
25|$|Electrification cost: {{electrification}} {{requires an}} entire new infrastructure {{to be built}} around the existing tracks at a significant cost. Costs are especially high when tunnels, bridges and other obstructions have to be altered for clearance. Another aspect that can raise the cost of electrification are the alterations or upgrades to railway signalling needed for new traffic characteristics, and to protect signalling circuitry and track circuits from interference by <b>traction</b> <b>current.</b> Electrification may require line closures while the new equipment is being installed.|$|E
25|$|The OLE (overhead line equipment) {{system has}} been {{extended}} from Farringdon to City Thameslink and was commissioned in December 2009, Combined with a new crossover in Snow Hill tunnel between the two stations, this allows southbound trains to be turned back should they fail to change from London Midland Region AC <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> to Southern Region third rail. The crossover currently located within City Thameslink station {{for the purpose of}} allowing trains from Smithfield sidings to enter platform 2 was removed as Blackfriars station was rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 1980s the 1940 {{rolling stock}} fleet was giving {{increasingly}} difficult service. The decision was taken to acquire new vehicles as an extension to a rolling stock acquisition programme on the Central line of London Transport (LT). This required implementation of fourth rail <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> system to maintain consistency with the LT fleet: a new aluminium centre current rail was provided. (The original steel positive rail was replaced by an aluminium one in 2008.) The new vehicles had passenger operated door opening buttons, which were unlikely to be required on the Waterloo & City line.|$|E

30|$|Wilson and Schieber (2014, 2017) {{interpreted}} traction {{structures in}} mudstone as hyperpycnites. Traction structures are characteristic attributes of bottom currents reworking by contour currents, tidal currents, wind-driven currents, and baroclinic currents (Hollister 1967; Martín–Chivelet et al. 2008; Shanmugam 2008 b, 2013, 2016 b, 2017 b; Shanmugam et al. 1993). Mutti (2009) attributed {{the origin of}} hummocky cross-stratification (HCS), normally associated with storm deposits, to deposition by hyperpycnal flows. Gao et al. (2014) studied the modern Yellow River Delta and proposed a facies distribution (Fig.  14 c). The Yellow River Delta model exhibits many attributes of the classic Mississippi River Delta (Coleman and Prior 1982), including <b>traction</b> <b>currents.</b> In summary, {{there is a wide}} range of opinions in interpreting traction structures.|$|R
30|$|DC {{electric}} railways produce magnetic fields, {{not only}} from the intended <b>traction</b> <b>currents,</b> but also from unintended earth-leakage currents; these fields, particularly those from the leakage currents, are becoming an increasing problem for geomagneticians. This paper introduces the relevant properties of DC-railway traction-power circuits, and the various ways in which earth-leakage currents are produced, and discusses models of how these leakage currents vary along the track and with train position. It describes the geometry of the resultant magnetic fields, and gives the formal algebra for calculating the magnetic field when these leakage currents are known, but also suggests some simple approximations that could be used when the current distribution is not known in detail. This paper also summarises previous relevant papers.|$|R
25|$|A major {{design flaw}} {{with the class}} was that the <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> {{circuits}} of each bogie were not isolated. The third rail supply is generated close to the rail line {{and there are many}} areas where it changes from one substation to another. Although great effort is made to ensure the voltages are the same between sections, at the extreme ends of supply there can be very large differences due mainly to voltage drops caused by other electric trains. There are examples of fires in class 73 where the locomotive has acted as an electrical bridge between two different substations causing the traction circuit inside the locomotive to take the brunt of the huge surges in supply as trains move {{in and out of the}} sections behind and in front. This problem was particularly noticeable at junctions where conductor rails cannot be separated by a good distance and many of the class were damaged by fire caused in this manner over the years. Class 73s were well known for incredible displays of arcing at the collector shoes for this exact reason.|$|E

40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of <b>traction</b> voltages and <b>currents</b> {{are the basis}} for assessing energy electromagnetic processes in systems of electric traction, in particular, DC. The latter {{is due to the}} fact that the DC system is not in consequence of nonstationary random character of change of <b>traction</b> voltage and <b>current.</b> Nonperiodic stochastic nature of the change of voltage and current calls for study of their spectral composition using probabilistic methods based on spectral correlation theory of random processes. The theoretical assumptions and the relations of connection of the energy spectrum of a random process with his correlating function are set out. The results of the numerical calculations of the spectra of <b>traction</b> voltages and <b>currents</b> actually operating electrical subsystems transport are given; they are: feeder voltage at the <b>traction</b> substation; <b>currents</b> in modes of traction and recuperation of electric locomotives in accordance with DE 1 and VL 8; the voltage on the current collector of the city tram. It is established that energy spectra of random processes traction and recuperative voltages and currents are probabilistic in nature, depending on technological factors of the system, and the energy of the random process is numerically greater in traction mode than in the regenerative braking mode...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe article {{examines}} the main sources of EMF harmful effects affecting the electrical personnel. Harmonic composition of the rectified voltage at traction substations is analyzed. The article presents rectified voltage timing diagrams. Canonical and harmonic components of rectified voltage at the output of 6 -pulse rectifier are shown. The article shows that a rectifier converter {{is a source of}} AC harmonic components and has a variety of electric and magnetic forces, the harmful effects of which on the staff have not yet been studied. It is shown that particularly in the railway transport traction networks during the use of 6 -pulse VP (Kubler circuit), the operating voltages and the electric <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> result in the creation of electric field forces caused by harmonic components, which in some cases significantly exceed the maximum permissible forces regulated in foreign practice...|$|R
40|$|Coarsening upwards {{sequences}} 8 - 40 m thick {{are described}} in which four major facies can be recognised: 1. Lenticular bedded mudstohe; 2. Wavy bedded fine sandstone; 3.

Facies 1 and 2 are horizontally bedded-whereas facies 3 and 4 form large-scale cross-sets. Palaeocurrent data suggest a WNW-ESE trending coastline, with strong bi-directional currents operating normal to it. Mud-draped föresets, bipolar cross-sets and sharp alternations between deposition by <b>traction</b> <b>currents</b> and accretion from suspension indicate a tidal environment. Both shoreface and deltaic progradation are considered unlikely, and an estuarine model similar to the Heligoland Bight of the southern North Sea is proposed.

The exact location of M42 is a closely guarded secret and does not appear on maps, though it has been shown on the History Channel program Cities of the Underworld and a National Geographic special. Two of the original rotary converters were not removed in the late 20th century when solid-state ones took over their job, and they remain as a historical record. During World War II, this facility was closely guarded because its sabotage would have impaired troop movement on the Eastern Seaboard. It is said that any unauthorized person entering the facility during the war risked being shot on sight; the rotary converters could have easily been crippled by a bucket of sand. Abwehr (a German espionage service) sent two spies to sabotage it; they were arrested by the FBI before they could strike.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the track}} and the rolling stock used on this line and the North London Line were changed to use a {{modified}} version of the BR standard third rail system, with the fourth rail (now bonded to the running rail used for returning <b>traction</b> <b>current)</b> left in place on the sections of line shared with LU Bakerloo line trains. North of Harrow & Wealdstone, now the limit of LU operation, the fourth rail has in most places been dropped onto the sleepers and remains bonded, thus leaving the resistance of the current return path unaltered. The fourth rail remains in the normal position from Queens Park to Kilburn High Road up platform, where a trailing crossover between those two stations is maintained in use to allow reversal of Bakerloo line trains unable to gain access to London Underground at Queens Park, due to planned work or other reasons. [...] The line is currently electrified (like all shared lines) using the standard compromise voltage of 660V.

2500|$|The more {{high-profile}} unit preserved is {{the former}} South West Trains (SWT) [...] "celebrity" [...] unit painted in BR blue livery with painted aluminium window frames, number 3417. The unit was initially used on Wimbledon depot as a shunter, but with SWT needing to get it off its books it was sold to the Bluebell Railway for the nominal sum of £1. It was moved to Eastleigh Works for storage, after having been used initially as the centrepiece for the Bluebell in a ceremony at East Grinstead railway station to mark the commencement of work at the station site {{as part of the}} line's work on the northern extension. The unit returned to East Grinstead for further use and storage in September 2010. In late April, the unit sustained minor damage to its shoegear as it was being towed from Clapham Junction Yard to the Swanage Railway.

50|$|A <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> pylon is a {{railroad}} pylon carrying {{at least one}} circuit for <b>traction</b> <b>current.</b> In Germany, <b>traction</b> <b>current</b> lines with two systems (4 conductor cables) typically have a single level arrangement of the conductor cables.
