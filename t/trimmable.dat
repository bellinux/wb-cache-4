25|$|Jet Commander {{production}} {{amounted to}} 150 {{aircraft in the}} United States and Israel before IAI undertook a series of modifications to create the 1123 Westwind. These included stretching the fuselage and increased maximum takeoff, maximum landing, and maximum zero-fuel weights, with the wing modified to incorporate double-slotted flaps and drooped leading edges and tip tanks. The <b>trimmable</b> horizontal stabiliser was also modified to have increased span and more travel. Not long after the aircraft went into production, the original General Electric CJ610 turbojet engines were replaced by more fuel-efficient Garrett TFE731 turbofans There were also numerous airframe modifications, such as drooped leading edges on the wings, a dorsal fin, revised engine pylons and nacelles, and further increases in maximum takeoff, maximum landing, and maximum zero-fuel weights. With improvements {{to a number of}} onboard systems incorporated as well, these changes resulted in the 1124 Westwind delivered from 1976.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Technical Commission of the MAK, {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} the flight recorders indicated that the aircraft's <b>trimmable</b> horizontal stabilizer was set to 8.7 degrees [...] "nose up" [...] and its wing flaps were in the take-off position of 20 degrees. The engines were functioning until [...] "collision with obstacles." [...] According to Russia's aviation authority, the flight recorders gave no indication of sub-standard fuel. An {{analysis of the}} fuel in the fuel tanks at Tunoshna Airport showed that it met requirements for aviation fuel. After the crash, the airport ordered that no aircraft were to refuel there during the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is <b>trimmable</b> by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E
2500|$|The Model 200 was {{originally}} conceived as the Model 101 in 1969, {{and was a}} development of the Model 100 King Air. The Model 200 had essentially the same fuselage as the Model 100, with changes to the rear fuselage to accommodate a new T-tail (in place of the 100's conventional tail with all-moving <b>trimmable</b> horizontal stabilizer) and structural changes to allow higher maximum pressurization. Apart from the T-tail, other changes included Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-41 engines rated at [...] instead of the [...] engines of the Model A100 then in production, and a wing of increased span and extra fuel capacity. Overall, the 200 was 3ft 10 in (1.17 m) longer than the A100, with wingspan 4ft 3 in (1.29 m) greater, containing [...] more fuel. Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) was increased by 1,000lb (450kg). After protracted development including extensive wind tunnel testing of the design (especially of the T-tail which was tunnel-tested for 375 hours), the first prototype flew {{for the first time}} on October 27, 1972; a second prototype took to the air on December 15 the same year. Three production aircraft were also built in 1972 and delivered to the U.S. Army; these three were designated Model A100-1s by Beechcraft and were given the military designation RU-21J; the first of some 400 T-tail King Airs to be ordered by the U.S. armed forces. The 200 received civil certification in December 1973 and the first civil delivery took place in February 1974.|$|E
50|$|A trimmer is a {{miniature}} adjustable electrical component. It {{is meant to}} be set correctly when installed in some device, and never seen or adjusted by the device's user. Trimmers can be variable resistors (potentiometers), variable capacitors, or <b>trimmable</b> inductors. They are common in precision circuitry like A/V components, and may need to be adjusted when the equipment is serviced. Trimpots are often used to initially calibrate equipment after manufacturing. Unlike many other variable controls, trimmers are mounted directly on circuit boards, turned with a small screwdriver and rated for many fewer adjustments over their lifetime. Trimmers like <b>trimmable</b> inductors and <b>trimmable</b> capacitors are usually found in superhet radio and television receivers, in the intermediate frequency (IF), oscillator and radio frequency (RF) circuits. They are adjusted into the right position during the alignment procedure of the receiver.|$|E

50|$|Most airliners and {{transport}} aircraft feature a large, slow-moving <b>trimmable</b> tail plane which {{is combined with}} independently-moving elevators. The elevators are controlled by the pilot or autopilot and primarily serve to change the aircraft’s attitude, while the whole assembly is used to trim (maintaining horizontal static equilibrium) and stabilize the aircraft in the pitch axis.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{development}} of Prof. Mathews is the Papercopter, a model helicopter whose 'wing' is a <b>trimmable</b> annular ring which, using rotational aerodynamics to provide good forward flight performance without {{need for a}} tail rotor. A model helicopter 'body' is suspended beneath the ring, and uses airflow to stabilise itself {{in the direction of}} flight, much like a weather vane.|$|E
50|$|The second aircraft, {{built in}} 1974, which {{incorporates}} an all-metal wing {{to address the}} fabric issues on the first aircraft. It also has retractable monowheel landing gear, the nose and canopy from a Schempp-Hirth Open Cirrus, flaps, water ballast and a fully <b>trimmable</b> tailplane. The aircraft is officially registered with the FAA as a UHP-1 MODIFIED and has an empty weight {{that is more than}} 100 lb heavier than the prototype.|$|E
50|$|It is {{simpler to}} {{substitute}} the potentiometer or the SOT part with a <b>trimmable</b> chip resistor or chip capacitor, and the potentiometer adjusting screwdriver {{is replaced by}} the laser trimming. The achieved accuracy can be higher, the procedure can be automated and the long term stability is better than with potentiometers and at least as good as with SOT components. Often the laser for active trimming can be integrated in existing measurement systems by the manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Direct law (DIR) {{introduces}} a direct stick-to-control surfaces relationship: control surface motion {{is directly related}} to the sidestick and rudder pedal motion. The <b>trimmable</b> horizontal stabilizer can only be controlled by the manual trim wheel. All protections are lost, and the maximum deflection of the elevators is limited for each configuration as a function of the current aircraft centre of gravity. This aims to create a compromise between adequate pitch control with a forward C.G. and not-too-sensitive control with an aft C.G.|$|E
50|$|The Pingouin was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a braced <b>trimmable</b> horizontal tail {{surface with}} elevators, {{and a single}} fin and rudder. It had a tailwheel landing gear with outward-retracting main gear. The engine was nose-mounted and the Pingouin had an enclosed cabin that seated four in two rows of two. Like the Bf 108, the wings had automatic leading edge slats and could be folded when the aircraft was on the ground, allowing the complete aircraft to be transported by rail.|$|E
50|$|Investigators then {{inspected}} the flight controls of Flight 605, {{which were the}} rudder, the ailerons, the <b>trimmable</b> horizontal stabilizer, the flaps and slats, and several other flight controls. However, they didn't find any abnormalities on these controls. Control failure was ruled out from {{the cause of the}} crash. According to investigators, they also ruled out terrorism as the cause of the crash, as there were no sign of on board explosion during the approach and there were no evidence of explosives on board.|$|E
50|$|At 02:10:34 UTC, after {{displaying}} incorrectly {{for half}} a minute, the left-side instruments recorded a sharp rise in airspeed to 223 kn, as did the Integrated Standby Instrument System (ISIS) 33 seconds later (the right-side instruments are not recorded by the recorder). The icing event had lasted for just over a minute. The pilot continued making nose-up inputs. The <b>trimmable</b> horizontal stabilizer (THS) moved from three to 13 degrees nose-up in about one minute, and remained in that latter position {{until the end of}} the flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} {{resistances}} from one decade {{to the next}} is, surprisingly, not critical — by using Ri+1 resistances slightly higher than Ri / 5 and connecting a trimming resistor in parallel to the entire preceding decade in order to trim the effective resistance down to 2 &times; Ri+1. In the above example, the second stage might use 3 kΩ resistors instead of 2 kΩ; connecting a (<b>trimmable)</b> resistor of 60 kΩ in parallel with the second stage brings the total input resistance of the second stage down to the 20 kΩ required.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} altitude, the autopilot then commanded a continuous nose-up movement of the <b>trimmable</b> horizontal stabilizer and the elevators. This resulted {{in an increase in}} the angle of attack of up to 24°, or 13° above the stall angle of attack in the event conditions, as well as the broadcast of several [...] "STABILIZER MOTION" [...] warnings. Both engines suffered a surge probably due to the plane's high angle of attack. Both engines RPM then decreased to values close to idle. This surge may have been noticed by the crew.|$|E

50|$|A camlock is an {{interchangeable}} {{electrical connector}} {{often used in}} temporary electrical power production and distribution. The most common form is the 16 series, rated at 400 amperes with 105 °C terminations. Also in common use is the 15 series (mini-cam), rated at 150 amperes. A larger version is made denoted as the 17 series with ratings up to 760 A. A ball nose version and a longer nose standard version exist-the latter is the most common. Another version is the Posi-lok which has controlled interconnection sequencing to a panel and a shrouded connector body.The early version original connector was hot-vulcanized to the cable body;later versions use dimensional pressure to exclude foreign material from the connector pin area;the tail of the connector insulator body is <b>trimmable</b> to fit the cable outer diameter.|$|E

Roughly speaking, a class C of graphs is <b>trimmable</b> if, for each graph G∈C, it is possible to remove a small proportion of the vertices of G to obtain a graph with no long simple paths. More generally, one considers vertex-weighted graphs and tries to remove a set of vertices of small weight.

40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{building}} blocks of an electronic system is the digital-to-analogue converter (DAC) which forms the interface between the digital and analogue component parts. In order to achieve the high performance required by many systems, particularly communications systems, the DAC requires careful, time consuming and expensive design and layout which increases {{the cost of the}} entire system. This design process is required to minimise the mismatches between the current sources in the current steering DAC. <b>Trimmable</b> current sources, based on floating-gate devices, are therefore proposed in order to simplify the design of a DAC. A floating-gate device is a form of an analogue non-volatile memory which can be programmed to control the threshold voltage of a MOSFET. Four different current sources are designed to use a floating-gate device in three distinct ways: as a <b>trimmable</b> current source, as a <b>trimmable</b> voltage source and as a <b>trimmable</b> resistor. All the current sources have a sufficient trimming range to correct for any process and parameter variations. However, a major concern about floating-gate devices is their ability to retain a programmed voltage. It is shown that these current sources can be biased so that they retain a programmed floating-gate voltage over several days of normal operation. Even with this characteristic, a variation in the operating temperature of the current sources will cause a significant variation in the output current. Therefore, the temperature characteristics of the current sources are investigated to determine the impact of temperature variations. A distinct biasing condition is identified in all the current sources which causes the output current to be insensitive to temperature variations. Furthermore, one design is identified which is temperature insensitive over a significant trimming range. </p...|$|E
