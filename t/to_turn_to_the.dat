5|$|Hurricane Mitch {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast of Honduras, and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the Honduras and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134km (83mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country.|$|E
5|$|At Lexington Avenue, NY92 begins <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{southeast}} as it heads {{through more}} residential {{areas of the}} city. At East Avenue, a local street just west of Nottingham Senior High School, a center lane begins, enabling left turns from both directions. The route passes north {{of the school and}} St. Mary's Cemetery and south of LeMoyne College before exiting the city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from Syracuse to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Now in DeWitt, NY92 continues past several blocks lined with homes to an intersection with Erie Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that carries NY5 through eastern Syracuse. The boulevard ends here, however, and NY5 turns to join NY92 eastward along Genesee Street.|$|E

5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E
5|$|Bypassing Vigo on {{his flight}} southwards, Villeneuve {{put into the}} Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August. By abandoning his efforts to reach the English Channel, Villeneuve was in effect abandoning the entire {{invasion}} strategy and, when news of Villeneuve's retreat reached him, Napoleon decided to formally abandon the campaign, marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border. Without instructions from his superior, and with no idea where the main French fleet was, Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third aspect of his orders, the disruption of British trade.|$|E

West of Wellton, the highway takes a northeasterly course, paralleling the Gila River and passing {{to the south}} of Roll. Through this part of Arizona, I-8 passes along the northern edge of the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and {{to the south of}} the Yuma Proving Ground. It keeps a northeastern heading, passing through the community of Dateland, until it reaches Gila Bend. There, the freeway intersects SR85 heading north to Phoenix and south to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes {{well away from the}} Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.|$|E
5|$|NY191 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY22 and Miner Farm Road (CR23) in the Clinton County hamlet of Sciota, {{located within the}} town of Chazy. The route headed to the northeast as a two-lane county-maintained, state-numbered highway, overlapping with CR23 and taking on the Miner Farm Road name. East of Sciota, the highway traversed lightly developed areas, serving several residences separated by patches of woodlands. The route eventually began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast, connecting with Angelville Road (unsigned CR20) in the process. A long stretch of dense forests followed the turn, with little to no development along the highway.|$|E

5|$|NY21 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY417 {{in the village}} of Andover. The route heads northward, paralleling the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (WNYP) through a rural stretch of eastern Allegany County. At Alfred Station, located just east of the village of Alfred, the highway meets the eastern terminus of NY244. NY21 and the WNYP head northeast through the village of Almond to the Steuben County line, where the road and rail line begin <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast toward Hornell. The portion of NY21 near Almond briefly parallels the Southern Tier Expressway, designated Interstate86 (I-86) and NY17. East of the county line, NY21 leaves the vicinity of the expressway and passes through another undeveloped stretch to reach the city of Hornell, where it becomes West Main Street.|$|E
5|$|On February10, MFR began {{tracking}} {{a tropical}} disturbance in the Mozambique channel near Juan de Nova Island. The system tracked generally south-southwestward, gradually intensifying. Given the name Imboa, the storm reached peak winds of 95km/h (60mph) on February13 while passing near Europa Island. After executing a small loop, Imboa {{turned toward the}} southeastern African coastline and approached the eastern coasts of Mozambique and South Africa as a weakened system. A ridge caused the storm <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and northeast, dissipating on February19.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center {{predicted}} that Gustav would approach the North Carolina coast, {{and issued a}} tropical storm watch from Cape Fear to the North Carolina – Virginia border. The tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on September 9, and a new tropical storm watch was issued later that day for areas of southeastern Virginia, from the North Carolina – Virginia border to New Point Comfort. The new watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on September 10. As Gustav began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast {{and away from the}} Mid-Atlantic coast, the tropical storm warnings were gradually discontinued.

5|$|Philip was {{now able}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Illyrians, {{who were still}} occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty or not). He held an {{assembly}} of the army, gathered together a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria. Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace {{on the basis of}} the status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{discouraged}} {{manufacturing in}} its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including {{all of those}} in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels {{in the hopes of}} dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Veracruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very expensive in the Texas settlements. Settlers were often forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French for supplies, as the fort at Natchitoches was well-stocked and goods did not have to travel as far. Without many goods to trade, however, the remaining Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{predicted}} Flora <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest {{after entering}} the Windward Passage and affect the Bahamas. Forecasters advised those in The Bahamas to quickly complete preparations, though {{the eye of}} the hurricane did not pass over the archipelago until four days later. When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane, and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor the hurricane. At its closest approach to Florida, the hurricane remained 330miles (530km) away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart to Key West due to the hurricane's large size.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} gradually tracked northwestward at 15mph (24km/h). Although {{the center}} of the depression was initially uncertain, it slowly strengthened and steadily organized. The depression attained tropical storm status late on August 20, upon which the storm was named Lester. The cyclone continued to the northwest, and passed directly over Socorro Island on August 21. By early the next day, an eastward moving trough weakened the ridge to its north, resulting in a <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. Around this time, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted the storm would not strengthen to hurricane intensity before making landfall. Despite this, Lester intensified into a hurricane late on August 22 while located about 240miles (385km) west of La Paz in Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|The steppe {{societies}} of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured a pastoral economy, stood {{in stark contrast}} to the Chinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature, communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads. According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model. As the steppe population grew, pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards. For these needs, the nomads had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> settled societies to get grains, metal tools, and luxury goods, which they could not produce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest.|$|E
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.|$|E
