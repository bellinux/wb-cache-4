5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although {{it has been suggested}} that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, Juravenator, and Megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian Agilisaurus was inferred to be diurnal.|$|E

5|$|In {{automatic}} test pattern generation, finding cliques {{can help to}} bound {{the size of a}} test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E
5|$|Methods <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> process-based {{convergence}} fit {{models of}} selection to a phylogeny and continuous trait data {{to determine whether}} the same selective forces have acted upon lineages. This uses the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to test different scenarios of selection. Other methods rely on an a priori specification of where shifts in selection have occurred.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there are}} growing needs for haptic {{exploration}} to estimate and extract physical object properties such as mass, friction, elasticity, and function, etc [...] In this paper, we propose a novel ”analysis by simulation ” approach <b>to</b> <b>inferring</b> function of articulated objects, through reality-based interactions for function tests in virtual environ-ments. Function inferred {{as a result}} of virtual function tests should be consistent with that inferred in the real world, because such interactions are simulated and gen-erated according to: 1) the real intension and real action taken by the agent, and also 2) the real geometrical and real physical object properties obtained from observation of their behaviors in the real world. We applied the pro-posed method <b>to</b> <b>inferring</b> multiple funciotns of a pair of nutcrackers and a pair of tongs, such as ”pinch”, ”hold”, ”carry ” and ”crash ” etc [...] Experimental results demon-strate the vilidity, effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach...|$|R

5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The {{results indicate that}} S.spraguei is most closely related to S.decipiens. The species S.granulatus and S.placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S.spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> daily activity patterns of pterosaurs. The pterosaur genera Pterodactylus, Scaphognathus, and Tupuxuara have been inferred to be diurnal, Ctenochasma, Pterodaustro, and Rhamphorhynchus have been inferred to be nocturnal, and Tapejara has been inferred to be cathemeral, being active throughout the day for short intervals. As a result, the possibly fish-eating Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus may have had similar activity patterns to modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding Pterodaustro may have had similar activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs Ctenochasma, Rhamphorhynchus, Scaphognathus, and Pterodactylus may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.|$|E

5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer.

Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees can be used <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> the evolutionary history of populations. The classic {{example of this is}} in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E
