5|$|As a result, the {{referendum}} on 29 April was categorically rejected with 802,512 votes (42.4%) for abolition and 1,089,193 votes (57.5%) against. This {{would be the}} last attempt to abolish the council and, as the first time the NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was widely seen as <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941. Heffron's supporter Dougherty resigned from the council a month later in protest of the result.|$|E
5|$|Extending {{the work}} of Vesalius into {{experiments}} on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), William Harvey and other natural philosophers investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries. Harvey's De motu cordis in 1628 was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for Galenic theory, and alongside Santorio Santorio's studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{had promised}} Hitler that Adlertag and Adlerangriff would achieve the results {{required}} within days, or at worst weeks. It {{had meant to}} be <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of RAF Fighter Command, but Adlertag and the following operations failed to destroy the RAF, or gain the necessary local air superiority. As a result, Operation Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for these mystics.|$|E
5|$|The Cougars didn't {{play the}} Longhorns again until 1968. With UH fans {{holding up the}} new sign of Cougar pride, UH played UT to a 20–20 tie. They didn't meet again until 1976, the first year UH {{was a member of}} the Southwest Conference. In front of a record crowd at Texas' Memorial Stadium, UH {{defeated}} UT 30–0, a rout that signaled <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for legendary Texas coach Darrell Royal. This solidified the use of the Cougar Paw as a tradition.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{handed the}} ACLU two key {{victories}} in 1957, in Watkins v. United States and Yates v. United States, {{both of which}} undermined the Smith Act and marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of communist party membership inquiries. In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including Lamont v. Postmaster General (in which the plaintiff was Corliss Lamont, a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.|$|E

5|$|The pre-dreadnought age saw <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 19th century naval {{balance of}} power in which France and Russia vied for {{competition}} against the massive British Royal Navy, and saw the start of the rise of the 'new naval powers' of Germany, Japan and the USA.

5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return to Turf Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness and injury. A collision with Wycombe Wanderers' Jason Cousins on 20 February 1999 spelt <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for Swan's career, {{as the result of}} a scan showed he had snapped the cruciate ligament in his right knee.|$|E
5|$|After the Federal army {{rebuilt the}} City Point Railroad, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's {{overstretched}} forces. In August, Union forces captured Mobile Bay and on September 2, Sherman captured Atlanta while Confederate forces retreated. Both victories, combined with Sheridan's triumph in the Shenandoah Valley, ensured Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln {{to send his}} army to march on Savannah and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville. It was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being the only significant obstacle remaining.|$|E

5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. <b>The</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; {{in his first year}} as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E

On February 17, Microsoft released an update to its business line of software in Windows 2000. It provided a high level of stability similar to that of its Unix counterparts due to its usage of the Windows NT kernel, and matching features found in the consumer line of the Windows operating system including a DOS emulator that could run many legacy DOS applications.|$|E
5|$|The Citroën AX was {{launched}} without a twin in 1986, {{and the only}} other Talbot in development, the Arizona family hatchback, {{was launched}} instead as the Peugeot 309 {{at the end of}} 1985. Production of the Samba ended in May 1986, by which time 270,555 had been made, signalling <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Talbot brand for passenger cars, the death knell finally sounding the following year when the last Horizon rolled off the production line in Finland, although the brand survived on commercial vehicles until 1994.|$|E

5|$|The century {{following}} 1750 {{was time}} of significant change. New forms of transport, industry and agriculture brought sweeping changes, {{and an end}} to traditional ways of life that had endured for centuries. The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some, these transformations came at a cost for others. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on Arran's population. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow. A memorial to this early form of ethnic cleansing has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the imperial forces from Sicily resulted in the rapid collapse of the imperial position there. Under Maniakes, the Byzantines had conquered the eastern portion of the island, but by 1042, only Messina remained in Byzantine hands. On the mainland, Boioannes did not fare better than his predecessor, as he was defeated and taken prisoner at the Battle of Montepeloso in September. This succession of defeats signalled <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for Byzantine rule in southern Italy, a process which was completed three decades later {{with the fall of}} Bari to the Normans under Robert Guiscard.|$|E
5|$|While {{national}} security concerns were {{cited as the}} grounds for rejection, politics {{played an important role}} as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if SNECMA pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of American aerospace leadership.|$|E

5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, it was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> During November, the Presidium, under Husak, {{declared}} that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even {{going so far as to}} not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E
5|$|In Milan, Sforza's enemies worked {{continually}} against him. The Piccinino brothers, sons {{of famous}} condottiere Niccolò Piccinino and former Captains-General before being replaced as supreme military commanders by Sforza, convinced the suspicious Republic to work secretly against Sforza. Rumors were spread among the troops about not receiving payment {{at the end}} of the war if they remained with Sforza, and Sforza himself was ordered back from the siege of Brescia, the city promised to him, while the citizens were secretly told to hold out until peace, already in the works, was signed. Sforza learned of this treachery and defected to the Venetians for 13,000 ducats and the Duchy of Milan in return for the Ghiaradadda, Crema, and his service. The treaty was signed on 18 October 1448, and Sforza now undid everything he had labored for over the past year. With such a powerful man on the Venetian side, it was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Golden Ambrosian Republic. Public opinion, despite the government's position, was generally pro-Sforza, and only an impassioned, patriotic speech from Giorgio Lampugnano subdued it at last. The Piccinino brothers became Captains-General once more, but were not as capable as the brilliant Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E
