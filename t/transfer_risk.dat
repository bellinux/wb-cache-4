5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. <b>Transfer</b> <b>risk</b> emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: identification of participating parties (the insurer, the insured, the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary {{in the event of a}} loss), and exclusions (events not covered). An insured is thus said to be [...] "indemnified" [...] against the loss covered in the policy.|$|E

50|$|Structured finance is {{a sector}} of finance {{that was created}} to help <b>transfer</b> <b>risk</b> using complex legal and {{corporate}} entities. This transfer of risk, as applied to the securitization of various financial assets (mortgages, credit card receivables, auto loans, etc.), has helped provide increased liquidity or funding sources to markets like housing and to <b>transfer</b> <b>risk</b> to buyers of structured products; it also permits financial institutions to remove certain assets from their balance sheets as well as provides a means for investors {{to gain access to}} diversified asset classes. However, it arguably contributed to the degradation in underwriting standards for these financial assets, which helped give rise to both the inflationary credit bubble of the mid-2000s and the credit crash and Financial crisis of 2007-08.|$|E

50|$|Risks can {{be reduced}} in four main ways: avoidance, diversification, hedging and {{insurance}} by <b>transferring</b> <b>risk.</b> Systematic risk, also called market risk or un-diversifiable risk, is a risk of a security that cannot be reduced through diversification.

50|$|Another way {{insurance}} companies can spread their risk from CAT bonds is to <b>transfer</b> <b>risk</b> to another insurer, thereby re-insuring the original insurer’s portfolio and minimizing liability. A re-insurance policy could assume {{a loss of}} “$10 million above $50 million with 5% participation.” In this scenario, the secondary insurer pledges to pay the policy originator up to 95% of $10 million for any loss above $50 million.|$|E

Accountants, regulators and other constituencies proposed a variety of tests for such transactions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>transfer,</b> {{including}} insurance, {{is widely}} recognized {{as a tool for}} increasing financial resilience to severe weather events such as floods. The application of this mechanism varies widely across countries, with a range of different types and schemes in operation. While most of the analytical focus has so far been on those markets that have a long tradition of insurance, there is still a clear gap in our understanding of how this mechanism works in a developing country context. This paper assesses 27 insurance schemes that <b>transfer</b> the <b>risk</b> of economic losses arising from floods in low—and middle income countries, focusing on the linkages between financial <b>risk</b> <b>transfer</b> and <b>risk</b> reduction. This aspect is important to avoid the effect of moral hazard and has gained particular relevance {{in the context of the}} climate change adaptation discourse, where some scholars and practitioners view insurance as a potential tool not just for current risks, but also to address projected future impacts of a changing climate by incentivizing risk reduction. We therefore look beyond the pure financial <b>risk</b> <b>transfer</b> nature of those 27 insurance schemes and investigate any prevention and risk reduction elements. Our analysis suggests that the potential for utilizing <b>risk</b> <b>transfer</b> for <b>risk</b> reduction is far from exhausted, with only very few schemes showing an operational link between <b>risk</b> <b>transfer</b> and <b>risk</b> reduction, while the effectiveness and implementation on the ground remains unclear. The dearth of linkages between risk reduction and insurance is a missed opportunity in the efforts to address rising risk levels, particularly in the context of climate change. Rising risk levels pose a threat to the insurability of floods, and insurance without risk reduction elements could lead to moral hazard. Therefore a closer linkage between <b>risk</b> <b>transfer</b> and <b>risk</b> reduction could make this a more sustainable and robust tool...|$|R

5000|$|The £1bn deal {{to supply}} up 31 BAES Hawks {{was said to}} be at risk in early 2003 because the MoD wanted to compare the BAES bid with the Italian Aermacchi M-346. [...] The MoD had wanted a leasing deal under the private finance {{initiative}} (PFI), to <b>transfer</b> <b>risk</b> to the contractor rather than buy aircraft outright, with at least 11,000 flying hours a year being required. The upfront costs of developing and building the new aircraft, while waiting for lease payments, were not favoured by BAES, and the first PFI proposal that was submitted in March 2003 was considered too expensive by the Treasury.|$|E

40|$|Optimal <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> {{are derived}} within an {{insurance}} group {{consisting of two}} separate legal entities, operating under potentially different regulatory capital requirements and capital costs. Consistent with regulatory practice, capital requirements for each entity are computed by either a value-at-risk or an expected shortfall risk measure. The optimality criterion consists of minimising the risk-adjusted value of the total group liabilities, with valuation carried out using a cost-of-capital approach. The optimisation problems are analytically solved and it is seen that optimal <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> often involve the <b>transfer</b> of tail <b>risk</b> (unlimited reinsurance layers) to the more weakly regulated entity. We show that, {{in the absence of}} a capital requirement for the credit risk that specifically arises from the <b>risk</b> <b>transfer,</b> optimal <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> achieve capital efficiency at the cost of increasing policyholder deficit. However, when credit risk is properly reflected in the capital requirement, incentives for tail-risk transfers vanish and policyholder welfare is restored...|$|R

Buffett called them 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' A potential problem with derivatives is that they comprise an increasingly larger notional amount of assets which may lead to distortions in the underlying capital and equities markets themselves. Investors begin to look at the derivatives markets to make a decision to buy or sell securities and so what was originally meant to be a market to <b>transfer</b> <b>risk</b> now becomes a leading indicator.(See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002) ...|$|E

50|$|In a 2006 article {{published}} in Health Affairs , Robinson describes {{the landscape of the}} commercial insurance market and some of its potential barriers to growth and sustainability due to increasing external pressure. Some of these barriers to growth include its high dependency on employer-based insurance, inability to use pricing power due to cash rich non-profit Blues plans and the market trend towards consumer driven health benefit designs (also known as high deductible health plans) which <b>transfer</b> <b>risk</b> and reward between the consumer and the plan. What is equally concerning is that during the years 2001 through 2010, the rate of employment-based insurance coverage decreased due to rising health care costs placed on plans and employers. With an inability to strengthen their foothold in the now-decreasing employer based market, Robinson suggests that the commercial insurances’ will use historical trends, perspective and economic principles of healthcare finance to overcome these challenges and sustain their growth in earnings. He also predicts the future earnings and profitability of the commercial health insurance industry to be dependent on their ability to anticipate and work through the political agenda and fiscal policies at both the state and federal levels.|$|E
40|$|This paper shows {{under which}} {{conditions}} debt securitization of banks {{can increase the}} systemic risks in the banking sector. We use a simple model to show how securitization can reduce the individual banks’ economic capital requirements by <b>transferring</b> <b>risks</b> to other market participants. This can increase systemic risks and impact financial stability in two ways. First, if the <b>risks</b> are <b>transferred</b> to unregulated market participants there is less capital in the economy to cover these risks. And second, if banks invest in asset-backed securities, the <b>transferred</b> <b>risk</b> causes interbank linkages to grow. This results in an increasing systematic risk for which the economic capital put aside is insufficient.
