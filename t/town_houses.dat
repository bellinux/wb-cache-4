25|$|Kirkcaldy <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> is a Scandinavian {{influenced}} {{town hall}} located in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland. The current <b>town</b> <b>house</b> was begun in 1937, from a competition-winning design by architects David Carr and William Howard of Edinburgh. Only the foundations {{had been put}} in place before construction was interrupted by the Second World War. Work resumed on the building in 1950 and was completed in two separate phases between 1953 and 1956. The <b>town</b> <b>house</b> would serve as the headquarters of Kirkcaldy Town Council from 1956 to 1975 and then Kirkcaldy District Council from 1975 to 1996.

5|$|Although most residences {{were built}} {{according}} to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of Baroque architecture. Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, {{and a number of}} large <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> modeled after Continental building types were constructed.

50|$|The Roman <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> in Dorchester is a Roman ruin within Colliton Park, Dorchester, Dorset. Dorset County Council {{acquired}} Colliton Park in 1933 as {{the site}} for the construction of County Hall. The <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> was discovered in 1937/38 during an archaeological investigation carried out by the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society prior to the construction of the new building. Plans for County Hall were modified so that the <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> could be retained on site.|$|R
2500|$|A {{decision}} was made to re-locate the <b>town</b> <b>house</b> in the mid-1930s. The former <b>town</b> <b>house</b> on the High Street was demolished in 1935. A site for the new <b>town</b> <b>house</b> was chosen {{to the north of the}} town centre, which involved the demolition of three main villas - Adelaide, St Oalfs and Tilehurst - to make space. Construction of the new <b>town</b> <b>house</b> began in 1939 from a competition-winning design by David Carr and William Howard of Edinburgh. Only the foundations of the building had been put in place before work was interrupted by the Second World War. The nearby Osborne House on East Wemyss Place would serve as a temporary town office, for the time being. Work on the <b>town</b> <b>house</b> resumed in 1950. This was split into two phases: the officers' section and the councillors' section. The first phase (including the officers' section) was opened by James Young, then Secretary of State for Scotland on 6 July 1953. The second and final phase (including the councillors' section and unveiling the statue of [...] "The Sower" [...] by Thomas Whalen) of the building was opened by the town provost, David Wright, on 6 July 1956. The town council had their first meeting in the new building on 12 November 1956. In 1975, the <b>town</b> <b>house</b> became the headquarters of Kirkcaldy District Council. Nowadays, the role of the <b>town</b> <b>house</b> is the headquarters of the central region of Fife Council.|$|R
5|$|Mayfair is a {{residential}} and commercial area dominated by terraces of <b>town</b> <b>houses.</b> In Grosvenor Square there are several memorials with an American theme, including a memorial garden commemorating the September 11 attacks, due to the presence on that square of the US Embassy.

5|$|Rococo {{provided}} {{a brief but}} significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas on}} each side of the marina, {{formerly}} occupied by the two power stations and chemical plant, have been redeveloped to provide a wide range of housing, from <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> to social housing to exclusive flats.

5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} a million people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine <b>town</b> <b>houses,</b> vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E
5|$|The Marquesses of Bute {{acquired}} the castle in 1776. John Stuart, the first marquess, {{took steps to}} protect the ruins. His great-grandson John Crichton-Stuart, the third marquess, was immensely rich {{as the result of}} the family's holdings in the South Wales coalfields and was passionately interested in the medieval period. He had the site fully surveyed by the architect William Frame, and reroofed the great hall in the 1870s. The marquess began a process of buying back leasehold properties around the castle with the intent of clearing back the <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> that had been built up to the edge of the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{market place}} at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on market days. Although many of the buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following a fire in the 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the market place are <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> that were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E

5|$|Vernacular {{architecture}} {{of this period}} continued to dependent on local materials and styles. Often built by groups of friends and family, {{the homes of the}} rural poor were usually of very simple construction. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In the early 1800s urban settings also included traditional thatched houses, beside the larger, stone and slate roofed <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> of merchants and urban gentry.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, <b>town</b> <b>houses,</b> manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham {{was working in}} the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham another opportunity to design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E

The new high rise is slated {{to be completed by}} the end of 2015, and will feature a Tawakal Global Bank customer and financial services center, a large, 338 square meter supermarket, a 46-room luxury hotel, restaurant and coffee shop facilities, and conference and event halls. In addition, the Nabaad Supermarket provides major retail service to local shoppers. Open daily until 10 pm, the convenience chain imports most of its products from the United Arab Emirates and China. The Al Buruuj firm also launched a major real estate project in January 2015, Daru-Salam City. Financed by the Salaam Somali Bank, the new urban complex includes <b>town</b> <b>houses,</b> apartment flats, a mosque, recreational areas, playgrounds, a supermarket and roads.

5|$|After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, {{the city}} was {{drastically}} westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> such as the 1926 Ristiḱ Palace. Architecture of that time {{is very similar to}} the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine train station, both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by Milan Zloković. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange who designed the new train station. Macedonian architects also took part to the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Delčev in 1975, while Janko Konstantinov designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). Slavko Brezovski designed the Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its {{clientele}} diminished, {{and for the first}} time in its existence it began to lose money. It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former chef of the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation; this was achieved by annexing two <b>town</b> <b>houses,</b> joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten-year renovation cost a total of $250million. The restaurants were given a new look, and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier.|$|E
