5000|$|The {{annealing}} process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region {{for a set}} period of time. During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity. The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed into martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition. By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, {{as well as the}} degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled. Depending on processing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. [...] TRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of Austen and bainite in a ferrite matrix. Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region {{for a period of time}} sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse into austenite. The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there. This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product. While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite. This, in turn, lowers the martensite start temperature to below room temperature. Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite). This combination of micro-structures has the added benefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming. This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the <b>TRIP</b> <b>steel</b> is being formed, it becomes much stronger. Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa. Martensitic steels are also high in C and Mn. These are fully quenched to martensite during processing. The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel. Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.|$|E

Multiphase <b>TRIP</b> <b>steels</b> are considered as composite materials with a ferritic matrix containing bainite and retained austenite, which gradually transforms into martensite. The effective properties and overall behavior of <b>TRIP</b> <b>steels</b> are determined by using homogenization techniques for nonlinear composites.

The constitutive model is used also for the calculation of "forming limit diagrams" for sheets made of TRIP steels; it is found that the TRIP phenomenon increases the strain at which local necking results from a gradual localization of the strains at an initial thickness imperfection in the sheet. © 2005 Elsevier B.

The savings in automobile weight is provided by the inherent strength of <b>TRIP</b> <b>steels</b> which allows for the use of thinner sections.

40|$|Multiphase <b>TRIP</b> <b>steels</b> are a {{relatively}} new class of steels exhibiting excellent combinations of strength and cold formability, a fact that renders them particularly attractive for automotive applications. The present work reports models regarding the prediction of the stability of retained austenite, the optimisation of the heat-treatment stages necessary for austenite stabilization in the microstructure, {{as well as the}} mechanical behaviour of these steels under deformation. Austenite stability against mechanically-induced transformation to martensite depends on chemical composition, austenite particle size, strength of the matrix and stress state. The stability of retained austenite is characterized by the M-S(sigma) temperature, which can be expressed {{as a function of the}} aforementioned parameters by an appropriate model presented in this work. Besides stability, the mechanical behaviour of <b>TRIP</b> <b>steels</b> also depends on the amount of retained austenite present in the microstructure. This amount is determined by the combinations of temperature and temporal duration of the heat-treatment stages undergone by the steel. Maximum amounts of retained austenite require optimisation of the heat-treatment conditions. A physical model is presented in this work, which is based on the interactions between bainite and austenite during the heat-treatment of multiphase <b>TRIP</b> <b>steels,</b> and which allows for the selection of treatment conditions leading to the maximization of retained austenite in the final microstructure. Finally, a constitutive micromechanical model is presented, which describes the mechanical behaviour of multiphase <b>TRIP</b> <b>steels</b> under deformation, taking into account the different plastic behaviour of the individual phases, as well as the evolution of the microstructure itself during plastic deformation.
