She was the blonde princess depicted in Diego Velázquez' masterpiece Las Meninas. The wonderful series of Velazquez portraits of <b>this</b> <b>lovely</b> Spanish princess at various stages of her childhood were sent from the court of Madrid to Leopold as he waited in Vienna for his fiancee to grow up. This beautiful girl, the representation of merry childhood, was married at fifteen. She gave birth to four children and finally {{died at the age}} of twenty-one.|$|E

500|$|K. M. Munshi had {{a totally}} {{different}} take on the myth in his Krishnavatara series. Though Putana came with evil intentions, she is portrayed as being happy to see Krishna and her maternal instinct rises, telling her [...] "Take <b>this</b> <b>lovely</b> boy to your breast. You are a wicked and miserable woman. You have never seen joy before, joy which thrills your whole body and mind with mad delight." [...] Overjoyed and forgetful of her poisoned breasts, she took Krishna {{in her lap and}} suckled him. In the process, she surrenders to Krishna saying [...] "I give you all, my beloved child... I am yours." [...] Further, Putana is purified and liberated from her mortal body by Krishna.|$|E

500|$|The {{second volume}} of the manga was {{positively}} reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: [...] "With its second volume the title pushes fully {{into the realm of}} romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side that will keep you coming back." [...] In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, [...] "The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less." [...] In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, [...] "these volumes offer a solid conclusion to <b>this</b> <b>lovely</b> little yuri series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking." ...|$|E

[...] "It certainly imitated alcoholism in every superficial way," [...] he recalled in 1983. [...] "She'd fly into these rages, never at me, never once, always at Harry Cohn or her father or her mother or her brother. She would break all the furniture and she'd get {{in a car and}} I'd have to get in the car and try to control her. She'd drive up in the hills suicidally. Terrible, terrible nights. And I just saw <b>this</b> <b>lovely</b> girl destroying herself. I admire Yasmin so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 {{they won}} the CARA in the {{categories}} [...] "Best classical album" [...] with Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland and also the second prize with Incessament, they won in the category [...] "Best classical song" [...] with Sanctus Incessament and second prize with Sic Deus Dilexit. Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland {{is a collection of}} music for Advent and Christmas around Veni redemptor gentium in settings of Ambrosius of Milan and Michael Praetorius, Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland of Johann Eccard, and compositions of Jacobus Vaet, Philipp Dulichius, Heinrich Isaac and Hildegard of Bingen, among others. Incessament features music of Pierre de la Rue, especially his Missa Incessament, a five-part canonic mass ordinary, also known as Missa Sic deus & Non salvatur rex, La Rue's longest mass cycle. A review on this first recording of the work remarked:"However, the Ensemble Amarcord itself deserves full credit for its breathtakingly smooth blend and celestial sweetness of tone. As with the Brumel work on the disc previously discussed, this is a worldpremiere recording of <b>this</b> <b>lovely</b> and important piece." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{contrast}} {{between them is}} perhaps most forcibly realised when Gloucester dies in Act 3, Scene 2. Margaret makes a speech in which she points out how it is unfair to accuse Suffolk of the murder simply because Suffolk and Gloucester were enemies, as she and Gloucester's wife were enemies too, so if Suffolk is a suspect, so should she be one as well; [...] "Ay me unhappy,/To be a queen, and crowned with infamy" [...] (70–71). Again, she is turning events to focus on herself. Henry however, completely ignores her, calling out sorrowfully; [...] "Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man" [...] (72). This situation is repeated during the Cade rebellion, but this time they ignore one another. After the rebels deliver their terms to Henry, he tells Buckingham he will speak with Cade, but Margaret is concerned only with herself and Suffolk (whose head she is now carrying). Speaking to the head she ignores Henry's problems and exclaims, [...] "Ah barbarous villain! Hath <b>this</b> <b>lovely</b> face/Ruled like a wandering planet over me,/And could it not enforce them to relent,/That were unworthy to behold the same?" [...] (4.4.14–17). Henry however ignores this, and continues {{to deal with the}} rebel demands, saying simply, [...] "Lord Saye, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head" [...] (4.4.18). This tendency for them to ignore one another is another example of their incompatibility, their failure to unite in thoughts.|$|E
