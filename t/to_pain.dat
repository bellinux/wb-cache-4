5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling.

Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E

5|$|In {{osteochondritis}} dissecans, {{fragments of}} cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits.

5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that the cerebellum is involved in pain processing. The cerebellum receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar pathways, through the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the motor system inducing a conscious motor avoidance of pain, graded according <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> intensity.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain.

The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave Ludlow Castle {{and most}} of the {{surrounding}} estates to Hugh's niece, Sybil, marrying her <b>to</b> <b>Pain</b> fitzJohn, one of his household staff. Pain used Ludlow as his caput, the main castle in his estates, using the surrounding estates and knight's fees to support the castle and its defences. Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering a struggle for the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who had been planning to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy's son. By now, King Stephen had seized the English throne, but his position was insecure and he therefore gave Ludlow to fitzMiles in 1137, in exchange for promises of future political support.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Previous {{research}} has shown that sensitivity <b>to</b> movement-evoked <b>pain</b> is associated with higher scores on self-report measures of disability in individuals who have sustained whiplash injuries. However, it remains unclear whether sensitivity <b>to</b> movement-evoked <b>pain</b> is associated with work-disability. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the relation between sensitivity <b>to</b> movement-evoked <b>pain</b> and occupational status in individuals receiving treatment for whiplash injury. Methods A sample of 105 individuals with whiplash injuries participated in a testing session where different measures of pain (i. e. spontaneous pain, multi-site <b>pain,</b> sensitivity <b>to</b> movement-evoked <b>pain)</b> were collected during the performance of a simulated occupational lifting task. Results Hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed that the measures of multisite <b>pain</b> and sensitivity <b>to</b> movement-evoked <b>pain</b> made significant independent contributions to the prediction of work-disability. Discussion The findings suggest that including measures of multisite <b>pain</b> and sensitivity <b>to</b> movement evoked <b>pain</b> in assessment protocols has the potential to increase the value of pain assessments for the prediction of occupational disability associated with whiplash injury. Clinical and theoretical implications of the findings are addressed...|$|R
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Lameness in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> in {{any part of}} the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. Lameness can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop lameness, trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the season}} started, however, Orr {{underwent}} another surgery on September 20, 1975. The Bruins' contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins' insurer would not insure {{a contract with}} Orr and doctors advised the Bruins that Orr {{would not be able}} to play much longer. Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due <b>to</b> <b>pain</b> in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
