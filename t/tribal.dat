5|$|The <b>Tribal</b> Assembly (comitia populi tributa) of the Roman Republic was the {{democratic}} assembly of Roman citizens. The <b>Tribal</b> Assembly was organized as an Assembly, {{and not as}} a Council. During the years of the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of thirty-five Tribes which included patricians and plebeians. The Tribes gathered into the <b>Tribal</b> Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The president of the <b>Tribal</b> Assembly was usually either a Consul (the highest ranking Roman Magistrate) or a Praetor (the second-highest ranking Roman Magistrate). The <b>Tribal</b> Assembly elected three different magistrates: Quaestors, Curule Aediles, and Military Tribunes. The <b>Tribal</b> Assembly also had the power to try judicial cases.|$|E

While Indian reservations typical {{in most of the}} United States are not present in Oklahoma, <b>tribal</b> governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. <b>Tribal</b> governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over <b>tribal</b> members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The <b>tribal</b> governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish <b>tribal</b> {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity.

5|$|In December 1831 Yagan and {{his father}} led the first {{significant}} Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan's family group. A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began {{to break through the}} mud-brick walls. Inside were Butler's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph. After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo. Noongar <b>tribal</b> law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's <b>tribal</b> group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees {{to be part of the}} settlers' groups. Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their <b>tribal</b> law. Not understanding <b>tribal</b> law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan's group, without success.|$|E

5000|$|Company {{officials}} apprehending {{spread of}} resentment tried to subdue the <b>tribals</b> and took Rindo Majhi under custody. In order to suppress and to pressurise the <b>tribals</b> Rindo Majhi was moved from village to village in chains. However instead of suppressing the <b>tribals</b> it infuriated {{them and they}} forcefully released their leader from bondage. There after open war between <b>tribals</b> and east India Company started. There was large numbers of casualties {{from the side of}} company forces. However the traditional weapons of the <b>tribals</b> could not match with the superior arms with gun power of British. At last, Rindo Majhi alongwith 13 followers met martyrdom facing gun shots in the last war near Urladani of Kalahandi. The historians lament that the struggle and sacrifice of Rindo Majhi is yet to be given due recognition by the government and he is yet to get martyr status. Moreover, his work place in Urladani, Mohangiri and Manikera gram panchayats are also remaining neglected raising question marks on the sincerity of the government.|$|R

5|$|Sir Henry Spelman was {{the first}} to publish the <b>Tribal</b> Hidage in his first volume of Glossarium Archaiologicum (1626) and there is also a version of the text in a book written in 1691 by Thomas Gale, but no actual {{discussion}} of the <b>Tribal</b> Hidage emerged until 1848, when John Mitchell Kemble's The Saxons in England was published. In 1884, Walter de Gray Birch wrote a paper for the British Archaeological Society, in which he discussed in detail the location of each of the tribes. The term <b>Tribal</b> Hidage was introduced by Frederic William Maitland in 1897, in his book Domesday Book and Beyond. During the following decades, articles were published by William John Corbett (1900), Hector Munro Chadwick (1905) and John Brownbill (1912 and 1925). The most important subsequent accounts of the <b>Tribal</b> Hidage since Corbett, according to Campbell, are by Josiah Cox Russell (1947), Cyril Hart (1971), Wendy Davies and Hayo Vierck (1974) and David Dumville (1989).|$|E
