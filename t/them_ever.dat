5|$|Chuck and Sarah turn to Jack to {{help them}} {{continue}} Daphne's con and capture the Zephyr. They manage to lead the Klügs away from the reception and incapacitate them, {{only to find that}} none of them has the Zephyr. Jack realizes that the Klügs have been performing a shell game: the government has been pursuing them for the Zephyr when none of <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> had it; their father (Timothy V. Murphy) had it all along. Meanwhile, the bride's father realizes he is being conned and leads Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) away at gunpoint. When Chuck and Sarah confront him, Klüg uses Morgan as a human shield, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) takes aim at his head. However, Jack manages to talk Klüg down {{for the sake of the}} bride's happiness.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best in NBA history as it produced seven Hall of Famers and twelve All-Stars. Three of the first four picks were inducted to the Hall of Fame and seven of the first eight picks became All-Stars. The 1970 Draft is also known as the first draft where international players who had never played U.S. high school and college basketball were selected. In the 10th and 11th round, the Atlanta Hawks drafted Mexican Manuel Raga and Italian Dino Meneghin; both were playing in the Italian league at the time. They became the first two international players drafted to the NBA. However, neither of <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> played in the league as the Hawks did not have US$35,000 to buy out either of their contracts with their teams. Meneghin, who played 28 seasons in Italy, has been inducted by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to the FIBA Hall of Fame and also to the Basketball Hall of Fame.|$|E

25|$|Nina Gordon left Veruca Salt {{in early}} 1998. Post kept the Veruca Salt name because the pair had an {{agreement}} that if one of <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> left the band the other would get to continue using the name. Resolver was released in 2000, the first Gordon-less Veruca Salt album.|$|E

25|$|In 1806, Cambrian {{came under}} the command of Captain John Nairne (acting). While under his command she, along with Leander and the ship-sloop , was engaged in searching American vessels coming from foreign ports, for enemy {{property}} and contraband. This gave rise to the so-called Leander affair with the result that on 14 June President Thomas Jefferson issued a proclamation ordering Leander, Driver, and Cambrian immediately to quit US waters and forbidding <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> to return. He extended the same prohibition to all vessels that their respective captains might command. On 26 April, the day after the affair, Leander, Cambrian, and Driver captured the American ship Aurora.|$|E
25|$|Dureza, a dark-skinned grape variety {{from the}} Ardèche region in France, {{has all but}} {{disappeared}} from the vineyards, and the preservation of such varieties is a speciality of Montpellier. Mondeuse blanche is a white grape variety cultivated in the Savoy region, and is still found in very small amounts in that region's vineyards today. Both varieties are somewhat obscure today, and have never achieved anything near Syrah's fame or popularity, {{and there is no}} record of <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> having been cultivated at long distances from their present homes. Thus, both of Syrah's parents come from a limited area in southeastern France, very close to northern Rhône. Based on these findings, the researchers have concluded Syrah originated from northern Rhône.|$|E

A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E
