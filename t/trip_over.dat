5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons.

5|$|Trial runs {{were carried}} out from November 1861 while {{construction}} was still under way. The first <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> the whole line was in May 1862 with William Gladstone among the guests. By the end of 1862 work was complete {{at a cost of}} £1.3 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{wanted to}} secure the {{southern}} borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy. As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piedmont, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert. For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes. Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although {{he had yet to}} be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation. Alais made the <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.|$|E
5|$|They found {{albatross}} chicks {{and seals}} to eat, {{but despite the}} relative comfort of the island compared to the small boat, they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at Husvik {{on the other side}} of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island. It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue, so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird, and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> the mountains. McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice. He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach, but it proved too clumsy to be practical. When Shackleton's party set off on 18 May 1916, McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further. He shook hands with each of the men, wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back. Putting McNish in command of the remaining men, Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast. Once Shackleton's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's ships, Samson, to pick up McNish and the other men. After seeing the emaciated and drawn McNish on his arrival at the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the rescue had come just in time for him.|$|E

25|$|Newland toured England in 1905 as {{a reserve}} wicket-keeper and {{understudy}} to Jim Kelly. While in the United Kingdom {{he played in}} 10 first-class matches with the Australian team, but could only score 67 runs at 9.57 and effect 13 dismissals. His disappointing performances may have been {{as a result of}} an eye injury he received during the <b>trip</b> <b>over,</b> which was bad enough that he had to see an oculist in London. He had earlier, in 1904/05, toured New Zealand and played two matches against the national team. At that stage, New Zealand weren't a Test playing country so the matches had only first-class status.|$|E
25|$|Instead, Grover Robbins, an {{entrepreneur}} from Blowing Rock, North Carolina, purchased Autry's option {{and bought the}} locomotive in August, 1955. Robbins moved the #12 locomotive back to its native Blue Ridge Mountains {{as the centerpiece of}} a new “Tweetsie Railroad“ tourist attraction. One mile of track was constructed near Blowing Rock, North Carolina for the train to run on, and on July 4, 1957, the locomotive made its first public <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> the line. In 1958, the track was extended to a 3-mile loop around the mountain, and the trains at Tweetsie have traveled that loop ever since. Grover Robbins' brothers, Harry and Spencer, were also involved with the operation of Tweetsie Railroad, and the park is still operated by the Robbins family.|$|E
25|$|A second {{enduring}} legend {{claims a}} huge army of knights sleep inside Blaník, a {{mountain in the}} Czech Republic. The knights will awake and, {{under the command of}} St. Wenceslaus, bring aid to the Czech people when they face ultimate danger (see also King in the mountain legends). There is a similar legend in Prague which says that when the Motherland is in danger or in its darkest times and close to ruin, the equestrian statue of King Wenceslaus in Wenceslaus Square will come to life, raise the army sleeping in Blaník, and upon crossing the Charles Bridge his horse will stumble and <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> a stone, revealing the legendary sword of Bruncvík. With this sword, King Wenceslaus will slay all the enemies of the Czechs, bringing peace and prosperity to the land. Ogden Nash wrote a comic epic poem—"The Christmas that Almost Wasn't", loosely based on the same legend—in which a boy awakens Wenceslaus and his knights to save a kingdom from usurpers who have outlawed Christmas.|$|E

500|$|A {{limitation}} {{of these and}} similar devices has been their poor depth perception (the user {{has a hard time}} judging how far away objects are). [...] This increases the likelihood that the user will <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> or run into obstacles, or have other distance-related problems. [...] An additional {{limitation of}} infrared technology is that since materials at the same temperature are shown as the same color, the display will not depict many details normally viewable in visible light.|$|E
500|$|For many years, Weinberg's gear {{included}} Ludwig and Pearl Drums and Zildjian cymbals; he subsequently {{switched to}} DW Drums, but continues to use Zildjian cymbals. He also uses Remo heads and previously using Regal Tip drumsticks and brushes, he now uses Vater drumsticks, notably the 5A Nude wood tip model and Wire Tap brushes. His setup {{has always been}} simple, mostly consisting of a snare drum, mounted tom, bass drum and floor tom while his usual cymbal setup consists of two crash cymbals, a ride cymbal {{and a pair of}} hi-hats, with an occasional third crash: [...] "I've got four drums.

500|$|The other {{important}} introduction were the mountains.

Desgrange accepted it, saying that Steinès would take the blame if the mountains would be too hard to climb. In the two previous editions, the highest point was the Col de la République at [...] In 1905, Desgrange chose to overlook this, and focused instead on {{the introduction of the}} Ballon d'Alsace, because he saw that he had missed the opportunity for publicity previously.|$|E
500|$|The Boston Globe's Frederic M. Biddle {{gave the}} episode {{one and a}} half stars and commented [...] "Carey always keeps you watching, {{although}} he's always threatening to be funnier than he is. But more than any other Friends ripoff, this show's supporting actors slow down the central character – they're set decoration. Comic scenes involving the full cast build, then <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> themselves." [...] Alan Pergament, writing for The Buffalo News, included The Drew Carey Show in his Top 10 new shows, noting [...] "Carey is a lovable goof and his male buddy show has the chance of becoming the male version of Designing Women." [...] Pergament cited the lack of prominent female characters and [...] "a reliance on too many risque-language jokes" [...] as the weaknesses of the show. The Washington Post's Tom Shales found the episode funny, adding [...] "The Drew Carey Show bucks all the prevailing sitcom trends and does it endearingly." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Director Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. In the climactic scene Gillan had to walk with her eyes closed, which she said was difficult and challenging as the ground was uneven and muddy. She stated that [...] "it was the most scary thing" [...] when she had to <b>trip</b> <b>over</b> a step and fall, even though she was aware of the crash mat. As she was not able to express herself through her eyes, Gillan had to make herself more animated to convey emotion. The scene in which the Doctor, Amy and River are horizontal in mid-air when the gravity field fails on the Byzantium was achieved by using wires and powerful wind machines. The blue in Amy's bedroom was an idea of Adam Smith to show that it was inspired by the TARDIS from Amy's encounter with the Doctor when she was young.|$|E
