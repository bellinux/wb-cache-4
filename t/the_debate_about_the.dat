His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV ("Jack") graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{origin of}} Indo-Aryan peoples is {{controversial}} in the Indian subcontinent.

Institutional change is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.|$|E

A proposition included in the programme of the Prodi I Cabinet in 1997 had to be withdrawn because of the opposition from the Commission for Constitutional Affairs.

His main assertion was that Mortensen's observation had not been investigated more carefully. The media also reported that the cause of the accident had never been found and that a damaged Harrier had landed in Tromsø the day of the accident.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case between {{representatives from}} the social {{sciences}} and natural sciences has continued in the popular press and in media. In 2007, the controversy resulted in a book by science journalist Vanna Beckman, with a focus on the larger issues of biologism and sociologism as they played out in the debate, a book which also described the ideological battle against research in psychology and psychiatry driven by various religious groups. In April 2008, a hotly debated television documentary aired on Swedish television, where Kärfve and Erlinder returned to the spotlight to air their concerns about the shredding of the documents.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution also {{concerns}} the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have {{stressed the importance of}} natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution. Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain's industrial output.|$|E

25|$|But {{the most}} troubled era for the tram service in Trondheim {{was in the}} 1980s, when {{the future of the}} tram was one of the hottest {{political}} issues in Trondheim, resulting in several mayors having to leave office. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future of the trams had been going on through the late 1970s, in general with {{the left side of the}} city council supporting the tram while the right side wanted to close it down. After the city council election in 1979 the Progress Party got its first representative in the city council, Hildur Karstensen, who was a tram driver for TT. Though the Conservative mayor, Axel Buch, was expected to be re-elected, Kristiansen chose to support the Labour candidate Olav Gjærevoll, in the hope that a socialist majority would ensure the future of the trams, and thus making Gjærevoll mayor.|$|E
