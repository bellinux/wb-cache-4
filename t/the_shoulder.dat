5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan {{rhinoceros}} are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E
5000|$|The middle {{trapezius}} and rhomboids {{engage to}} open the chest and keep <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> wide and back. The lower trapezius also brings <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> downward, away from the ears.|$|R
25|$|Pelerines, tippets, or lace {{coverings}} {{draped over}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> were popular (one of several devices, along with full upper-arm sleeves and wide necklines, to emphasize <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and their width).|$|R
25|$|Since {{idiopathic}} scoliosis and its surgery {{affect the}} vertebrae and the joints along the spine, {{the range of}} motion {{is expected to be}} different between patients and non-scoliotic people. There is a hypothesis that states that the vertebral column behaves like a torsional spring: while walking, the angular momentum of <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> compensates <b>the</b> angular momentum of the pelvis (i.e. when <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> rotate clockwise, <b>the</b> pelvis rotates counterclockwise; when the pelvis rotates clockwise, <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> rotate counterclockwise). As scoliosis perturbs the architecture of <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> spine and pelvis, gait also differs between patients and non-scoliotic people.|$|R
5|$|Nighthawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. Each train has six cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 24 riders. Riders are restrained by an over <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> restraint and a lap bar. Riders can put on the over <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> restraint but a ride operator will push down the lap bar. While in the station, the trains will recline back to the laying down position.|$|E

50|$|When {{entering}} the pose, {{it may be}} easier to let <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> roll forward/upward and open the back (abducting the scapulea), but as the pose deepens <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> can relax down and back (adducting the scapulea).|$|R

5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|After several {{successful}} missions, including dumping {{his girlfriend}} {{with the help}} of Fox, Wesley has an unexpected shootout with Cross, wherein he accidentally kills the Exterminator, a Fraternity member he had befriended. Cross shoots Wesley in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Sloan grants Wesley's wish to avenge his father and sends him after Cross—but then secretly gives Fox a mission to kill Wesley, saying that his name has come up in the Loom.|$|E
5|$|Americans define <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> angle at alpha/2 ≈ 35 degrees. The common rifling {{twist rate}} for this {{cartridge}} is 1:228.6mm (1:9 in), 8 grooves, Ø lands = 5.53mm, Ø grooves = 5.62mm, land width = 1.63mm and the recommended primer type is small rifle.|$|E

50|$|Dislocations of <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> or hip joints are {{sometimes}} performed as a short novelty act by itself. One example is lifting the {{arm to the}} side until it passes behind the head and lies {{across the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A shimmy is a dance move {{in which}} the body is held still, except for <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> which are quickly alternated back and forth. When <b>the</b> right <b>shoulder</b> goes back, <b>the</b> left one comes forward. It may help to hold the arms out {{slightly}} bent at the elbow, and when <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> are moved, keep the hands in the same position.|$|R
5|$|Breathing gas {{containers}} for offshore use may be coded and marked according to IMCA D043. IMCA colour coding for individual cylinders allows {{the body of}} the cylinder to be any colour that is not likely to cause misinterpretation of the hazard identified by the colour code of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} Bactrian camel, the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
60|$|The bound-up body {{began to}} {{struggle}} again. She watched fascinated the muscles working, <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>the</b> hips, the large, clean thighs. Even now he might break the ropes. She was afraid. But the lively young soldier sat on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of <b>the</b> bound man, {{and after a}} few perilous moments, there was stillness again.|$|R
50|$|In the book, Bob Young of Red Hat {{supports}} the free software movement {{by saying that}} it enables people to stand on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of giants. He also says that standing on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of giants {{is the opposite of}} reinventing the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Halo: The kettlebell {{is held by}} {{the horns}} in front of <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> usually upside-down, and moved {{in a circle around}} the head while keeping the head {{straight}} in place. This movement is done to improve mobility of <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and triceps.|$|R
5|$|In {{almost all}} {{drawings}} and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined {{at both the}} hip and <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 327/326BC, Alexander {{personally}} led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the next day's game, a tearful Joyce met Galarraga at home plate to receive the Tigers' lineup card. The two shook hands and Joyce gave the pitcher a pat on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> with a warm {{reception}} from the audience. Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning the unfortunate situation into a positive.|$|E
5000|$|... {{these are}} similar to boat necklines but are {{significantly}} lower, below <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and collar bone.
