40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} describing the variations of the language forms, describing the different expression between male and female, and describing the equivalence of the implicature pattern of compliment utterances on Legally Blonde movie and its translation. In collecting the data, the writer uses documentation method. In analyzing the compliment utterances and its translation, the steps are: finding the variation of forms of utterances by applying language form theory, finding {{the differences in the}} way male and female expressing the compliment utterances by applying four types politeness strategy of Brown and Levinson, and describing the equivalences of the implicature by applying Grice theory. Having analyzed the data, the writer finds that the forms of compliment utterances and its translation are word is <b>translated</b> into word; noun phrase is <b>translated</b> into word; noun phrase is <b>translated</b> into noun phrase; noun phrase is <b>translated</b> into declarative sentence; simple declarative sentence is <b>translated</b> into word; simple declarative sentence is <b>translated</b> into adjective phrase; simple declarative sentence is <b>translated</b> into simple declarative sentence; negative declarative sentence is <b>translated</b> into negative declarative sentence; compound sentence us <b>translated</b> into compound sentence; compound sentence is <b>translated</b> into simple declarative sentence; interrogative sentence is <b>translated</b> into interrogative sentence; negative interrogative sentence is <b>translated</b> into declarative sentence; negative interrogative sentence is <b>translated</b> into negative interrogative sentence; and exclamatory sentence is <b>translated</b> into adjective phrase.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are {{expressed in terms of}} infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the calculations can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can <b>translate</b> difficult calculations in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier calculations in the B-model. These calculations are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to <b>translate</b> calculations in one theory into equivalent calculations in a different theory. By outsourcing calculations to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.|$|E
