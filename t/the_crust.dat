5|$|Lead is {{classified}} as a chalcophile under the Goldschmidt classification, meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur. It rarely occurs in its native, metallic form. Many lead minerals are relatively light and, {{over the course of}} the Earth's history, have remained in <b>the</b> <b>crust</b> instead of sinking deeper into the Earth's interior. This accounts for lead's relatively high crustal abundance of 14 ppm; it is the 38th most abundant element in <b>the</b> <b>crust.</b>|$|E
5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through <b>the</b> <b>crust</b> is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world.

5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below <b>the</b> <b>crust</b> when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather <b>the</b> <b>crust.</b> These metals otherwise occur in <b>the</b> <b>crust,</b> in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E

5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens <b>the</b> <b>crust.</b> Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling <b>the</b> <b>crust.</b>|$|E

5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between <b>the</b> <b>crust</b> and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} is developed to evaluate <b>the</b> rates of <b>crust</b> generation and hence the quantities of incompatible elements processed through <b>the</b> continental <b>crust</b> over <b>the</b> last 4 Ga. This relies more on minor and trace elements, and residence times in <b>the</b> upper <b>crust</b> and less on radiogenic isotopes since the latter constrain the stabilisation of continental <b>crust</b> rather than <b>the</b> rates of <b>crust</b> generation. In this model, the composition of new material added to <b>the</b> continental <b>crust</b> is similar to estimates of the average lower continental <b>crust.</b> <b>The</b> median composition of granitic magmas with Eu/Eu* = 0. 7 is strikingly {{similar to that of}} <b>the</b> average upper <b>crust</b> and, in <b>the</b> simplest model, this represents not, vert, similar 14 % melting or 86 % fractional crystallisation of new crust. For an upper crust of 12. 5 km thickness, there would be 77 km of complementary residue, for which there is scant geological evidence. It is therefore inferred that the residence times of elements in <b>the</b> lower <b>crust</b> is much less than in <b>the</b> upper <b>crust.</b> <b>The</b> annual flux of material into <b>the</b> upper <b>crust</b> can be inferred from its volume and the residence times of elements in <b>the</b> upper <b>crust.</b> A maximum value of the latter is provided by the model Nd age of <b>the</b> upper <b>crust</b> of 2 Ga, indicating that the average rates of crust generation are in excess of six times those in the recent geologic past and two to three times greater than the rates inferred from radiogenic isotopes.
