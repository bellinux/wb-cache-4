5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} siding was provided for train stabling, converging {{from the left}} onto the northbound line {{just south of the}} station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box {{at the south end of}} the platform) to simplify through running. <b>The</b> <b>siding</b> lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|E
5|$|A small siding {{immediately}} west of {{the station}} originally led to a stable, which housed the Tramway's horses. After the line's mechanisation in 1872 the stables were closed, and <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> served a small cattle pen.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. <b>The</b> <b>siding</b> is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. <b>The</b> <b>siding</b> tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a week of}} Disneyland's {{opening on}} July 17, 1955, a {{brakeman}} pulled the switch connecting the Disneyland Railroad's main line with a siding at Main Street, U.S.A. Station too soon as the Retlaw 2 freight train on <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> was passing the Retlaw 1 passenger train stopped at the station on the main line. The caboose {{on the end of}} the freight train had not made it fully across the switch when it was pulled, and as a result the caboose's front set of wheels correctly traveled along <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> while the rear set of wheels incorrectly traveled along the main line towards the passenger train, causing the caboose to swing to the side before colliding with a concrete slab and derailing upon impact. During the ensuing commotion, the erring brakeman, presumably to avoid disciplinary action, quietly left the scene of the accident, exited the park, and was not seen again. No injuries were reported, and by the following year the use of sidings at stations on the DRR's main line came to an end.|$|E
5|$|The Kingswood branch {{was again}} not upgraded, and still {{retained}} its 1871 track. It was abandoned {{at the end}} of 1915, and the track removed in 1920. In 1911 Brill Brick and Tile Works closed, and <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> to the brickworks was removed, {{with the exception of the}} rails on the level crossing which in 1984 were still in place, albeit tarmacked over. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Brill became a centre for training cadets, who were housed in Wotton House and ferried in trains of five passenger coaches.|$|E
5|$|The line {{of route}} runs {{parallel}} to the West Somerset Railway from Watchet to Washford where it forms a foot and cycle path. Washford station has been demolished and a bungalow is on the site. The line then curves south west, partly {{in the form of}} a road, past Cleeve Abbey and Roadwater, where the station buildings survive with an extension to form a bungalow. The line continues to Comberow. <b>The</b> <b>siding</b> group that was at the foot of the incline is clearly identifiable at Comberow, to the west of the bridge that carried the incline, as is the station master's house and traces of the platform. Part of the line northwards from there seems to be a footpath.|$|E

5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) says <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> to the brickworks {{opened with}} the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{damage was}} {{reported}} in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the Hudson River, the tornado entered Westchester County, where {{the worst of the}} damage took place. It struck the town of Sleepy Hollow, damaging roofs and tearing <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of Pocantico Hills was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a tornado warning was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Mole {{sides are}} sloped whilst the {{south-east}} face is vertically walled. Originally three {{sides of the}} Mole served coal hoists and their related rail sidings linking them and there were cranes on the south-east face, also rail-served. The former hoist brick-faced plinths are still present (2017) around the north-west and east faces as are those {{on the rest of}} the two docks. In the twilight years of tanker unloading for the William Cory (Powell Duffryn) oilworks, short footbridges were provided from the Mole for works staff to access the brick plinths for the purpose of handling the flexible tanker oil discharge piping and supports and it was not unknown for rail tank wagons to be in use on <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> serving the north-west Mole face.|$|E

5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for <b>the</b> <b>siding,</b> and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E

The two-tier cast iron square water tank stands on timber supports, with its {{disconnected}} jib lying underneath. The skillion- roofed sand shed is clad in corrugated iron, with two doors at the front, and stands on concrete base walls.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before radio, {{dispatching}} locomotives involved using whatever means of communication were available. The BR maintained a helper station at a siding between Dellwood and Lanes Mills, south of Brockwayville. The 700 series Mallets stationed here were required to assist coal trains up to McMinn Summit. When this was necessary, the dispatcher would call the crew to work by ringing a phone booth located next to <b>the</b> <b>siding.</b> A loud bell generally sufficed to wake up the engine crew. On those occasions when it did not, the dispatcher would call the McMinn farm nearby, {{and one of the}} McMinn children would run over to <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> to awaken the engineer and fireman.|$|E
