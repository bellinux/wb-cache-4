5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged <b>that</b> <b>senior</b> sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E

5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters <b>that</b> <b>senior</b> producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 a {{commission}} {{was created to}} look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming {{three of the five}} divisions of the Supreme Court; this was not designed to be permanent, but rather to avoid having to retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a single head of the Supreme Court, as this would have violated the constitutional principle <b>that</b> <b>senior</b> justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of England respectively both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions of the Supreme Court into a single division, the Queen's Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and became Lord Chief Justice of England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the Exchequer of Pleas formally ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons of}} security, Sturmabteilung Koch was {{dispersed}} around several {{locations in the}} Rhineland until it received orders for the operation against Fort Eben-Emael and the three bridges to begin. Preliminary orders were received on 9 May, ordering the separated detachments {{to move to a}} pre-arranged concentration area, and shortly afterwards a second order arrived, informing the assault force that Fall Gelb was to begin at 05:25 on 10 May. At 04:30, forty-two gliders carrying the 493 airborne troops that formed the assault force were lifted off from two airfields in Cologne, the armada of gliders and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives. The aircraft maintained strict radio silence, forcing the pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards Belgium; the radio silence also ensured <b>that</b> <b>senior</b> commanders of the assault force could not be informed that the tow-ropes on one of the gliders had snapped, forcing the glider to land inside Germany. The pilot of a second glider released his tow-rope prematurely, and was unable to land near its objective. Both gliders were carrying troops assigned to Group Granite and were destined to assault Fort Eben-Emael, thereby leaving the group understrength; it also left it under the command of Oberleutnant Witzig's second-in-command, as Witzig was in one of the gliders forced to land. The remaining gliders were released from their tow-ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of , which was deemed high enough for the gliders to land by the three bridges and on top of the fort, and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly. After the Ju-52's released the gliders and began turning away, Belgian anti-aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire. This alerted the defences in the area to the presence of the gliders.|$|E

40|$|Medicare Part D {{provides}} {{prescription drug}} coverage through Medicare approved plans offered by private insurance companies and HMOs. In this paper, we study the role of current prescription drug use and health risks, related expectations, and subjective factors in the demand for prescription drug insurance. To characterize rational behavior in the cmplex Part D environment, we develop an intertemporal optimization model of enrollment decisions. We generally find <b>that</b> <b>senior's</b> choices respond to the incentives provided by their own health status and the market environment as predicted by the optimization model. The proportion on individuals who do not attain the optimal choice is small, but the margin for errors is also small since enrollment is transparently optimal for most eligible seniors. Further, {{there is also evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>seniors</b> over-react to some salient features of the choice situation, do not take full account of the future benefit and cost consequences of their decicsions, or the expected net benefits and risk properties of alternative plans...|$|R
40|$|The Bush {{administration}} advocates its January 2003 {{proposal to}} repeal personal dividend taxation {{on the basis}} that the cut would stimulate the economy, primarily benefit American seniors, and eliminate an unfair case of "double taxation. " This paper primarily analyzes the proposal using a different criterion - its distributional impacts. Contrary to the administration's claim <b>that</b> <b>seniors</b> receive over half of all dividend income, U. S. Census Bureau data indicate <b>that</b> <b>seniors</b> receive only about one-quarter of dividend income. Dividend income is more concentrated towards high- income tax filers than the distribution of U. S. income as a whole. About two-thirds of dividend income accrues to the top 10 % of tax filers. Less than one-fifth of tax filers with adjusted gross incomes of less than $ 75, 000 have any dividend income at all. Also, dividend income is highly skewed by race - only 8 % of blacks and 6 % of Hispanics receive dividend income. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{relationships}} <b>that</b> <b>seniors</b> (aged 55 and above) experience with prescription pharmaceutical brands, thus attending to situations where consumers have limited control over brand choice. Design/methodology/approach - A phenomenological study was conducted involving interviews with seniors in two Canadian cities. Phenomenology relies on a small number of interviews that are analyzed in depth and describes the lived consumer experience. Data analysis focused on types of relationships participants had experienced with brands and factors that influenced relationships. Findings - Analysis reveals four types of relationships <b>that</b> <b>seniors</b> hold with prescription pharmaceutical brands. The interpersonal relationship metaphor of arranged marriages can be used to describe relationship forms <b>that</b> <b>seniors</b> develop with brands. The quality of relationship seniors have with prescribing physician, who acts as marriage broker, and brand attributes influence relationships with prescription pharmaceutical brands. Consumer's ethos and nature of illness also influence brand relationships. Research limitations/implications - The study provides insights into brand choice situations where consumers have low control and addresses impact of intermediaries on consumer experiences. It opens the way for further research on mediated brand relationships. Practical implications - Marketing managers need to understand the role of intermediaries, where applicable, in influencing consumer relationships with brands. Originality/value - The study closes a gap in academic research (which is sparse) on relationships with prescription pharmaceutical brands held by consumers - specifically older consumers. It also encourages a critical view of the arranged marriage metaphor as a means of understanding consumer-brand interactions. Griffith Business School, Department of MarketingNo Full Tex...|$|R
