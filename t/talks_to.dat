Immediate reactions to team monitoring and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room were investigated by means of lag sequential analysis.

The results highlight the relevance of team monitoring and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room for team coordination and performance in dynamic healthcare environments...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relation between child distress, parent distraction behaviors, and parent other nonprocedural talk during pediatric cancer procedures. Participants were 72 children with cancer (age 5 to 13 years old) and their mothers. Cancer procedures were videotaped and coded for parent behaviors and child distress. Contrary to hypotheses, child distress {{was positively related to}} parent verbal distraction and nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child and negatively related <b>to</b> nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult in the room. Sequential analyses suggested that verbal distraction and nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child were more likely to occur after crying, while nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult was less likely to occur after crying. Crying was less likely to occur after nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult. Results suggest that nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult functions differently than nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child; however, given the low frequency of behaviors, results should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
