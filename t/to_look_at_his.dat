5|$|Meanwhile, it is Casual Friday {{and most}} people dress too loosely at the office. Angela (Angela Kinsey) {{complains}} to Toby (Paul Lieberstein) about Oscar (Oscar Nunez) wearing sandals to work and having <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet. Meredith (Kate Flannery) disgusts {{the rest of the}} employees by wearing a very short dress without any panties or a bra, thus exposing herself {{to the rest of the}} office as she tries to adjust it to meet Toby's requests. Toby calls a meeting with everyone regarding Casual Friday. When Dwight tries to take charge of the meeting, Toby is finally stern with him and cancels Casual Friday, much to everyone's disappointment.|$|E
5|$|While {{under house}} arrest, Bhimsen smuggled {{a letter to}} the Resident Hodgson {{appealing}} him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment, but sought permission from his superiors to do so. Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped off her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a khukuri on 28 July 1839. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1939, at the age of 64. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals. On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshowr was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.|$|E
25|$|Mining in Rana {{has taken}} place since it was {{established}} at Ormlia in 1799. Ole Tobias Olsen discovered iron ore on his farm of Nord-Dunderland, for which he registered a mining claim in 1879. Since 1872, Olsen {{had been working on}} promoting the construction of the Nordland Line northwards from Trondheim. In 1891, he petitioned the government <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> claim as a source of national wealth and requested that the Nordland Line be built via the Dunderland Valley to allow shipment of the ore to the coastal port of Mo. He received a grant to carry out technical investigations for a railway.|$|E

25|$|Cao Cao {{had stayed}} in Wan for more than 10 days when Zhang Xiu {{suddenly}} rebelled and launched a surprise attack on Cao's camp. Cao Cao was caught unprepared so he retreated with a few horsemen. Dian Wei stood guard {{at the entrance to}} the camp and prevented Zhang Xiu's soldiers from advancing further. The enemy then scattered and broke into Cao Cao's camp from the other entrances. Dian Wei had about a dozen men with him and they were all heavily outnumbered by Zhang Xiu's forces. However, Dian Wei fought bravely with a long ji, and with each swing of his weapon, he broke more than ten enemy spears. As the battle went on, Dian Wei's men were eventually all killed and Dian himself had sustained several wounds all over his body, but he continued fighting the enemy at close quarters with short weapons. Dian Wei grabbed two enemies and killed them, and the others did not dare to approach him. Dian Wei then rushed forward and slew several more enemy soldiers before eventually succumbing to his wounds. Just before his death, he was still glaring and swearing at the enemy. Only after confirming that Dian Wei was dead did the enemies dare to come forward and decapitate him. Dian Wei's head was passed around for Zhang Xiu's men to see. They also came <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> headless body.|$|E
500|$|Virginia {{died the}} {{following}} day, January 30, {{after five years}} of illness. Shew helped in organizing her funeral, even purchasing the coffin. Death notices appeared in several newspapers. On February 1, The New York Daily Tribune and the Herald carried the simple obituary: [...] "On Saturday, the 30th ult., of pulmonary consumption, in the 25th year of her age, VIRGINIA ELIZA, wife of EDGAR A. POE." [...] The funeral was February 2, 1847. Attendees included Nathaniel Parker Willis, Ann S. Stephens, and publisher George Pope Morris. Poe refused <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> dead wife's face, saying he preferred to remember her living. Though now buried at Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, Virginia was originally buried in a vault owned by the Valentine family, from whom the Poes rented their Fordham cottage.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{could not}} bring himself <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> mother's corpse when {{he was taken to}} the Sefton General Hospital, and was so distraught that he put his head on Mimi's lap {{throughout}} the funeral service. Lennon refused to talk to Walley for months afterwards, and Walley felt that Lennon somehow held him responsible. Julia was buried in Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. Her gravesite was for some time unmarked, but it was later identified as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805". The graveyard's location is approx. 1.19miles east of 1Blomfield Road. Baird said that the Stanley family hoped to finally put a headstone on her mother's grave, which she hoped [...] "will be a private affair for the family and not for the public". A headstone was subsequently placed on Julia's grave (replacing a wooden cross), with the words [...] "Mummy, John, Victoria, Julia, Jackie" [...] inscribed.|$|E

500|$|In {{the season}} {{following}} {{his return to}} Australia, Ponsford continued to make large scores. He started the season by hitting 214runs (out of a Victoria team total of 315) against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval and followed this with 151 at the MCG against Queensland. In his next match, against New South Wales, Ponsford again rewrote the record books. Ponsford scored 352runs, 334 {{of them in a}} single day, and helped Victoria to an innings total of 1,107, which remains the highest team total in first-class cricket, breaking Victoria's own record set four years earlier. After Ponsford played the ball back on to his stumps to be dismissed bowled, he then turned <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> broken wicket and famously said, [...] "Cripes, I am unlucky." [...] For the season, Ponsford went on to score 1,229runs at an average of 122.90, including six centuries and two half-centuries from only ten innings.|$|E
500|$|The {{family had}} been briefly {{separated}} in April 1918 when the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and Maria to Yekaterinburg. Alexei and the three other young women remained behind because Alexei had suffered another attack of hemophilia. The Empress chose Maria to accompany her because [...] "Olga's spirits were too low" [...] and level-headed Tatiana was needed {{to take care of}} Alexei. In May 1918 the remaining children and servants boarded the ship Rus that ferried them from Tobolsk to Yekaterinburg. Aboard ship, Olga was distressed when she saw one of the guards slip from a ladder and injure his foot. She ran to the man and explained that she had been a nurse during the war and wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> foot. He refused her offer of treatment. All through the afternoon, Olga fretted over the guard, whom she called [...] "her poor fellow." [...] At Tobolsk Olga and her sisters had sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from the Bolsheviks, since Alexandra had written to warn them that upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, she, Nicholas and Maria had been aggressively searched and belongings confiscated.|$|E
500|$|Show creator Seth MacFarlane {{claims on}} the DVD {{commentary}} track that, unlike most Family Guy episodes, this episode has no cultural references or references to real-world events except for Chris calling Meg [...] "David Koresh" [...] {{when they play}} with fireworks and the cutaway of Peter, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland spending last Saturday with the Lord of Darkness from Legend. There was also a discussion that the gang had about the show Wings while swimming in the beer tank. Quagmire admits {{that he is the}} most knowledgeable about the show because he is a pilot and the show focuses on two pilots. When Peter goes <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> secret stash of pornography, the intro from Get Smart is referenced. Stewie asks Brian if Jillian has an alibi, and Brian says no. [...] Stewie starts singing the song [...] "U.G.L.Y.", understanding that Jillian does not have an alibi. Brian sets up a cutaway when he says that breaking up with Jillian will be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin. The ensuing gag shows the actors looking for mention of their play following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
