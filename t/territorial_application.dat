We review the main characteristics of a multi-agents system, namely interactions and cooperations of agents, communications and behaviours between them and finally the schedule of actions and jobs assignment to agents. The multi-agents system approach is increasingly applied in social and economic sciences; so we study mainly the <b>territorial</b> <b>applications.</b> In these applications new characteristics arise from the consideration of territory (land and space where the agents live or territory as an agent in itself, that evolves in the time). We study possible new applications of multi-agents applied to the territory (for instance, to define town planning policies or to locate dangerous facilities). Furthermore we study new tools to make operational multi-agents systems (mainly Swarm, the toolkit of Santa Fe Institute). With Swarm we present two kind of territorial applications: with located agents (fixed in space) and with not located agents (moving in the space). Finally we show {{the results of these}} applications. ...|$|R

Two different methods to extract absolute or relative elevation from SAR data are interferometry and radargrammetry, both using a couple of images of the same area acquired from two different points of view.

It is well known that the two main steps for DSMs generation from SAR imagery according to the radargrammetric approach are the stereo pair orientation and the image matching for the detection of homologous points. In this paper the topics related to image orientation of SAR stereo pairs through an orientation model based on geometric reconstruction are investigated. The new model, implemented in the scientific software SISAR (Software per Immagini Satellitari ad Alta Risoluzione) has been tested on two SAR stereo pair acquired in Spotlight mode on the test site of Mausanne (Southern France) and on Merano (Northern Italy).

40|$|Digital Surface and Terrain Models (DSM/DTM) {{have large}} {{relevance}} in some <b>territorial</b> <b>applications,</b> such as topographic mapping, monitoring engineering, geology, security, land {{planning and management}} of Earth's resources. This work {{is focused on the}} generation of DSM/DTM from high resolution SAR data using the radargrammetric approach. At present, it is pretty well known that the radar interferometry may suffer for lack of coherence, especially over areas with vegetation/forest. In this sense, radargrammetry could be a possible alternative solution to avoid the classical decorrelation problem affecting the interferometric technique, using just a couple of images with appropriate geometric configuration. On the other hand, the achievable accuracy level of a DSM is strictly related both to the image orientation and to the matching process. In this moment, the importance of the radargrammetric approach is rapidly growing due to the new high resolution imagery (up to 1 m of ground resolution) which can be acquired by COSMO-SkyMed (Italy), TerraSAR-X (Germany) and RADARSAT- 2 (Canada) sensors in SpotLight mode, and also others research groups are strongly interested in this topic. The research group of Geodesy and Geomatic Institute of the University of Rome “La Sapienza”, developed a tool embedded within the already implemented scientific software SISAR in order to exploit new SAR sensors imagery according to the radargrammetric approach. Here, the results obtained with two COSMO-SkyMed Spotlight same-side stereopairs on the Como area (Northern Italy), acquired on ascending and descending orbits, will be presented and discussed. The accuracy assessment of the generated radargrammetric DSMs has been performed using DEMANAL software, developed by Prof. K.

40|$|The {{different}} "rounds" of Multilateral Trade Negotiations have achieved, {{years after}} years, to reduce and remove traditional trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas, {{as well as}} non-tariff barriers. As tariffs came down and quotas increased or totally disappeared, traders who {{wanted to use the}} new trade opportunities ran into the trade impeding effects of domestic rules and procedures that, even if do not formally discriminate between imported and domestically produced goods, may still create trade barriers. Recently, trade negotiators have therefore come to see differences between the national laws of trading partners as possible sources of non-tariff barriers, and started to focus on competition laws in particular. An harmonization of competition rules would avoid barriers resulting from divergences between these rules and would avoid their extra <b>territorial</b> <b>applications.</b> At the same time this idea emerged in the International community's mind, two of the main trade and economic partners decided to use the bilateral way to start a real cooperation on the competition field. The European Community and the United States of America entered into an Agreement in 1991, completed by second one in 1998. These two agreements have been applied for a few years now and have been effective in many ways, but have also shown their limits. Therefore, the focus is now standing on multilateral solutions and partners have started to consider the idea of "internationalizing" competition laws and policies but, to achieve that goal, many problems will have to be resolved first, such as deciding which international organisation {{is going to be in}} charge of competition matters and what set of rules is going to be applied by this organisation. This Thesis analyses this process and tries to bring a few answers to those difficult and delicate questions involving not only legal, but economical, political and diplomatic issues...|$|R

However, it does not address the question of the perception of Europe through pre-existing historical cultural institutions (heritage industry), permanently anchored to a regional territory, such as theaters, operas houses, orchestras, conservatories, museums, universities, etc. How do these immersive institutions impact the territorial cohesion, and mobilities in Europe ? How do these institutions react to the restructuring of the competitive field? Are they managing adaptive or hybrid strategies with new conceptions of culture?

This thesis analyses the techniques adopted by the EU to establish the <b>territorial</b> scope of <b>application</b> of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR), {{and the impact of}} these techniques both to the status of the EU and to the notion of territorial jurisdiction. This work will first look into the expansive <b>territorial</b> scope of <b>application</b> of the GDPR, set out in the Article 3 of the regulation, and explore the changes the GDPR brings about in relation to the earlier data protection legislation in the EU. The work proceeds by looking behind the forces driving the change, specifically the challenges the Internet has caused to the protection of privacy and data protection as EU fundamental rights. It observes the other functions the territorially atypical legislative technique serves, mainly the Statecraft functions of the comprehensive EU data protection framework, and the approaches the EU interpretative bodies have adopted to widen the scope of application of prior EU data protection legislation, to establish power through the concept of the Digital Single Market. The work finally presents the concept of ultraterritorial jurisdiction through which the legislative development of the EU data protection framework can be better understood. Where previous legislation such as the Data Protection Directive and prior national legislation of Member States has typically included some active, physical element within the territory of the relevant state, the GDPR does not do so.

40|$|Digital Surface and Terrain Models (DSMs/DTMs) {{have large}} {{relevance}} in some <b>territorial</b> <b>applications,</b> such as topographic mapping, {{spatial and temporal}} change detection, feature extraction and data visualization. DSMs/DTMs extraction from satellite stereo pair offers some advantages, among which low cost, speed of data acquisition and processing, surveys of critical areas, easy monitoring of wide areas, availability of several commercial software and algorithms for data processing. In particular, the DSMs generation from SAR data offers the significant advantage of possible data acquisition during the night and in presence of clouds. The availability of new high resolution SAR spaceborne sensors offers new interesting potentialities for the acquisition of data useful for the generation of DSMs. Two different approaches {{may be used to}} generate DSMs from SAR data: the interferometric and the radargrammetric one, both using a couple of images of the same area acquired from two different points of view. The aim of this work is the development and the implementation of a rigorous radargrammetric model for the orientation of SAR imagery, suited to the Digital Surface Model generation. The model performs a 3 D orientation based on two range and two zero-Doppler equations; the results presented are related to the orientation of SAR stereo pairs in slant range and zero-Doppler projection, acquired in SpotLight mode (1 m ground resolution). The model has been implemented in SISAR (Software per Immagini Satellitari ad Alta Risoluzione), a scientific software developed at Geodesy and Geomatic Institute of the University of Rome La Sapienza. This software was at first devoted to the orientation of high resolution optical imagery, and in the last year it has been extended also to SAR imagery. Moreover a tool for the SAR Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) generation has been implemented in SISAR software, similarly to the one already developed for the optical sensors. The possibility to generate RPCs starting from a rigorous model sounds of particular interest since, at present, the most part of SAR imagery is not supplied with RPCs, although the Rational Polynomial Functions (RPFs) model is available in several commercial software. The RPCs can be an useful tool in place of the rigorous model in processes as the image orthorectification/geocoding or as the DSMs generation, since the RPFs model is very simple and fast to be applied. The model implemented has been tested on COSMO-SkyMed and on TerraSAR-X images; both satellites are able to acquire imagery in SpotLight mode. The accuracy evaluation shows that the mean vertical accuracy is at 3. 0 - 3. 5 m; this preliminary results are satisfying, considering the mean accuracy of the available GPs. An investigation using more accurate GPs, for example GPS points, is recommended, although it has to be underlined that also the uncertainty of the GPs collimation on the images (1 - 3 pixels) could affect the results. As regards the model performance varying the independent sets of GCPs, the software shows a stable behavior and the increase of GCPs number does not improve the results remarkably. The commercial software OrthoEngine provides basically the same level of accuracy of SISAR, whereas {{a significant difference between the}} two software is that OrthoEngine needs 8 GCPs at least for the orientation of SAR images, whereas SISAR gets good results also using few points (3 or 5 GCPs). The application of RPCs model to SAR stereo pairs gives good results, absolutely comparable with those derived through the radargrammetric rigorous model, what proves the effectiveness of the RPCs generation tool implemented in SISAR...|$|R

The importance, as well as the various forms such issues take, has recently been highlighted in the decision of the Singapore High Court (SGHC) in Laos v. Sanum. In this case, the SGHC was asked by Laos to set aside an earlier arbitral award (in Sanum v. Laos), filed by a Macanese legal entity and rendered under the China-Laos bilateral investment treaty (BIT). In approaching the matter, the SGHC set aside the award {{on the grounds that the}} China-Laos BIT did not extend to Macao. This decision has provoked mixed feelings, as it may weigh heavily against the <b>territorial</b> <b>application</b> of Chinese IIAs to Hong Kong and Macao.

In any decisional process, decision taking is based on a decision analysis phase which relies on a documentation/information phase. It is then followed by the implementation and the evaluation phases. The foundation of the documentation/information step is composed by three interconnected aspects: data, issue and context. Decision being the act of making up one’s mind can be linked to space or influenced by space or not at all related to space.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of European Community (EC) 1 Competition Law by the competent Communitarian institutions, namely the Commission, the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice. Because the discussion will concern its application to non-European legal entities, one explanatory remark is necessary. Dealing with the application of Competition Law with regard to non-European corporations {{is not meant to}} suggest that any form of discrimination based on nationality exists. As former Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan commented with regard to one of the early cases involving non-EC companies, “the location of a party’s incorporation or headquarters is immaterial for Competition Law”, 2 which must focus on impact on markets. One necessary goal of this thesis then will be the assessment of the EC’s treatment of these cases. A legal entity’s non-European nationality must not be confused with the lack of links to the EC, as the presence of an established (not necessarily incorporated) branch or subsidiary within the EC will suffice to determine the ordinary - that is <b>territorial</b> - <b>application</b> of EC law. Instead, the focus will be on cases that would require extraterritorial application of the law: As it will be discussed, the Court of Justice has never formally endorsed the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, 3 so that {{it will be necessary to}} discover how the EC deals with cases that have no links that could trigger the territoriality principle. Another purpose of this thesis will be to search into the ramifications of the transnational structure of certain corporations. In fact, while these may be affected by the peculiarities of EC Competition Law, they may be able to affect a market in Europe through their dominance of another market elsewhere. Based on the assumption that the legal standards cannot and will not vary simply depending on the nationality of the entities that are subject to the EC’s sovereignty, a case-oriented analysis will be made to uncover the general orientations, if any, followed by the Communitarian institutions in the application of Competition Law to non-EC firms. However, while Mr. Brittan’s argument can be said to hold true, it must also be noted that EC law is no exception to one basic principle, that is the territorial nature of the law. The law is the expression of one sovereign power which has territorially limited extension and its application to entities or situations that have no territorial links to its territory deserves special treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of territoriality is a truism in intellectual property (IP) law. A premise underlying the principle is the right of each state {{to determine the extent}} to which IP rights exist and are protected within its own territory to fulfil its own economic, social and cultural policy goals. This is done by giving a right to prevent others from doing within the protected territory any of the acts that are exclusively reserved to the right holder under the IP statute that granted or protects the IP right. The {{principle of}} territoriality informs that IP rights granted or protected by a state are independent from those granted or protected by other states, and that the rights conferred under each state’s IP law are limited to the territory of that state. As the {{principle of territoriality}} neatly allocated jurisdiction among states on a territorial basis, it purportedly obviated the need for private international law. Each state exercised jurisdiction over the infringement of its own rights and applied its own domestic IP law, which served the interests of the states and of the parties. With the increase in the protection and exploitation of IP rights across national borders, infringements do not remain within hermetically sealed national territories. Acts taken in one state can have effects in other states and impair the policies that the rights were designed to fulfil. This raises questions concerning the <b>territorial</b> scope of <b>application</b> of the domestic IP law, that is, whether it is interpreted with respect to a domestic tangible act, effects on a domestic policy goal or both. In addition, the transborder exploitation of IP rights raises questions of private international law with respect to whether states exercise jurisdiction and apply national law to disputes concerning infringements of their domestic rights or whether states exercise jurisdiction and apply national law to disputes arising from acts committed in their territories (or both). These determinations may depend on different factors such as the different interests taken into consideration (e. g. state or party interests), the different legal traditions upon which the legal systems are based and the characteristics and functions of the IP rights themselves. This dissertation compares the interpretation and operation of the principle of territoriality of IP law in the private law resolution of transborder IP infringement disputes in the legal systems of the European Union and the United States, two distinctly different legal systems that have significant trade and investment relations with each other. The comparison shows that while the systems are functionally similar, the principle of territoriality is interpreted and operates somewhat differently in the two legal systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is the study of the ruins of many rural churches using some technologies, like 3 D reliefs and a Geographic Information System (GIS). The churches are distributed throughout the lower valley of the Cedrino river, a hilly zone located in the central east coast of the island of Sardinia. The territory considers Loculi, Irgoli, Onifai, Galtellì, and Orosei municipalities. Most of these churches have been built during the medieval period, which makes it possible to estimate the human medieval settlement and to make a complete documentation of each church. Until today none of circa 20 sites has ever been investigated from an archaeological study. The research has provided a multi-scale study: from artefacts to landscape. The detailed scale has consisted in reading the masonry structures preserved and making an analytic documentation of buildings using 3 D reliefs, where possible; the regional scale has been studied by storing data in a GIS and using those data for <b>territorial</b> analyses. The <b>application</b> of the three-dimensionality in the study of historical buildings is still relatively new. In order to resolve critical issues related to the methodology required in the archaeological-architectonic studies, further investigations are still necessary. In recent years, the development of 3 D models in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage showed a growing trend, but in several cases during the data collection, as well as the historical analysis, archaeological knowledge is lacking. The information obtained from 3 D models is limited to visualizations and virtual reconstruction. In this research, both the interior and the exterior of a selected sacred building have been surveyed by an integrated approach using a terrestrial laser scanner and photogrammetry. The use of multiple techniques was an essential requirement to produce complete 3 D models of monuments, but also it was the best compromise among geometric resolution, costs, and time. Other monument have been documented by a photogrammetric approach called Structure from Motion. These models have been used to develop and verify the interpretations and archaeological analyses through the possibility to carry out geometric measurements, correlate surfaces with volumes, visualize the relation between inner and external walls. Finally, we have elaborated technical drawings for very high-precision documentation. All of the archaeological data collected during the surveys have been stored in the GIS to create an archive that can be connected to existing databases and implemented with data from different sources, such as information from surveys in remote-sensing landscapes archaeology and computerization of data from previous studies. The knowledge acquired will be the basis for the realization of preserving proposals and the enhancement of the cultural resource of “rural churches” involving and making local communities aware in its own history...|$|R
