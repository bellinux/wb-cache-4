5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century several {{attempts}} were made <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> monument honoring Jennings's public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> marker for Jennings's grave, but each attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Pat Nixon Park was {{established}} in Cerritos, California. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property. The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> statue of the former first lady, {{one of the few}} statues created in the image of a first lady.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Government of Tasmania {{allocated}} $2million <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> roof above 6,000terrace seats, in {{readiness for}} the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup; {{this meant that}} almost all of the seating area was protected from the weather. In 2004, the ground became known as Aurora Stadium as the result of six-year naming rights sponsorship deal with Aurora Energy.|$|E

5|$|The archaeological {{excavation}} into Borobudur during reconstruction {{suggests that}} adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith {{had already begun}} <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> large structure on Borobudur's hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are unlike any Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|Third class {{funerals}} were {{reserved for}} pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense {{in the section}} of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} in the governor's mansion in Frankfort on February 21, 1834. He {{was the second}} sitting governor of Kentucky to die in office. Originally buried in the Breathitt family cemetery, he was later re-interred at Maple Grove Cemetery in Russellville. Breathitt County, Kentucky was formed in 1839 and named in his honor. On March 5, 1872, the Kentucky General Assembly resolved <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> monument over Breathitt's grave in Russellville.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{continued}} to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, {{he died on}} 8 January 1642, aged 77. The Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando II, wished to bury him in {{the main body of}} the Basilica of Santa Croce, next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, and <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> marble mausoleum in his honour.|$|E
5|$|In March 1898, a {{resolution}} {{was introduced in}} Congress for a commission <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> monument to Lafayette in Paris {{on behalf of the}} United States. The bill passed the Senate, and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 the Benedictines being a Roman Catholic [...] started <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>an</b> own {{residence}} in Jaruco. The project failed in 2010 {{because of lack}} of water so that the Benedictines remained in their provisorial house in Havana (2011).|$|R
50|$|Musides {{proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>an</b> elaborate marble tomb for his friend, while Kalos asked {{only for}} the planting of olive twigs near his head. After the death of Kalos, Musides buried the olive twigs, in addition to constructing a tomb.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipal}} {{collection of}} modern and contemporary {{art of the}} city of Strasbourg has been constantly enlarged and enriched since 1871 and the founding of the Reichsland Alsace-Lorraine. There had already been plans <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>an</b> independent museum since the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Gaveston's death, however, civil conflict in England rarely seemed far away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a safe distance away from Edward's forces in the south. He also probably hoped <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth and authority, and challenging that of the King. He may perhaps also have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.|$|E
5|$|On June 3, 2009, Nancy Reagan {{unveiled}} {{a statue of}} her late husband in the United States Capitol rotunda. The statue represents the state of California in the National Statuary Hall Collection. After Reagan's death, both major American political parties agreed <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> statue of Reagan {{in the place of}} that of Thomas Starr King. The day before, President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act into law, establishing a commission to plan activities to mark the upcoming centenary of Reagan's birth.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos {{were forced}} {{to spend the night}} {{freezing}} in the open in a ditch. The following day, after sappers from the Royal Engineers managed <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> temporary bridge across the canal, a number of Churchill and Sherman tanks from the 8th Hussars managed to get across and No. 1 and No. 6 Troops climbed on top and advanced across the open ground and into the centre of the town.|$|E

50|$|The {{return of}} the Two Sicilies to Spain was {{confirmed}} by the Treaty of Vienna in 1738, which ended the war. Charles named Montemar Duke of Bitonto and commissioned Giovanni Antonio Medrano <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>an</b> obelisk on the battlefield to commemorate the battle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{considerable}} number of works were painted immediately after the 1948 fighting.

5|$|A {{campaign}} <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> {{statue of}} Seacole in London was launched on 24 November 2003, chaired by Clive Soley, Baron Soley. The {{design of the}} sculpture, which is planned to be erected in the grounds of St Thomas' Hospital, was announced on 18 June 2009. There was significant opposition to the siting of the statue, but it was unveiled on 30 June 2016. A feature film is being made of her life by Seacole Pictures. A short animation about Mary Seacole was adapted from a book entitled Mother Seacole, published in 2005 {{as part of the}} bicentenary celebrations. Seacole is featured in BBC's Horrible Histories, where she is portrayed by Dominique Moore.|$|E
5|$|As Vizier he {{had taken}} all powers under his control as the king was only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E
5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's right <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> cross at the Ohio Statehouse {{after the}} state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He {{argued that the}} {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross {{was different from the}} Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice Department.|$|E

50|$|Feldman {{also argued}} pro bono in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals against {{the efforts of}} a Jewish group in Tenafly, New Jersey, the Tenafly Eruv Association, <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>an</b> eruv.

5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the federal government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|Following several {{donations}} by {{the people}} of Cooma and the Monaro District, a Memorial Plaque to Corey was erected in Centennial Park, Cooma in 1979. In 1995, the plaque was moved to the Cooma Memorial and the committee involved with the relocation decided <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> diorama based on a painting in the Australian War Memorial depicting stretcher bearers bringing in wounded soldiers under heavy shell fire at Mont St Quentin during the First World War. A local artist and sculptor, Chris Graham, was commissioned to undertake the project which was constructed from steel and concrete. It was erected in the Cooma War Memorial area on 23 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts had been made to tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> <b>a</b> high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
