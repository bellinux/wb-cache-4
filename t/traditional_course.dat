The <b>traditional</b> <b>course</b> layout, designed by famed course architect Harry Colt, proved very popular with touring pros. Florence Harvey, (1878–1968), Hamilton golfer, was the Ontario Ladies Amateur Champion 1904, 1906, 1913, and 1914 and the Canadian Ladies Champion in 1903 and 1904.

2500|$|In Mecca, where Maulana Azad was born, but {{returned}} to Calcutta {{with his family}} in 1890. Azad began to master several languages, including [...] Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Bengali, Arabic, and English. He was also trained in the Mazahibs of Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali fiqh, Shariat, mathematics, philosophy, world history and science by reputed tutors hired by his family. An avid and determined student, the precocious Azad was running a library, a reading room, a debating society before he was twelve, wanted to write on the life of Ghazali at twelve, was contributing learned articles to Makhzan (A literary magazine) at fourteen, was teaching a class of students, most of whom were twice his age, when he was merely fifteen and succeeded in completing the <b>traditional</b> <b>course</b> of study at the young age of sixteen, nine years ahead of his contemporaries, and brought out a magazine at the same age. In fact, in the field of journalism, he was publishing a poetical journal (Nairang-e-Aalam) and was already an editor of a weekly (Al-Misbah), in 1900, at the age of twelve and, in 1903, brought out a monthly journal, Lissan-us-Sidq, which soon gained popularity. At the age of thirteen, he was married to a young Muslim girl, Zulaikha Begum. Azad compiled many treatises interpreting the Qur'an, the Hadis, and the principles of Fiqh and Kalam.|$|E
2500|$|To begin with, Latin and Greek were in trouble: ancient {{languages}} did {{not seem}} to have much application to the busy commercial life of the new nation. Accordingly, French was gradually being introduced into the college curriculum, sometimes as a substitute for Greek or Hebrew. It is significant in this context that French was chosen for the Union College motto. By the second decade of the 19th century, calls for reform in higher education, especially in the traditional liberal arts colleges, were becoming increasingly demanding; a response was required if many of these institutions were to survive at all. The classical curriculum somehow needed to accommodate the needs of a practical, utilitarian, and egalitarian nation as it confronted its manifest destiny to conquer not only geography but nature itself. One solution to this problem was the so-called [...] "parallel course of study" [...] in scientific and [...] "literary" [...] subjects. [...] The basic idea was to offer a scientific curriculum in parallel to the classical curriculum, for those students wishing a more modern treatment of modern languages, mathematics, and science, equal in dignity to the <b>traditional</b> <b>course</b> of study. [...] An early attempt to establish such a parallel scientific course was made by Hobart College in Geneva, New York, when it was founded in 1825, so that at least some students could get on with the [...] "practical business of life…without passing through a tedious course of classical studies." [...] But this experiment at Hobart soon languished, partly for lack of support by President Jasper Adams and partly for lack of funds. [...] A similar experiment launched by Union College in 1828 was to fare much better.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Enrollment {{in online}} courses has outpaced overall {{university}} enrollment {{for the past}} several years. The growth of online courses {{does not appear to be}} slowing. The purpose of this study was to compare course completion and student academic performance between online and <b>traditional</b> <b>courses.</b> Archival data from the host university student records system was collected using the Structured Query Language. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze student characteristics. Chi-square analysis was used to determine if statistically significant differences existed between students enrolled in online and <b>traditional</b> <b>courses</b> when comparing course completion and academic performance. Analysis found statistically significant differences existed in both course completion and academic performance for students enrolled in online versus <b>traditional</b> <b>courses.</b> Additional analysis indicated statistically significant differences existed in course completion by course discipline...|$|R

In recent years, community colleges have added an array of online courses {{with the expectation that}} they would expand access to students who are limited by time, transportation, work, and/or family constraints. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the success of online courses in comparison with <b>traditional</b> <b>courses</b> by analyzing the transcripts of students who have enrolled in both <b>traditional</b> and online <b>courses.</b> Specifically, in this study, student transcripts were analyzed from the Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC). Data was collected from the academic years of 2005 to 2009 and disaggregated by demographic and academic information. Findings indicate that significant differences in grade point average (GPA) and course completion ratio (CCR) exist between students' performance in <b>traditional</b> and online <b>courses.</b> Specifically, students on average attain higher GPAs and CCRs in <b>traditional</b> <b>courses</b> when compared to their <b>traditional</b> <b>courses.</b> Furthermore, students' demographic categories and course taking behaviors were positively correlated with higher rates of success in online courses...|$|R
