5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

25|$|Cannabis, {{also known}} as {{marijuana}} among other names, is a psychoactive drug from the Cannabis plant intended for medical or recreational use. The main psychoactive part of cannabis is <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC); one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids.

[...] Norton reiterated this point in an Initiative 71 questions and answers section on her House Web site.|$|R
25|$|Toxicology {{analysis}} of the balloon pilot found evidence of <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), indicating cannabis use. The report was the second fatal aviation incident report released by the TAIC in two days in which crew members tested positive for cannabis, following on from {{the release of the}} final report into the 2010 New Zealand Fletcher FU24 crash, in which two of the skydiving instructors killed in the crash tested positive for cannabis.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 26 {{varieties}} of hemp with {{low levels of}} <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC) are certified by the European Union (EU). They have, unlike other types, a very high fiber content of 30-40%. In contrast to cannabis for medical use, varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.2% THC and they are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana. The most important cannabinoid in industrial hemp is cannabidiol (CBD) with a proportion of 1 to 5%.|$|E
25|$|Although {{cannabis}} as a {{drug and}} industrial hemp both derive from the species Cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), they are distinct strains with unique phytochemical compositions and uses. Hemp has lower concentrations of THC and higher concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects. The legality of industrial hemp varies widely between countries. Some governments regulate the concentration of THC and permit only hemp that is bred with an especially low THC content.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{available}} legal {{regulations in}} Poland do not define the concentration thresholds enabling {{to differentiate between}} the states of “after-use” versus “under the influence” of a drug, {{as it is in}} the case of alcohol. The aim of the study was to analyse jurisdiction in cases regarding the evaluation of the effects of intoxicating agents and ethanol-like intoxicants and to identify ambiguities and gaps in the applicable regulations leading to problems in preparing expert opinions. Material and methods: The material included the opinions of experts in the field of toxicology and forensic medicine made by the Department of Forensic Medicine in Lublin in the years 2009 – 2011 and records obtained in the process of inquiry from the regional prosecutor’s offices and courts in 52 cases. Results : Amongst 52 cases in which the ordered toxicology examinations demonstrated the presence of intoxicating agents in drivers’ blood (<b>tetrahydrocannabinols</b> in 39 and amphetamine in 21 cases) in 2 cases petty offence proceedings were instituted (Art. 87 of the Petty Offence Code) although high concentrations of xenobiotics indicated the state of being “under the influence” of a narcotic drug (Art. 178 a of the Penal Code). Three cases were discontinued despite expert opinions that the drivers were at least in the after-narcotic use state. In only 3 cases were witnesses asked to provide testimony about the circumstances of the driver’s conduct. Conclusions : The analysis has demonstrated that judicial bodies expect forensic expertise based exclusively on toxicological examination results; when expert findings are inconclusive, they only administer litigations opportunistically applying the principle of the presumption of innocence understood literally. Considering the above, threshold values of “use” and “influence” of the most commonly detected drugs should be urgently determined...|$|R
25|$|Law {{and order}} was another key issue, with Labor {{promising}} extra police. Tough drink and drug driving laws {{had also been}} introduced which included zero tolerance roadside testing for <b>Tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC) and Methamphetamine, and later MDMA. Labor introduced speed limit reduction legislation which took effect in March 2003 which saw non-arterial non-main roads and most Adelaide CBD roads reduce from 60km/h to 50km/h. The Liberals proposed {{to increase the speed}} limit back to 60km/h for several roads, concentrated mainly around the Adelaide Park Lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{cannabis}} {{are caused by}} the chemical compounds in the plant, including cannabinoids, such as <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), which {{is only one of}} more than 100 different cannabinoids present in the plant. Cannabis cofactor compounds have also been linked to lowering body temperature, modulating immune functioning, and cell protection. The essential oil of cannabis contains many fragrant terpenoids which may synergize with the cannabinoids to produce their unique effects. THC is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also pharmacologically active, so the drug effect outlasts measurable THC levels in blood.|$|E
25|$|According to some studies, {{the more}} often {{cannabis}} is used {{the more likely}} a person {{is to develop a}} psychotic illness, with frequent use being correlated with twice the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia. While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizophrenia by some, it remains controversial, with pre-existing vulnerability to psychosis emerging as the key factor that influences the link between cannabis use and psychosis. Some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis, <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have opposite effects with respect to psychosis. While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals, CBD may reduce the symptoms caused by cannabis.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may also}} be treated for {{substance}} abuse following the administration of psychoactive substances containing amphetamine, caffeine, <b>tetrahydrocannabinol,</b> cocaine, phencyclidines, or other inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants. Clinicians assessing and treating substance abusers must establish therapeutic rapport to counter denial and other negative attitudes directed towards treatment. In addition, the clinician must determine substances used, the route of administration, dosage, and time of last use to determine the necessary {{short and long term}} treatments. An appropriate choice of treatment setting must also be determined. These settings may include outpatient facilities, partial hospitals, residential treatment centers, or hospitals. Both the immediate and long term treatment and setting is determined by the severity of dependency and seriousness of physiological complications arising from the abuse.|$|E
25|$|When {{analysing}} the Dutch model, both disadvantages and advantages can {{be drawn}} when comparing the results with other countries. On a moral argument, tolerating soft drugs {{can be seen as}} the defeat of the government against hedonism. Additionally, decades of growing and perfecting cannabis and hashish has resulted in increased levels of the main active hallucinogenic constituent <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), as levels have doubled, making the derived products more powerful, and therefore requiring less to achieve the desired effect. The coffee shop will lose its license if it caught selling to minors. Though there was a slight increase of use at the beginning, the rates balanced out some years later. The presence of coffee shops does not translate in public urge for experimentation. In fact, most people that did not consume drugs before the enhancement of the policy continue not to use them.|$|E
25|$|An {{inquiry into}} the {{accident}} by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) concluded that the balloon pilot made an error of judgement when contact with the power lines became imminent, trying to out-climb the power lines rather than using the rapid descent system to drop the balloon quickly to the ground below. Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot after the accident tested positive for <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), suggesting {{he may have been}} under the influence of cannabis {{at the time of the}} crash, which ultimately led to the error of judgement. The crash was the sixth accident in ten years the TAIC had investigated (the TAIC also investigates marine and rail accidents) which involved key people testing positive for drugs or alcohol, and the commission has called for the Government to enact stricter measures in regards to drug and alcohol use in the aviation, marine and rail industries.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the main}} psychoactive {{constituent}} of Cannabis is <b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), {{the plant is}} known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these [...] "minor" [...] cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts. Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system.

2500|$|Reduced salivary {{flow rate}} is {{associated}} with increased caries since the buffering capability of saliva is not present to counterbalance the acidic environment created by certain foods. As a result, medical conditions that {{reduce the amount of}} saliva produced by salivary glands, in particular the submandibular gland and parotid gland, are likely to lead to dry mouth and thus to widespread tooth decay. Examples include Sjögren's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and sarcoidosis. Medications, such as antihistamines and antidepressants, can also impair salivary flow. Stimulants, most notoriously methylamphetamine, also occlude the flow of saliva to an extreme degree. This is known as meth mouth. <b>Tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), the active chemical substance in cannabis, also causes a nearly complete occlusion of salivation, known in colloquial terms as [...] "cotton mouth". Moreover, 63% of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States list dry mouth as a known side-effect. Radiation therapy {{of the head and neck}} may also damage the cells in salivary glands, somewhat increasing the likelihood of caries formation.|$|E
2500|$|Millennia of {{selective}} breeding {{have resulted in}} varieties that look quite different.
