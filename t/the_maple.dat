5|$|Anderson {{spent two}} seasons {{and part of}} another with <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs.

50|$|<b>The</b> sugar <b>maple</b> is {{also often}} {{confused}} with <b>the</b> Norway <b>maple,</b> {{though they are}} not closely related within the genus. <b>The</b> sugar <b>maple</b> is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf petiole (<b>the</b> Norway <b>maple</b> has white sap), brown, sharp-tipped buds (<b>the</b> Norway <b>maple</b> has blunt, green or reddish-purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (<b>the</b> Norway <b>maple</b> bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of <b>the</b> sugar <b>maple</b> have a more triangular shape, {{in contrast to the}} squarish lobes of <b>the</b> Norway <b>maple.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs named Armstrong the team's {{captain in}} 1957–58 as he succeeded Ted Kennedy and Jim Thomson {{who served as}} co-captains the season before. He {{finished}} fourth in team scoring with 42 points, then played his third All-Star Game during the 1958–59 season. He recorded four assists in the playoffs as <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs reached the 1959 Stanley Cup Final, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens. With 51 points in 1959–60, Armstrong finished one behind Bob Pulford for the team lead. Toronto again reached the Stanley Cup Final where they were again eliminated by Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the company}} {{has proven to be}} very profitable, they have had much less success at {{producing}} winning teams. Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their 1967 Stanley Cup.|$|E
50|$|In {{some parts}} of New England, {{particularly}} near urbanized areas, <b>the</b> sugar <b>maple</b> is being displaced by <b>the</b> Norway <b>maple.</b> <b>The</b> Norway <b>maple</b> is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in <b>the</b> sugar <b>maple's</b> replacement in those area. In addition, Norway maple produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> silver <b>maple</b> {{is closely}} related to <b>the</b> red <b>maple</b> (Acer rubrum), and can hybridise with it. The hybrid {{variation}} is known as <b>the</b> Freeman <b>maple</b> (Acer x freemanii). <b>The</b> Freeman <b>maple</b> is a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, combining the fast growth of silver <b>maple</b> with <b>the</b> less brittle wood, less invasive roots, and the beautiful bright red fall foliage of <b>the</b> red <b>maple.</b>|$|R

5|$|Armstrong {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire as a player following the championship but {{changed his mind and}} returned for another season. <b>The</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs placed him on their protected list for the 1967 Expansion Draft, and he remained with Toronto. He played in his seventh All-Star Game in 1968 and finished the season with 34 points. Retiring following the season before changing his mind became an annual event for Armstrong as he {{announced his}} intention to leave the game in five straight years. He remained a consistent scorer for Toronto, recording 27, 28 and 25 points in his following three seasons. He finally ended his playing career after the 1970–71 season to take an office position in <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs., and also he finished his career with two hundred and ninety-six goals, four goals away from obtaining three hundred.|$|E
5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} {{only a matter of time}} before they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe did not want to see the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E
5|$|Brewer was not {{resigned}} by <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs {{and released}} {{as a free}} agent on July 1, 2015. He spent the entire summer training in hopes of landing an NHL job but realized by mid-August that he was unlikely to find a team interested in his services. He has since quietly retired.|$|E

500|$|Three {{species of}} maple trees are {{predominantly}} {{used to produce}} <b>maple</b> syrup: <b>the</b> sugar <b>maple</b> (Acer saccharum), <b>the</b> black <b>maple</b> (A. nigrum), and <b>the</b> red <b>maple</b> (A. rubrum), {{because of the high}} sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. <b>The</b> black <b>maple</b> is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, <b>the</b> sugar <b>maple,</b> by some botanists. [...] Of these, <b>the</b> red <b>maple</b> has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black <b>maples,</b> which alters <b>the</b> flavour of the sap.|$|R

5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of <b>the</b> <b>maple</b> leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. <b>The</b> <b>maple</b> leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured <b>the</b> <b>maple</b> leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs traded {{him to the}} New York Americans {{along with}} Jimmy Fowler, Murray Armstrong, Doc Romnes and Buzz Boll in {{exchange}} for Sweeney Schriner on May 18, 1939. The five-for-one deal was unprecedented in NHL history at that time.|$|E

5|$|In June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League {{franchise}} {{was purchased}} by a group led by <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs, who relocated them to become the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team. Though the league did not acknowledge that <b>the</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs had an ownership stake in the team, they held a majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%. Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season, Smythe announced that the team would be relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline. The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season. In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to a group from Phoenix, which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.|$|E
