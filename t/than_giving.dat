The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E

5|$|Walter {{was given}} the lordship of Weobley in Herefordshire after the Conquest. He is already attested in the Welsh Marches by 1069, when he is {{recorded}} stopping a Welsh attack and then raiding into Wales in retribution. Walter and Ilbert may have come to England in the household of Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux and half-brother of King William the Conqueror. Although some historians, such as W. E. Wightman, have argued that Walter was a follower of William fitzOsbern, others, including C. P. Lewis and K. S. B. Keats-Rohan, have argued that Walter was an independent agent in England. By the time of Walter's death, he held a block of lands in Herefordshire {{along the border with}} Wales. Another group of lands was centered on Ludlow in Shropshire. These two groupings of lands allowed Walter to help defend the border of England against Welsh raids. Walter also had other lands in Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Oxfordshire. Walter kept a large number of his manors in demesne, managing them directly rather <b>than</b> <b>giving</b> them as fiefs to his knightly followers. Some of these lands in Hereford, including Holme Lacy, were held of the Bishop of Hereford through feudal tenure. In total, Domesday Book records Walter's lands as being worth £423 in income per year and as comprising 163 manors in 7 different counties. He was one of 21 individuals with land valued at more than £400 {{at the time of the}} survey.|$|E

Rather <b>than</b> <b>giving</b> supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the scientific knowledge of biology, astronomy, cosmology and geology known in his time.

25|$|The persecuted Christians fled to Roman territory, {{and were}} welcomed by {{the bishop of}} Constantinople, Atticus, who {{informed}} the Emperor of the persecution. The Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II {{was at the time}} deeply influenced by his religious sister Pulcheria, and had become more and more interested in Christianity. The Roman-Sasanian relationship already had some friction. The Sasanians had hired some Roman gold-diggers, but now refused to send them back; furthermore, the Sasanians seized the properties of Roman merchants. So, when Sasanian ambassadors reached the Roman court to ask for the fugitives, Theodosius choose to break the peace and declare war, rather <b>than</b> <b>giving</b> them back.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} the thinkings of Rawls {{is that it is}} overly {{procedural}} as found in defenders of natural law. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good <b>than</b> <b>giving</b> the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.|$|E

In August 2014, CKMP {{became the subject of}} further notoriety when it changed its format to utilize shortened edits of songs, of around two minutes in length, to double the volume of music played per-hour and maintain listener interest. After only three weeks, the format was dropped and reverted to a standard top 40 format following legal threats by unspecified artists, alongside public complaints by Canadian musician Jann Arden—who felt that the shortened edits were disrespectful to musicians.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties on how to start to the conversation.

25|$|According to Roubi, {{the final}} two {{chapters}} of the Arabic theological novel Fādil ibn Nātiq (c. 1270), also known as Theologus Autodidactus, by the Arabian polymath writer Ibn al-Nafis (12131288) {{can be described as}} science fiction. The theological novel deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, apocalyptic themes, eschatology, resurrection and the afterlife, but rather <b>than</b> <b>giving</b> supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive scientific knowledge in anatomy, biology, physiology, astronomy, cosmology and geology. For example, it was through this novel that Ibn al-Nafis introduces his scientific theory of metabolism, and he makes references to his own scientific discovery of the pulmonary circulation in order to explain bodily resurrection. The novel was later translated into English as Theologus Autodidactus in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The United States did not firmly {{exercise}} {{control over}} Wisconsin until the War of 1812. In 1814, the Americans built Fort Shelby at Prairie du Chien.

The British captured Fort Shelby and renamed it Fort McKay, after Major William McKay, the British commander {{who led the}} forces that won the Battle of Prairie du Chien. However, the 1815 Treaty of Ghent reaffirmed American jurisdiction over Wisconsin, which was by then a part of Illinois Territory. Following the treaty, British troops burned Fort McKay, rather <b>than</b> <b>giving</b> {{it back to the}} Americans, and departed Wisconsin. To protect Prairie du Chien from future attacks, the United States Army constructed Fort Crawford in 1816, on the same site as Fort Shelby. Fort Howard was also built in 1816 in Green Bay.|$|E
