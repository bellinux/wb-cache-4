25|$|Many of Kepler's {{thoughts}} about epistemology {{can be found}} in his Defense of Tycho against Ursus or Contra Ursum (CU), a work which emerged from a polemical framework, the plagiarism conflict between Nicolaus Raimarus Ursus (1551–1600) and Tycho Brahe: causality and physicalization of astronomical theories, the concept and status of astronomical hypotheses, the polemic “realism-instrumentalism”, his criticism of skepticism in general, <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> role of history, etc. Jardine has pointed out that it would be sounder to read Kepler's CU more as a work against skepticism than {{in the context of the}} modern realism/instrumentalism debate.|$|E
25|$|Mind in the ToK system {{refers to}} the set of mental {{behaviors}}. Mental behaviors are behaviors of animals mediated by the nervous system that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting {{a drink of water}} are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with sentience or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental dimension. Cognition, in the broad sense of the term (i.e., as meaning neuro-information processing) is seen as covert mental behavior, whereas change between the animal and the environment is defined as overt mental behavior. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> differences between cognitive and behavioral science.|$|E

40|$|A {{rigorous}} {{link between}} the domains of cost estimation, systems theory and accident investigation reveals fundamental epistemological limitations of commonly employed cost models when dealing with the characteristics of systems, particularly service systems, which may hinder {{the ability to take}} appropriate action for cost reductions. Key points: 1. 	The ability to take action, in particular related to cost reductions in service systems, is strongly influenced by <b>the</b> understanding (<b>epistemological</b> assumptions) underlying a decision-support tool, in this case a cost estimate. 2. 	There is a conflict in <b>the</b> underlying <b>epistemological</b> assumptions about what is and can be known in such a socio-technical system as a service system. 3. 	A managerial perspective of cost estimation which neglects the essential characteristics of service systems may drive behaviour which is locally optimised but creates tension or failure at the system level. 4. 	Cost cutting decisions that are based on a flawed understanding of the situation can lead to counter-intuitive outcomes for organisations; hence practical guidance is needed to help managers consciously consider <b>the</b> underlying <b>epistemological</b> assumptions in a given situation...|$|R

This new worldview arises from the epistemology of unity of knowledge and its functional ontological implication of unity of the world-system. <b>The</b> Kantian <b>epistemological</b> meaning of heteronomy is shown {{to be one of}} the permanent socio-scientific problems of rationalism. The methodology is of the topological mathematical nature by virtue of the complex problem that inheres in the criticism of Kantian heteronomy and rationalism.

500|$|Friedman's essay [...] "The Methodology of Positive Economics" [...] (1953) {{provided}} <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> {{pattern for}} his own subsequent research and {{to a degree that}} of the Chicago School. There he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it to be objective. Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction. That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions'. His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as Jerzy Neyman, Leonard Savage, and Ronald Fisher.|$|E
500|$|The French philosopher, Auguste Comte (1798–1857), {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> {{perspective of}} positivism in The Course in Positivist Philosophy, {{a series of}} texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science: [...] "sociologie". For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex [...] "Queen science" [...] of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'. These are (1) the theological, (2) the metaphysical, and (3) the positive.|$|E
500|$|Many sociologists {{are divided}} into camps of support for {{particular}} research techniques. These disputes relate to <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between theory and data. Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States. In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones {{by a factor of}} two. (Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are qualitative.) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective, and the very term [...] "methodology" [...] is often used synonymously with [...] "statistics." [...] Practically all sociology PhD programmes in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the greater public, though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists.|$|E

500|$|A second {{influence}} on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> outlook called social realism. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective {{in order to}} demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed {{in the form of}} the objective relations of society. As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual's perception of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism. Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves. Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover [...] "apparent" [...] laws, but would be able to discover the inherent nature of society.|$|E
2500|$|Although Althusser {{insists that}} there was an {{epistemological}} break, he later states that its occurrence around 1845 is not clearly defined, as traces of humanism, historicism, and Hegelianism are found in Capital. He states that only Marx's Critique of the Gotha Programme and some marginal notes on a book by Adolph Wagner are fully free from humanist ideology. In line with this, Althusser replaces his earlier definition of Marx's philosophy as the [...] "theory of theoretical practice" [...] with a new belief in [...] "politics in the field of history" [...] and [...] "class struggle in theory". Althusser considers <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> break to be a process instead of a clearly defined event — the product of incessant struggle against ideology. Thus, the distinction between ideology and science or philosophy is not assured once and for all by <b>the</b> <b>epistemological</b> break.|$|E

[...] Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.|$|E
