5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of <b>these</b> <b>teachers</b> whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
5|$|The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, {{also known}} as C.C.D. {{consists}} {{of men and women}} whose mission is to teach the principles of loving and serving God to the children of the parish who do not attend Catholic School. Members of the confraternity serve as teachers in the Sunday Schools of the parish (there are seven different Sunday Schools belonging to Mt. St. Peter's in total). <b>These</b> <b>teachers</b> send out the Catholic messages of faith and love through words, stories, examples, and prayers in order to help the children grow in their faith.

25|$|The {{students}} have different teachers for different subjects, {{and it is}} normal that <b>these</b> <b>teachers</b> stay with a class for an entire course. A teacher usually holds a combined master's degree in two different subjects which are the only subjects which that teacher is qualified to teach. In addition to their university studies, newly employed teachers take a pædagogicum which since August 2009 is a one-year part-time course in pedagogy, having previously been a two-year course.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{issue for the}} education of Negev Bedouin girls is the relative dearth of female teachers. Especially in the post-primary schools, male teachers significantly outnumber female teachers. Of the female teachers, very few are themselves Negev Bedouin. This lack of female teachers means that female students are unable to form relationships with their teachers (as <b>these</b> <b>teachers</b> are male, such a level of interaction would be considered culturally taboo). This shortage of female teachers severely limits girls’ scholastic opportunities, as well as deprives them of potential role models.|$|E
25|$|A highly centralised, {{experimental}} {{public school}} system was installed in 1901 by the Philippine Commission and legislated by Act No. 74. The law exposed a severe shortage of qualified teachers, brought about by large enrollment numbers in schools. As a result, the Philippine Commission authorized the Secretary of Public Instruction to bring more than 1,000 teachers from the United States, who were called the Thomasites, to the Philippines between 1901 and 1902. <b>These</b> <b>teachers</b> were scattered throughout the islands to establish barangay schools. The same law established the Philippine Normal School (now the Philippine Normal University) to train aspiring Filipino teachers.|$|E

40|$|The growing political, {{social and}} {{scientific}} attention {{that is being}} devoted to the moral aspects of teaching has implications for teacher education. This paper reports on {{a study of the}} actual moral education practices of 54 teacher educators within one institution. We encouraged <b>these</b> <b>teacher</b> educators to make their values explicit and to explain how they put them into practice. Nine teacher educators were studied in detail. <b>These</b> <b>teacher</b> educators were then stimulated to reflect on their values by completing charts to analyse the moral aspects of their practices. In addition, one of their lessons was videotaped and discussed. An important conclusion {{of this study is that}} whilst the responsibility for preparing student teachers for moral education rests with individual teacher educators, this process is largely implicit and unplanned. This is due in part to the lack of a language for expressing the moral dimension in teaching. Both teacher educators and students emphasise the importance of the role that attitudes play in the expression of values by teacher educators...|$|R

25|$|The Derg's (1976) Proclamation No: 103 had public {{ownership}} of schools {{consistent with the}} socialist system. This still left a few private schools for children of politicians and wealthy families resulting in a higher quality of education for these children than for all others. Primary schooling expanded throughout the country with national enrolment reaching 34.1%. There were still regional disparities with more resources going to the south than to the north. Educational quality decreased with expansion largely due to resource scarcity. The Derg tried to resolve the problem of teacher shortage by recruiting 5,500 untrained teachers from those who had completed grade 12. <b>These</b> <b>teachers</b> had to attend government designed summer schools for three years to obtain certification.|$|E
25|$|Deleuze {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Paris and lived there for most of his life. His initial {{schooling}} was undertaken during World War II, during which time he attended the Lycée Carnot. He also spent a year in khâgne at the Lycée Henri IV. During the Nazi occupation of France, Deleuze's older brother, Georges, was arrested for his participation in the French Resistance, and died while in transit to a concentration camp. In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the Sorbonne. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as Georges Canguilhem, Jean Hyppolite, Ferdinand Alquié, and Maurice de Gandillac, and Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to <b>these</b> <b>teachers.</b> In addition, Deleuze found the work of non-academic writers such as Jean-Paul Sartre attractive.|$|E

40|$|Background: Teachers' {{conceptions of}} {{learning}} and teaching are partly unconscious. However, they are critical for the delivery of education and affect students' learning outcomes. Lasting changes in teaching behaviour can only be realized if conceptions of teachers have been changed accordingly. Previously we constructed a questionnaire named COLT to measure conceptions. In the present study, we investigated if different teacher profiles could be assessed {{which are based on}} the teachers' conceptions. <b>These</b> <b>teacher</b> profiles might have implications for individual teachers, for faculty development activities and for institutes. Our research questions were: (1) Can we identify teacher profiles based on the COLT? (2) If so, how are <b>these</b> <b>teacher</b> profiles associated with other teacher characteristics? Methods: The COLT questionnaire was sent electronically to all teachers in {{the first three years of}} the undergraduate curriculum of Medicine in two medical schools in the Netherlands with student-centred education. The COLT (18 items, 5 point Likert scales) comprises three scales: 'teacher centredness', 'appreciation of active learning' and 'orientation to professional practice'. We also collected personal information about the participants and their occupational characteristics. Teacher profiles were studied using a K-means cluster analysis and calculating Chi squares. Results: The response rate was 49. 4 % (N = 319 / 646). A five-cluster solution fitted the data best, resulting in five teacher profiles based on their conceptions as measured by the COLT. We named the teacher profiles: Transmitters (most traditional), Organizers, Intermediates, Facilitators and Conceptual Change Agents (most modern). The teacher profiles differed from each other in personal and occupational characteristics. Conclusions: Based on teachers' conceptions {{of learning and}} teaching, five teacher profiles were found in student-centred education. We offered suggestions how insight into <b>these</b> <b>teacher</b> profiles might be useful for individual teachers, for faculty development activities and for institutes and departments, especially if involved in a curriculum reform towards student-centred education...|$|R
25|$|In 1901 {{at least}} five hundred {{teachers}} (365 males and 165 females) arrived from the U.S. aboard the USS Thomas. The name Thomasite was adopted for <b>these</b> <b>teachers,</b> who firmly established education as one of America's major contributions to the Philippines. Among the assignments given were Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, and Masbate. Twenty-seven of the original Thomasites either died of tropical diseases or were murdered by Filipino rebels during their first 20 months of residence. Despite the hardships, the Thomasites persisted, teaching and building learning institutions that prepared students for their chosen professions or trades. They opened the Philippine Normal School (now Philippine Normal University) and the Philippine School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) in 1901 and reopened the Philippine Nautical School, established in 1839 by the Board of Commerce of Manila under Spain. By the end of 1904, primary courses were mostly taught by Filipinos under American supervision.|$|E

500|$|The early form of {{training}} under Ueshiba was noticeably different from later forms of aikido. It had a larger curriculum, {{increased use of}} strikes to vital points (atemi) and a greater use of weapons. The schools of aikido developed by Ueshiba's students from the pre-war period tend to reflect the harder style of the early training. These students included Kenji Tomiki (who founded the Shodokan Aikido sometimes called Tomiki-ryū), Noriaki Inoue (who founded Shin'ei Taidō), Minoru Mochizuki (who founded Yoseikan Budo) and Gozo Shioda (who founded Yoshinkan Aikido).

500|$|In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, {{studying}} composition with Fauré, {{and taking}} private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge. Both <b>these</b> <b>teachers,</b> particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his {{development as a}} composer. As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported [...] "a distinct gain in maturity... engaging wealth of imagination". Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois, who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook. Consequently, according to a fellow-student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, he was [...] "a marked man, against whom all weapons were good". He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900. As a former student {{he was allowed to}} attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating [...] "auditeur" [...] until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903.|$|E

2500|$|By using Piaget’s theory, {{educators}} {{focus on}} their students as learners. As {{a result of this}} focus, education is learner-center and constructivist-based to an extent.

[...] Teachers who use a learner-centered approach as a basis for their professional practices incorporate the several dispositions. They provide experience-based educational opportunities. <b>These</b> <b>teachers</b> also contemplate the learners’ individual qualities and attitudes during curriculum planning.
