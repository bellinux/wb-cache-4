5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in <b>this</b> <b>sector</b> was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In <b>this</b> <b>sector,</b> Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E

Despite persistent pleas to reinforce <b>this</b> <b>sector,</b> Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E

5|$|By {{this point}} XXXVI Corps had reached total exhaustion. With the {{transfer}} of the SS Division Nord to the south, and a return of the Finnish 6th Division to III Corps, Feige deemed any further advance in <b>this</b> <b>sector</b> impossible. With the Soviets bringing more reinforcements to the front every day, Feige requested more men if he was to start a new attack. Plans were made by AOK Norwegen for a resumption of the offensive, but the German High Command was unable to reinforce the Arctic theatre with additional units and AOK Norwegen could not send anything meaningful itself to aid Feige. Consequently, all offensive plans were scrapped. Due to the more spectacular gains at the main front in Central Russia during Operation Barbarossa, the OKW deemed the current situation acceptable and an end was ordered to the offensive operations of XXXVI Corps. This, combined with heavy German casualties, led to the attack finally being called off at the end of September.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{argue that}} the {{recently}} discovered integrability in the large-N CFT/AdS system is equivalent to diffractionless scattering of the corresponding hidden elementary excitations. This suggests that, perhaps, the key tool for finding the spectrum of this system is neither the gauge theory’s dilatation operator nor the string sigma model’s quantum Hamiltonian, but instead the respective factorized S-matrix. To illustrate the idea, {{we focus on the}} closed fermionic su(1 | 1) sector of the N = 4 gauge theory. We introduce a new technique, the perturbative asymptotic Bethe ansatz, and use it to extract <b>this</b> <b>sector’s</b> three-loop S-matrix from Beisert’s involved algebraic work on the three-loop su(2 | 3) sector. We then show that the current knowledge about semiclassical and near-plane-wave quantum strings in the su(2), su(1 | 1) and sl(2) sectors of AdS 5 ×S 5 is fully consistent with the existence of a factorized S-matrix. Analyzing the available information, we find an intriguing relation between the three associated S-matrices. Assuming that the relation also holds in gauge theory, we derive the three-loop S-matrix of the sl(2) <b>sector</b> even though <b>this</b> <b>sector’s</b> dilatation operator is not yet known beyond one loop.
