Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by Voyager 2. In particular, {{it seems that the}} Liberté arc might disappear in as little as one century.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{research}} in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey {{confirmed that the}} separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> Some biologists believe that these {{should be regarded as}} separate subspecies and that they are evolving independently.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} found some {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution range and population size for each of such distinct species are smaller <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the archaeological}} {{excavation}} at the Yenikapı Marmaray construction site, {{it has been}} learned that Istanbul's history dates back further <b>than</b> was <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> some 8,500 years.|$|R

5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from eastern Asia to be discovered. It {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{estimates}} from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed {{almost entirely of}} water ice. However, based {{on the effects of}} Enceladus's gravity on Cassini, its mass was determined to be much higher <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> yielding a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, a re-survey using {{satellite}} technology established its summit (known as Low's Peak) height at 4095 m above sea level, which is some 6 m less <b>than</b> the <b>previously</b> <b>thought</b> and hitherto published figure of 4101 m.|$|R
25|$|A tiny {{fragment}} of zircon dating back 4.4 billion {{years has been}} confirmed as the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. It provides evidence that a solid crust formed much earlier in the planet's history <b>than</b> was <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the British withdrew, the Americans did not re-garrison Ogdensburg. The British {{were able}} to {{purchase}} supplies from Americans merchants there {{for the remainder of}} the war. The Ogdensburg area may have been populated by more Tories and Federalists <b>than</b> was <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Although {{numbers have}} {{declined}} steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is only found with trees known to form mycorrhiza, and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{full text}} of the Hexapla is no longer extant. Some {{portions}} were discovered in Milan indicating {{that at least some}} individual parts existed much longer <b>than</b> was <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> The Hexapla has been referred to by later manuscripts and authors, and represented the precursor to the parallel bible.|$|R
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Fowler could miss the rest of the 2007–08 season for Cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> Surgeons were forced to perform a micro-fracture in order for the hip to heal properly. Despite this, he attempted to make a comeback {{at the end of the}} season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the 18-man match squad. He did not feature in the game in and thus did not receive a runners-up medal having not made an appearance in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by {{the fact that there is}} a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Retraction Watch has {{demonstrated}} that retractions are more common <b>than</b> was <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> When Retraction Watch was launched, Marcus [...] "wondered if we'd have enough material". It had been estimated that about 80 papers were retracted annually. However, in its first year, the blog reported on approximately 200 retractions.|$|R
50|$|Leon Festinger {{highlighted}} in 1957 the discomfort caused people by awareness of inconsistent thought. Rationalization can reduce such discomfort by explaining away the discrepancy in question, as when {{people who take}} up smoking after previously quitting decide that the evidence for it being harmful is less <b>than</b> they <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fossil {{is unusual}} and scientifically {{valuable}} because soft tissue including skin and muscle have been fossilized, giving researchers the {{rare opportunity to}} study more than bones, as with most vertebrate fossils.

5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in diurnal temperature variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{reactivation}} {{increases with}} immunosuppression, {{such as that}} caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with M. tuberculosis and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year. Studies using DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought,</b> with estimates that it might {{account for more than}} 50% of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common. The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4% as of 2008, down from 8% in 1995.|$|E

5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 2000s, {{molecular}} {{studies have}} revealed that the widely distributed African, Eurasian, and Australian genus Miniopterus is much more species-rich <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> In a 1995 contribution to Faune de Madagascar on Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues listed four species of Miniopterus on Madagascar and the nearby Comoros, including the small Miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the Comoros. In 2008 and 2009, however, Steven Goodman and colleagues presented evidence that the former concept of M.manavi in fact encompassed five morphologically and molecularly distinct species of small Miniopterus. These included M.manavi itself in the Central Highlands, M.griveaudi and M.aelleni in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar, M.brachytragos in northern and western Madagascar only, and M.mahafaliensis in southwestern Madagascar. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls {{and came to the}} conclusion that the two species are more distinct <b>than</b> <b>previously</b> <b>thought.</b> The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E
