40|$|Using the London equation, we derive {{a formula}} by which <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> force from {{magnetic}} dots can be cal-culated. We numerically calculate {{the interaction between}} ferromagnetic dots and vortices in type II super-conductors under various conditions. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> force of <b>the</b> magnetic dot with 50 nm thick-ness reaches 3. 5 × 10 - 11 N that is one order magnitude stronger than <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>pinning</b> force in cuprate at 77 K. We investigate various parameter dependences of <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> force. It is found that {{the most effective way}} to increase <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> force is to increase the thickness of <b>the</b> dot. <b>The</b> <b>pinning</b> force is weakly de-pendent on both the size and magnetic permeability of the dots. When temperature increases, <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> force linearly decreases. And when the magnetic field increases, the attraction force increases linearly in the low field region...|$|R

50|$|The {{teeth of}} the {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT are formed by pins that extend from one pulley half to the other pulley half and slide in the grooves of the pulley halves of the variator pulley. Here torque from the chain is transferred to <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> and then from <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> to <b>the</b> pulley halves. Since <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> are round and the grooves are curved, line contact between <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> and <b>the</b> grooves are used to transfer force from <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> to <b>the</b> grooves. The amount of force that can be transmitted between two parts depend on the contact area of the two parts. Since the contact areas between <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> and their grooves are very small, the amount of force that can be transmitted between them, and hence also the torque capacity of an iCVT, is limited.|$|R

30|$|Note that <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> control {{problem has}} been {{introduced}} {{to the study of}} Boolean networks in some recent works [33, 34]. With <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> control, we can realize the control objective by controlling a small number of nodes. Using the ASSR framework, <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> control design for the stabilization of Boolean networks was studied in [34], and a novel design procedure was established. Moreover, in GRNs, some states and inputs are undesirable because they may lead to a dangerous situation such as the deterioration of a disease, the metastasis of a cancer [7, 35], and so on. Hence, we need put some constraints to the undesirable states and inputs in BCNs. It should be noticed that <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> control design for feedback stabilization of constrained BCNs is still a challenging problem, and there are fewer results on this problem. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> stabilization control design procedure proposed in [34] cannot be directly applied to <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> control design for feedback stabilization of constrained BCNs. This motivates us to study <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> control design for feedback stabilization of constrained BCNs.|$|R
