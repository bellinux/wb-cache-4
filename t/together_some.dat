Lennon wrote the bulk of the new material, contributing 14 songs. Lennon and McCartney brought home-recorded demos to the session, and worked on them <b>together.</b> <b>Some</b> home demos and group sessions at Kinfauns were later released on the 1996 compilation Anthology 3.|$|E

Hangman's Wood and Deneholes has deneholes, shafts created by medieval chalk mining which are now used by hibernating bats.

5|$|Mooppanar, {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} based in Thanjavur, had purchased a Williamson 35 mm {{camera and a}} printer in England. R. Nataraja Mudaliar, then an automobile dealer in Madras, bought the equipment from him at a price of less than 2,000. Nataraja Mudaliar developed a passion for moving pictures after watching the films of Dadasaheb Phalke. During the administration of Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, cinematographers from Britain were filming a documentary on him. Nataraja Mudaliar met Stewart Smith, one of the cinematographers {{who worked in the}} documentary, and learned about the basics of photography in film-making through him. This eventually led to Nataraja Mudaliar establishing his production house, India Film Company. He brought <b>together</b> <b>some</b> of his business associates, who invested in the production house, and established South India's first film studio in 1915 on Miller's Road, Purasawalkam, Madras.|$|E

5|$|The finder {{discovered}} the helmet and visor buried <b>together</b> <b>some</b> 25cm (10in) below the surface, {{at a site}} located on a ledge {{at the lower end}} of the settlement. It had been placed onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top. The helmet was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial. The visor was mostly intact and had been placed face down. The griffin had become detached and was found with the helmet. No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.|$|E

Meanwhile, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) has agreed to be a surrogate mother for her brother Frank (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp), but is concerned that they are paying $16,000 for the IVF procedure which only has a 25% chance of success, and is helpless to influence the results.|$|E
5|$|John Robson left Palace {{to manage}} {{neighbours}} Croydon Common F.C for the 1907–08 season, and Edmund Goodman {{took over as}} manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. Bill Davies became the first player from the club to win an international honour when he was called up for Wales. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing the league in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup they fell to their heaviest defeat, a second round replay to Burnley which finished 0–9, a record defeat for Palace and a record victory for Burnley. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish again the following season, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the London Challenge Cup in 1913, overcoming West Ham United 1–0. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913–14 season, the club putting <b>together</b> <b>some</b> long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to Swindon Town on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at Highbury, and provided their first England representative in Horace Colclough, who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 1806, Warren's {{squadron}} was cruising in the Eastern Atlantic. Most of {{the squadron}} were grouped to the northwest, but HMS London under Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale and the flagship HMS Foudroyant under Captain John Chambers White were sailing <b>together</b> <b>some</b> {{distance from the}} rest of the British force, in company with the frigate HMS Amazon under Captain William Parker. At 03:00, sails were spotted to the north-east by lookouts on London. Hastening in pursuit with the wind from the south-west, Captain Neale signalled the location of the strange ships to Warren with blue lights, the admiral following with Amazon and the rest of the squadron trailing behind. To the north-east, Linois had also sighted sails in the distance and turned Marengo south-west in pursuit, anticipating a third encounter with a valuable merchant convoy. Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac of Belle Poule insisted that the sails were from British warships, but Linois over-ruled him, arguing that any warships would be part of the convoy's escort and could be avoided in the night. It was not until 05:30, when London appeared from the gloom just ahead of Marengo that Linois realised his mistake. He attempted to escape, but his ships had been at sea for an extended period and were sluggish compared to the 98-gun London, which rapidly came alongside the French ship of the line and opened a heavy fire.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put <b>together</b> <b>some</b> demos to present the {{technology}} to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E
