5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis {{why he was}} so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon. Feynman said that that {{sometimes}} bothered him, too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> even when he was dead he would not be completely gone.|$|E
500|$|Back then I didn't {{realize the}} power of my character. [...] I didn't realize the image I had created and what it meant <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> [...] Ruth was so underwritten, so what I {{was able to bring}} to it was what made it special to me. [...] The looks, the affection, the pats on the head, the tone and inflection. [...] I got to bring that to her character, and that was all I thought there was. [...] I didn't know what was being {{received}} {{on the other side of}} the screen.|$|E
500|$|... "As {{her film}} {{brought her to}} life, Santoshi Ma quickly {{became one of the}} most {{important}} and widely worshiped goddesses in India, taking her place in poster-art form in the altar rooms of millions of Hindu homes. [...] Yet it is hard to conceive that Santoshi Ma could have granted such instant satisfaction <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> had she not been part of a larger and already well-integrated culture of the Goddess. Her new devotees could immediately recognize many of her characteristic moods and attributes, and feel them deeply, because she shared them with other goddesses long since familiar to them." ...|$|E

500|$|Herpes {{has been}} known for at least 2,000 years. Emperor Tiberius is said to have banned kissing in Rome for a time due <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> having cold sores. In the 16th-century Romeo and Juliet, [...] {{blisters}} [...] "o'er ladies' lips" [...] are mentioned. In the 18th century, it was so common among prostitutes that it was called [...] "a vocational disease of women". The term 'herpes simplex' appeared in Richard Boulton's A System of Rational and Practical Chirurgery in 1713, where the terms 'herpes miliaris' and 'herpes exedens' also appeared. Herpes was not found to be a virus until the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, on 4 February 2010, he {{announced}} his decision to retire, after discussing the matter at {{a meeting with the}} Board of Directors of the Sumo Association. He stated, [...] "I feel heavy responsibility as a yokozuna that I have caused trouble <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> I am the only person who can put an end to it all. I think it's my destiny that I retire like this." [...] Asashōryū did not comment directly on the brawl, except to say that what actually happened was [...] "quite different" [...] to media reports. [...] "I decided to step down to bring this to a closure." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{accompanying}} Songz on 106 & Park when promoting, Ready, Drake {{explained the}} video, stating: [...] "The {{concept of the}} video {{is the fact that}} 'successful,' it applies <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> that me and Trey just want to get the point across that we see ourselves and we see success in other individuals so really, it's a video about potential. It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which {{is one of my favorite}} quotes I've ever read, so we decided to put it in the video. It's vivid." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was unusual}} for a {{television}} show of the 1950s <b>to</b> have <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> killed, and later shows, for whatever reason, did not have as <b>many</b> <b>people</b> killed as this first pilot episode.|$|R
50|$|Another anecdote {{suggests}} that at her hinting, Jahandar Shah once ordered the entire crew {{as well as}} their passengers to abandon a boat, purely so she could satisfy her curiosity <b>to</b> watch <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> drown.|$|R
30|$|Permanent out-migration – as {{previously}} noted, registers probably include more immigrants than actually {{reside in the}} country because, {{in spite of the}} requirement <b>to</b> do <b>so,</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> emigrate from Denmark and Sweden without informing the relevant authorities.|$|R
500|$|Peirce {{wanted to}} tell the story from Brandon's perspective. She was {{familiar}} with Brandon's desire to wear men's clothing: [...] "I started looking at all the other coverage {{and a great deal of}} it was sensational. People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." [...] Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, [...] "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E
2500|$|... he {{promotes}} {{the definition of}} art as experience, assuming that it could “effect the artistic legitimation” of popular art (e.g., “rock music”) “which affords such frequent and intensely gratifying aesthetic experience <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> from so many nations, cultures, and classes”; ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I suppose that's {{why it is}} I am always so {{interested}} in these affairs. I have helped <b>to</b> marry <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in this place, that I'm almost afraid to stir out after dark." ...|$|R
25|$|Andrew {{was also}} on-air during the 2007 summer floods {{and found himself}} {{presenting}} a news programme from 7pm until midnight instead of his new music programme, receiving top praise from Mark Thompson, director-general of the BBC at the time, who said: “The feedback you’ve received from your audience has offered ample testimony of just how essential that service has been <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people’s</b> lives. We could never hope to keep them informed and connected {{were it not for}} the kind of efforts you've made, and the professionalism and creativity that you've demonstrated”. This resulted in the station receiving gold in the Sony Radio Academy Awards.|$|R
50|$|Agent McCarty {{consoles}} David as {{he deals}} {{with the fact that}} he had <b>to</b> kill <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> and assures him that Logan will be caught. Milla apologizes to David as she is escorted away, and McCarty assures David that she is in good hands.|$|R
2500|$|... "When I {{think back}} to it, {{it was such a}} crucial point <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> we didn't even realise back then but it showed us what we would be doing for the next year of our lives. We were never nervous about Anette, or the album being good, but we just couldn't tell how people would take it. Would they like Anette? Would they like the music? That was in the back of our minds all the time. And there was such a huge amount of money involved, over 800.000 euros, that we needed to sell at least a few albums to get going," [...] Tuomas Holopainen was recalling in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{memorial}} was {{in storage}} after November 2014, while two planning applications were submitted, and fundraising efforts made {{to cover the}} cost of its manufacture, plinth design and installation ceremony (which had originally planned for Armistice Day in November 2016). Planning permission was finally granted on 28 September 2016. When the Prince of Wales visited the Black Cultural Archives in February 2017 and was made aware of the memorial, he said in a speech:"It’s so encouraging that now, at last, you have a centre such as this, which allows you to develop so many opportunities but also to bring the message <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in this country and elsewhere about the remarkable contribution made over so long, by people of African and Caribbean descent who have contributed so much to this country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, Anna {{insists on}} a visit to the town. [...] "Tom" [...] is deathly afraid of being so close <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> LaFarge {{promises}} to keep him close, but at the town they become separated. While searching for [...] "Tom", LaFarge hears that the Spaulding family in town has miraculously found their lost daughter Lavinia. Desperate to avoid a second devastating heartbreak to his wife, LaFarge stands outside Spaulding's home and finds [...] "Tom" [...] now masquerading as Lavinia. He is able to coax [...] "Tom" [...] to come back, and they run desperately back for their boat to leave town. However, everyone [...] "Tom" [...] passes sees someone significant to them—a lost husband, a son, a criminal. The Martian, exhausted from his constant shape-changing, spasms and dies.|$|E
50|$|On February 24, 2012, Tokyo {{governor}} Shintaro Ishihara {{said that}} he also believes that the Nanjing massacre never happened. He reportedly claims {{it would have been}} impossible <b>to</b> kill <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in such a short period of time. He believes the actual death toll was 10,000.|$|R
5000|$|About {{the release}} {{and the history}} of the label, Robotic Empire's head Andy Low said: [...] "It has been a {{privilege}} <b>to</b> introduce <b>so</b> <b>many</b> unique bands <b>to</b> like-minded freaks over the past 15 years. Looking back at what's transpired almost seems unreal, and even with a shameful carbon footprint of many thousand plastic circles — I can safely say that it has been an honor to work with the artists we have, and a hearty thank you is due to all who've listened thus far. I genuinely hope you'll enjoy this tribute to one of the bands who first showed me the strange side of music. Nirvana was truly one of the greats, and we've done our best to craft an appropriate homage <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people's</b> all-time favorite band." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was an odd}} sight <b>to</b> see <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> moving rapidly, {{but without}} noise, while neither cart nor animal of any kind {{accompanied}} them. Here and there were men carrying burdens on their backs by aid of a strap passed around the forehead, and many women and children literally loaded down with flowers.|$|R
2500|$|Gordon Parks was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film, and though he was disillusioned by his experience {{with the release of}} his 1976 feature film Leadbelly, he anticipated a different experience in television. After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, [...] "Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting and not go overboard, although it's very difficult not to when you know so much happened that was so bad <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> But there were things I had to change." [...] Five historical advisers assisted with the film, though Parks said he felt pressured [...] "to keep it toned down".|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, many {{teachers}} of English still admonish students against using split infinitives in writing. Because the prohibition {{has become so}} widely known, the Columbia Guide recommends that writers [...] "follow the conservative path , especially when you're uncertain of your readers' expectations and sensitivities in this matter". Likewise, the Oxford Dictionaries do not regard the split infinitive as ungrammatical, but on balance consider it likely to produce a weak style and advise against its use for formal correspondence. [...] R. W. Burchfield's revision of Fowler's Modern English Usage goes farther (quoting Burchfield's own 1981 book The Spoken Word): [...] "Avoid splitting infinitives whenever possible, but do not suffer undue remorse if a split infinitive is unavoidable for {{the completion of a}} sentence already begun." [...] Still more strongly, the style guide of The Economist says, [...] "Happy the man who has never been told that it is wrong to split an infinitive: the ban is pointless. Unfortunately, to see it broken is so annoying <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> that you should observe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She will be immensely {{run after}} as Lady Fawn. When she pleases {{she can make}} her own house quite charming. I never knew {{a woman who could}} say pretty things <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> at once." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} first settled by Europeans in 1768, when Scottish {{physician}} Dr. Andrew Turnbull, {{a friend of}} James Grant, the governor of British East Florida, established the colony of New Smyrna, named after the home town of his father-in-law. No one had previously attempted <b>to</b> settle <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> at one time in a town in North America.|$|R
60|$|You can see by the story, {{that the}} London Company had set for Captain Newport {{a very great}} task when they {{commanded}} him <b>to</b> do what <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> had failed in before him.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{as he led}} the heavy, silk-hatted man {{back towards}} the group, he caught MacIan's ear in order to whisper: [...] "This poor gentleman is mad; he thinks he is Edward VII." [...] At this the self-appointed Creator {{slightly}} winked. [...] "Of course you won't trust him much; come to me for everything. But in my position one has <b>to</b> meet <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> One has <b>to</b> be broadminded." ...|$|R
60|$|There were, in fact, so {{many things}} to be {{attended}} <b>to,</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> to be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal could hold out.|$|E
60|$|At {{the ticket}} office {{he found that}} the clerk remembered very little. He knew the old gentleman well by sight, indeed, but was in the habit of selling tickets <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> that it was {{impossible}} for him to remember where they booked to. In fact the only thing that had fixed Mr Leather at all in his memory {{was the fact that the}} old man had dropped his ticket, had no money to take another, and had pleaded earnestly to let him have one on trust, a request with which he dared not comply--but fortunately, a porter found and restored the ticket.|$|E
60|$|Being in Rome, as aforesaid, Pierston {{returned}} {{one evening}} {{to his hotel}} to dine, after spending the afternoon among the busts in the long gallery of the Vatican. The unconscious habit, common <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> of tracing likes in unlikes had often led him to discern, or to fancy he discerned, in the Roman atmosphere, in its lights and shades, and particularly in its reflected or secondary lights, something resembling the atmosphere of his native promontory. Perhaps it was that in each case the eye was mostly resting on stone--that the quarries of ruins in the Eternal City {{reminded him of the}} quarries of maiden rock at home.|$|E
40|$|The rise of Nazism brought horror, humiliation, {{death and}} torture <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> free-thinking <b>people</b> - Jews, and other minorities. There were some lucky ones, like the Weisskopf family, {{who were able}} to escape. Victor Weisskopf was born and brought up in Austria in the spirit of German culture and said that he {{considered}} his transfer from Europe to the USA an invaluable source of intellectual enrichment (2 pages) ...|$|R
25|$|In 1970, he was {{selected}} {{to serve on the}} Grand Jury, and volunteered for the Committee on Courts Enforcement, which looked into the electoral system in Alameda County.

It is surrounded by extensive woodlands, stretching to Eden's Fork (exit 106, near Kanawha Twomile Creek).
