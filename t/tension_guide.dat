40|$|The {{incidence}} of fractures of the humerus has increased exponentially in recent years. The most used classifications for humerus fracture are morphological (Neer), biological (AO/ASIF) and descriptive (Hertel). The types of surgical treatment for humerus fracture include prosthetic replacement and synthesis using different devices, including the <b>Tension</b> <b>Guide</b> Fixator (TGF), Gex-Fix. External fixation for displaced proximal humeral fractures avoids dissection and soft tissue stripping {{and has been}} reported by some authors {{to be associated with}} higher union rates, a lower {{incidence of}} avascular necrosis, less scarring of the scapulohumeral interface, and faster rehabilitation compared with open reduction and internal fixation. Other authors have reported that external fixation does not ensure acceptable reduction and fracture stability, particularly in patients with osteoporosis. The external fixation technique involves the introduction of Steinmann's pin to keep manual reduction, the introduction of two K-wires in the humeral head, the removal of the Steinmann's pin, and the introduction of two fiches on the humeral shaft. Hub connectors are mounted on the wires and on the chips to connect the outer bar and tensioning system. A total of 84 patients aged 42 - 84 years with proximal end humeral fractures (66 % had two-part fractures) were treated with Fixator TGF in this study from December 2007 to June 2012. The postoperative recovery was earlier and the active-assisted motion was less painful than has been reported with other surgical techniques. The TGF was removed without anaesthesia at the outpatient clinic at a mean of 7 weeks (range 5 - 8 weeks) after surgery, and there was no loss of reduction or secondary displacement after removal. These results, after five years of experience, confirm that the best indication for this fixator is two- or three-part fractures because the device enables early active mobilisation. The limitations of this fixator are evident in fractures in which closed reduction is not possible and in three-part fractures with varus displacement because the TGF has less stability than other systems, such as the plate or cage. The short learning curve, reduced surgical time and risk, and low cost encourage the use of this technique...|$|E
40|$|Breast cancer {{incidence}} in the United States is I in 8, {{and over}} 90 % {{of breast cancer}} related deaths are due to metastases, secondary tumors at a site distant from the primary tumor. Metastasis formation requires carcinoma cells to navigate through the tumor microenvironment and invade the surrounding stroma. Migration is a highly orchestrated process in which cells are guided by both internal signals and signals from the microenvironment. Hence, understanding the mechanisms that guide cell migration in response to various stimuli in the tumor and stromal microenvironments is key to developing therapies that prevent tumor cell migration and render cancer more treatable. Osmotic and hydrostatic pressure gradients within the extracellular matrix (ECM) drive flow of interstitial fluid through the ECM. Elevated osmotic pressure, lymphatic collapse, solid stress, and increased microvascular permeability contribute to elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) during carcinoma progression, and high intratumoral IFP leads to pressure gradients at the tumor margin, which drive fluid flow that emanates from the tumor core to drain in the surrounding stroma. In this thesis, we explore the effect of interstitial flow (IF) on tumor cell migration. We developed a microfluidic platform to apply repeatable, robust IF through tissue constructs consisting of human metastatic breast cancer cells embedded within a 3 D collagen type I matrix. We implemented the microfluidic device to validate CCR 7 -mediated autologous chemotaxis as a mechanism that guides downstream migration in response to IF. However, we identified a separate competing pathway that drives cell migration upstream (rheotaxis). Rheotaxis results from asymmetry in matrix adhesion stress that is required to balance fluid drag imparted by IF on tumor cells. Thus, autologous chemotaxis, mediated by chemical transport, and rheotaxis, mediated by fluid stresses, compete to direct cell migration downstream or upstream in response to IF. Our results provide insight into mechanotransduction in 3 D porous media and into the mechanisms by which asymmetries in matrix adhesion <b>tension</b> <b>guide</b> cell migration. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the consideration of IF is crucial for understanding and treating metastatic disease.

50|$|Because {{the data}} rate was 5.8 million bits-per-second (5.8mbp/s), {{significant}} error detection and correction was required. A custom designed Reed-Solomon block code, was used with additional CRC characters for error correction. Interleaving of odd and even audio samples {{was performed to}} protect against burst errors. Just as in audio tape machines, transport problems with <b>tension,</b> <b>guides,</b> and supply and take-up reels could result in vertical or horizontal weave, and as bit sizes were only 14μm, precise timing and tracking was essential, thus the CDS system required installation of special projector modifications to smooth the film path travel and steady the take-up speed. It was found later, however, that modifications to the projectors were not needed and that the CDS systems sensitivity to improper film speed was due to a diode installed incorrectly in the CDS decoder module. Horizontal tracking was provided by a 76-MHz digital servo, while vertical timing was accomplished with an algorithm written into the data format itself. Rows of data were scanned horizontally, thus a self-clocking run-length-limited code was used for this error correction. A 6-to-8-bit mapping was performed upon encoding to ensure that each 8-bit word contained exactly four ones. This form of parity worked well in correcting errors upon decoding.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of social programs to a diverse population creates a legitimate {{concern that the}} findings of evaluations be widely credible. The weaker are the assumptions imposed, the more widely credible are the findings. The classical argument for random assignment of treatments is viewed by many as enabling evaluation under weak assumptions, and has generated much interest {{in the conduct of}} experiments. But the classical argument does impose assumptions, and there often is good reason to doubt their realism. Some researchers, finding the classical assumptions implausible, impose other assumptions strong enough to identify treatment effects of interest. In contrast, the recent literature examined in this article explores the inferences that may be drawn from experimental data under assumptions weak enough to yield widely credible findings. This literature has two branches. One seeks out notions of treatment effect that are identified when the experimental data are combined with weak assumptions. The canonical finding is that the average treatment effect within some context-specific subpopulation is identified. The other branch specifies a population of a priori interest and seeks to learn about treatment effects in this population. Here the canonical finding is a bound on average treatment effects. The various approaches to the analysis of experiments are complementary from a mathematical perspective, but in <b>tension</b> as <b>guides</b> to evaluation practice.

40|$|SummarySubdividing proliferating tissues into {{compartments}} is an evolutionarily conserved {{strategy of}} animal development [1 – 6]. Signals across boundaries between compartments {{can result in}} local expression of secreted proteins organizing growth and patterning of tissues [1 – 6]. Sharp and straight interfaces between compartments are crucial for stabilizing the position of such organizers and therefore for precise implementation of body plans. Maintaining boundaries in proliferating tissues requires mechanisms to counteract cell rearrangements caused by cell division; however, the nature of such mechanisms remains unclear. Here we quantitatively analyzed cell morphology and {{the response to the}} laser ablation of cell bonds {{in the vicinity of the}} anteroposterior compartment boundary in developing Drosophila wings. We found that mechanical tension is approximately 2. 5 -fold increased on cell bonds along this compartment boundary as compared to the remaining tissue. Cell bond tension is decreased in the presence of Y- 27632 [7], an inhibitor of Rho-kinase whose main effector is Myosin II [8]. Simulations using a vertex model [9] demonstrate that a 2. 5 -fold increase in local cell bond <b>tension</b> suffices to <b>guide</b> the rearrangement of cells after cell division to maintain compartment boundaries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A high-throughput, low-volume {{microfluidic}} device {{has been designed}} to decouple the physical processes of protein crystal nucleation and growth. This device, called the Phase Chip, is constructed out of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer. One of the Phase Chip’s innovations is to exploit surface <b>tension</b> forces to <b>guide</b> each drop to a storage chamber. We demonstrate that nanoliter water-in-oil drops of protein solutions can be rapidly stored in individual wells, thereby allowing the screening of 1000 conditions while consuming a total of only 10 µg of protein on a 20 cm 2 chip. Another significant advance over current {{microfluidic device}}s is that each well is in contact with a reservoir via a dialysis membrane through which only water and other low-molecular-weight organic solvents can pass, but not salt, polymer, or protein. This enables the concentration of all solutes in a solution to be reversibly, rapidly, and precisely varied in contrast to current methods, such as the free interface diffusion or sitting drop methods, which are irreversible. The Phase Chip operates by first optimizing conditions for nucleation by using dialysis to supersaturate the protein solution, which leads to nucleation of many small crystals. Next, conditions are optimized for crystal growth by using dialysis to reduce the protein and precipitant concentrations, which leads small crystals to dissolve while simultaneously causing only the largest ones to grow, ultimately resulting in the transformation of many small, unusable crystals into a few large ones...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT There {{has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in the inclusion of ethics as part of educators 2 ̆ 7 training and interest in understanding the moral and ethical dimensions of educational practice. This research was designed to study the types of dilemmas school level leaders face, the characteristics of typical dilemmas, and the implications for leader preparation, professional development, and practice. In documenting the lived experiences of former school level leaders, the grounded theory approach to qualitative inquiry and the critical incident technique (CIT) were employed. Data collected from interview sessions, dialogs, journals and reflections were used to analyze the types of dilemmas school level leaders faced, the characteristics of typical dilemmas, and the implications for leader preparation, professional development, and practice. This study confirmed the prevalence of ethical dilemmas for school level leadership. The critical incidents shared by the participants revealed that school leaders were guided by district policies and experienced dissonance or <b>tension</b> between their <b>guiding</b> ethical beliefs and policies or expectations of the district. The data determined that school level leaders sought to act {{in the best interests of}} students. Participants acknowledged that the core of their ethical and moral fiber was developed early in their youth and was reinforced by pivotal life experiences. This acknowledgement suggested that pivotal life experiences could influence an individual 2 ̆ 7 s ethical and moral fiber. The findings also indicated that professional development in ethics could be effective for school level leaders. Additionally, the data revealed a dichotomy around whether ethics could be taught. The findings were inconclusive in determining how race and/or gender played a significant role in the dilemmas that school level leaders face or the resolution of the dilemmas. Further research and study of this issue may be warranted in light of the changing demographics of our schools, communities, and school level leaders. Critical reflection proved to be a process that could benefit practicing and aspiring school level leaders. Exploring how this process could be implemented in school leader preparation and professional development programs is a phenomenon worthy of further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{computing}} and information technology has enabled pervasive access to the World Wide Web. Over 280 EB of digital data has been generated {{from around the world}} and flowing in the digital universe; as a result, the need for data storage has grown rapidly. A variety of information storage solutions such as hard disk drive (HDD) products that are common information storages for personal computing are available in the market. Modern magnetic tape data storage in terms of its capacity and reliability has been employed as an ideal solution for enterprise-level storage of archival data with applications that include financial records, satellite images, and consumer databases. In magnetic tape technology, the thin, flexible media is transported between the supply and take up packs at a prescribed speed and <b>tension,</b> and over <b>guides</b> and the read/write head. As the tape is transported, in-plane vibration of axially moving tape, known as lateral tape motion (LTM), arises from excitation sources such as the run out of tape pack and impacts between the tape and the flanges on guides or packs. LTM has been identified as a major factor that degrades recording accuracy. Limiting the LTM is the one of the keys that enables the multi-terabytes data storage, and flanged roller guides are commonly implemented in modern tape drives. However, for higher recording density, thinner media is desirable. Reducing the thickness of media can significantly decrease its stiffness and increase the likelihood of damage to media edges by adjacent mechanical components on the guiding path. To avoid this, alternative tape guiding and actuation are required, and many advanced guiding mechanisms without the use of flanged guides have been developed to reduce lateral tape motion in industry and academia. The transverse force (tension) applied to the travelling tape is another key element of LTM dynamics and is controlled using the dynamics of tape pack driving sources in the modern tape drive products in using an open loop control logic. However, the developing advanced guiding and actuation technologies influence the tension irregularly and the current tension control algorithm is not able to handle the irregular changes of tension. An active tension control is required to feasibly advance LTM actuations. This thesis is motivated by the need for future engineering advances in guiding and actuation technologies for magnetic tape. Advanced guiding and actuation technologies have been developed to enable the active tension (transverse force) actuation of axially moving tape. An advanced tension actuation technology of axially moving media with dynamic tape path alternation using a novel rotary guider is considered in this thesis, and its effectiveness and technical feasibility is analysed in the context of actuating travelling tape tension. The specific issues addressed in this thesis are listed below. Development of linear magnetic tape transport system with an advanced active tension actuation. • A homemade linear magnetic tape transport system is developed. • The footsteps of development including technical design details of hardware and software are described. • A tape transport system that enables an actuation of travelling tape tension with dynamic tape path alternation using a novel rotary guider was purposely developed. • The tension is regulated actuating the amount of surface friction force between the tape and the rotary guider by altering the tape path dynamically rotating the rotary guider based on the feedback from strain gauge based tension sensor. Experimental studies of travelling tape tension shift phenomena with fixed tape path. • Parameter studies are carried to investigate the transitions of travelling tape tension during the tape transport process with the fixed angle of rotary guider (fixed tape path) in the travelling speed of tape and the angle of rotary guider. • Through experimental studies, it is found that the tension gradually increases as the tape is transported and the state of change in tension is heavily relay on the dynamics of tape pack driving source. • The angle of rotary guider shifts the level of tension. Generally, higher rotation angle of the rotary guider and the travelling speed of tape apply greater tension to the tape. Transverse force regulation with dynamic tape path alternation. • The effectiveness of tension regulation with dynamic tape path alternation using the rotary guider is investigated through experimental studies. • A closed loop control algorism of rotary guider controller is developed in order to control the operations of the rotary guider and implemented to the tape transport system. • The developed controller has a significant influence to the transition of tension. • The travelling tape tension is successfully regulated as targeted with the designed controller. It can be concluded that the rotary guider with a closed loop control algorism has an ability to actuate the travelling tape tension without relying on the dynamics of tape pack driving sources to control the tension...|$|R
