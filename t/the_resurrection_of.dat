5|$|In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's {{willingness}} to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac {{is used as}} an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigure of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.|$|E

5|$|Production of the Mellotron ceased in 1986, but it regained {{popularity}} in the 1990s, and was used by several notable bands.

5|$|The manner {{with which}} van der Weyden {{presents}} <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> the dead across the five lower panels {{is reminiscent of}} a Gothic tympanum, specifically that at Autun Cathedral.

5|$|Varaha symbolizes <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> {{the earth}} from a pralaya (dissolution of the universe) and the {{establishment}} of a new kalpa (aeon).

5|$|Church {{belief in}} <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> the body {{led to a}} {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law.

5|$|In 1999, Thornton {{introduced}} {{the character of}} Dr. Dooom on the album First Come, First Served (1999). The album featured a track in which the character murdered Dr. Octagon. In 2002, Thornton announced <b>The</b> <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Dr. Octagon, a proposed sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. The resulting album, The Return of Dr. Octagon released in 2006, was largely produced without Thornton's involvement, based upon three completed vocal tracks and reconstructed outtakes. Thornton later produced Dr. Dooom 2 in response to The Return of Dr. Octagon.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) {{and other researchers}} around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding four, not two, monophyletic groups within the albatrosses. They proposed <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> two of the old genus names, Phoebastria for the North Pacific albatrosses and Thalassarche for the mollymawks, with the great albatrosses retaining Diomedea and the sooty albatrosses staying in Phoebetria. Both the British Ornithologists' Union and the South African authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been accepted {{by the majority of}} researchers.|$|E

A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that his powers were never lost, only dormant.

5|$|The Return of Dr. Octagon is {{the tenth}} studio album by American rapper Keith Thornton, {{better known as}} Kool Keith. Released in the United States on June 27, 2006, it is his second studio album under the Dr. Octagon alias, {{following}} Dr. Octagonecologyst. The album revives the character of Dr. Octagon, who was killed off on Thornton's 1999 release First Come, First Served.

5|$|The key {{themes of}} the early Quranic verses {{included}} the responsibility of man towards his creator; <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> the dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise, and the signs of God {{in all aspects of}} life. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not killing newborn girls.|$|E

5|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the second}} of three Easter feast days included the narration of the Road to Emmaus. The cantata was Bach's first composition for Easter as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He derived it from his earlier Serenata, which had a similar celebratory mood. An unknown librettist solved the problem that Bach's congratulatory cantata was a dialogue of tenor and alto by retaining a dialogue in three movements, assigned to Hope and Fear. They represent different attitudes to the news of <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, which {{may be found in}} the two disciples, discussing the events on their walk, but also within the listener of the cantata.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} {{tensions in}} the Middle East, tensions that would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room {{had to be made}} for the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> the just {{and to the left}} is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
