25|$|The {{trial of}} the alleged conspirators began on May 9. A {{military}} tribunal, rather than a civilian court, {{was chosen as the}} prosecutorial venue because government officials thought that its more lenient rules of evidence would enable the court <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of what was then perceived by the public as a vast conspiracy. A military tribunal also avoided the possibility of jury nullification, for federal officials worried that a jury drawn from the pro-Southern populace of the District of Columbia might free the prisoners. All eight alleged conspirators were tried simultaneously. The prosecution was led by Judge Advocate General Brigadier General Joseph Holt, assisted by Assistant Judge Advocate General Colonel Henry Lawrence Burnett, and Judge Advocate Major John Bingham. A panel of nine judges (all military officers), sat in judgment over the accused. Conviction required a simple majority of judges, while imposition of the death sentence required a two-thirds majority. The only appeal was directly to the President of the United States.|$|E

500|$|The {{reconciliation}} of the father-son relationship between Edward and William {{is the key}} theme in Big Fish. Novelist Daniel Wallace's interest in {{the theme of the}} father-son relationship began with his own family. Wallace found the [...] "charming" [...] character of Edward Bloom similar to his father, who used charm to keep his distance from other people. In the film, Will believes Edward has never been honest with him because Edward creates extravagant myths about his past to hide himself, using storytelling as an avoidance mechanism. Edward's stories are filled with fairy tale characters (a witch, mermaid, giant, and werewolf) and places (the circus, small towns, the mythological city of Spectre), all of which are classic images and archetypes. The quest motif propels both Edward's story and Will's attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of it. Wallace explains: [...] "The father's quest is to be a big fish in a big pond, and the son's quest is to see through his tall tales." ...|$|E
500|$|Twentieth-century scholarship's {{focus on}} the doubt {{expressed}} by Boniface regarding {{the authenticity of the}} Libellus has led to the widely held belief that a general atmosphere of suspicion surrounded the Libellus in the Middle Ages. In fact, Boniface appears to have been the only medieval personality to have ever expressed doubt about the authorship of this letter. As missionary to the Germanic peoples of Europe and legate of the papal see, Boniface spent much of his later life in Continental Europe, where he encountered many canonical traditions that were unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxons and that appeared to Boniface out of step with his knowledge of church tradition. The Libellus represented one such tradition. Boniface in fact had very practical reasons for questioning the Libellus. He had witnessed its recommendations being exploited by certain members of the Frankish nobility who claimed that the Libellus permitted them to enter into unions with their aunts, unions Boniface considered to be incestuous. Eager <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of this controversy, in 735 Boniface wrote to Nothhelm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, requesting Nothhelm send him Canterbury's own copy of the Libellus; presumably Boniface hoped that Canterbury (being the one-time residence of Augustine) possessed an authentic copy of the Libellus, one that perhaps preserved more ancient readings than the copies then circulating in France and Bavaria, and would therefore serve as a corrective to the Continental copies and the incestuous nobles who relied upon them. Boniface also requested Nothhelm's opinion on the document's authenticity, for his own inquiries at the papal archives had failed to turn up an official [...] "registered" [...] copy of the letter there. His failed attempt to locate a [...] "registered" [...] papal copy of the Libellus presumably suggested to Boniface the possibility that the document was spurious and had in fact not been authored by Pope Gregory I.|$|E
