5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. <b>The</b> <b>sensor</b> coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|When the MERIS sensor {{aboard the}} European Space Agency's {{satellite}} Envisat observed and recorded Hurricane Elida at peak intensity, {{it was the}} first time that <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> had observed a hurricane. <b>The</b> <b>sensor</b> was originally designed primarily for recording oceanic biology and water quality as well as land vegetation, clouds, and water vapor.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide nanorod sensors are devices {{detecting}} {{changes in}} electric current passing through zinc oxide nanowires due to adsorption of gas molecules. Selectivity to hydrogen gas {{was achieved by}} sputtering Pd clusters on the nanorod surface. The addition of Pd appears {{to be effective in}} the catalytic dissociation of hydrogen molecules into atomic hydrogen, increasing the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> device. <b>The</b> <b>sensor</b> detects hydrogen concentrations down to 10 parts per million at room temperature, whereas there is no response to oxygen.|$|E

If all <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> have <b>the</b> same shared key, {{any one of}} <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> can directly send data to other <b>sensors.</b> Then, <b>the</b> collaboration between {{the members of the}} team will be easier by having an efficient dialog between <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> that represents <b>the</b> firefighter.|$|R
30|$|The {{observations}} of <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> contained in <b>the</b> circle and the square are highly correlated among {{their peers in}} the same group; whereas <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> in <b>the</b> circle are weakly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> in <b>the</b> square.|$|R

5|$|In {{two-dimensional}} articulography, transmitter coils {{are placed}} in an equilateral triangle along the midsagittal plane at the forehead, chin, and neck. Because of the geometric orientation of the transmitter coils, accurate readings are able to be taken as long as <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> coils placed on the tongue stay within about a centimeter of the midsagittal plane and are not angled at more than 30 degrees.|$|E
5|$|The MSS was {{manufactured}} by Hughes Aircraft Company. <b>The</b> <b>sensor</b> {{was considered an}} experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists reviewed the data that was beamed back to Earth. After the data was reviewed, the MSS was considered the primary sensor. The MSS was a four-channel scanner that obtained radiometric images of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sensor</b> Bar is {{required}} when the Wii Remote is controlling up-down, left-right motion of a cursor or reticle on the TV screen {{to point to}} menu options or objects such as enemies in first-person shooters. Because <b>the</b> <b>Sensor</b> Bar also allows the Wii Remote to calculate {{the distance between the}} Wii Remote and <b>the</b> <b>Sensor</b> Bar, the Wii Remote can also control slow forward-backward motion of an object in a 3-dimensional game. Rapid forward-backward motion, such as punching in a boxing game, is controlled by the acceleration sensors. Using these acceleration sensors (acting as tilt sensors), the Wii Remote can also control rotation of a cursor or other objects.|$|E

30|$|To {{reliably}} discriminate regional tectonic strain {{signals from}} local noise near <b>the</b> <b>sensors,</b> I selected only coherent anomalies that were consistent among all four horizontal components at each station. <b>The</b> <b>sensors</b> of these components are installed at intervals of 45 ° azimuth and about 25  cm vertical position, so that {{four sets of}} principal strains can be calculated from different combinations of three of <b>the</b> four <b>sensors.</b> Because an elastic strain field features strong geometric spreading that is inversely proportional to the cube of distance, variation among <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> is negligible for a sufficiently distant tectonic strain source, but a nearby source imposes notable variation among <b>the</b> <b>sensors.</b> Thus, a strain anomaly of tectonic origin that is uniform around <b>the</b> <b>sensors</b> should result in four identical sets of calculated principal strains.|$|R
25|$|Speed sensors: A {{speed sensor}} {{is used to}} {{determine}} the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a Hall effect sensor, or a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b> The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b> Since the voltage induced in <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is a result of the}} rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.|$|E

25|$|Vibrating viscometers {{can also}} be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or {{vibrational}} viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured, and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.|$|E

In order {{to overcome the}} inherent limitation of <b>the</b> acoustic <b>sensor</b> for <b>the</b> simultaneous multiple object tracking, support from <b>the</b> visual <b>sensor</b> is considered. Cooperation from <b>the</b> visual <b>sensor,</b> however, {{is better to be}} minimized, as <b>the</b> visual <b>sensor's</b> operation requires much higher computational resources than the acoustic sensor-based estimation, especially when <b>the</b> visual <b>sensor</b> is not dedicated to object tracking and deployed for other applications. <b>The</b> acoustic <b>sensor</b> mainly tracks multiple objects, and <b>the</b> visual <b>sensor</b> supports <b>the</b> tracking task only when <b>the</b> acoustic <b>sensor</b> has a difficulty. Several techniques based on particle filtering are used for multiple object tracking by <b>the</b> acoustic <b>sensor,</b> and <b>the</b> limitations of <b>the</b> acoustic <b>sensor</b> are discussed to identify the need for <b>the</b> visual <b>sensor</b> cooperation.
