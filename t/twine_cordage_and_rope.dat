5000|$|Environmentalists cry foul {{over this}} provision, stating that various laws {{are bound to}} be {{violated}} if the agreement pushes through. Under the Constitution alone, it is imperative that the State promotes the people's right to health (Article II, Section 15), and right to a balanced and healthful ecology (Article II, Section 16). Other laws that may be violated include Republic Act No. 6969 (Toxic Substance and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Act of 1990) which prohibits the entry of hazardous wastes into and their disposal within the country for whatever purpose, and Republic Act No. 4653 (An Act to Safeguard the Health of the People and Maintain the Dignity of the Nation by Declaring it a National Policy to Prohibit the Commercial Importation of Textile Articles Commonly Known as Used Clothing and Rags) wherein worn clothing and other worn articles, used or new rags, scrap <b>twine,</b> <b>cordage,</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> cables and worn out articles of <b>twine,</b> <b>cordage,</b> rope or cables, of textile materials are also prohibited from being imported into the Philippines. Aside from local laws, one international treaty is also said to be a direct contradiction to the JPEPA. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was ratified in 1989 by 133 countries and is currently adopted by 170 countries, including Japan and the Philippines. It is the most comprehensive global environmental treaty on hazardous and other wastes, addressing cleaner production, hazardous waste minimization and controls on the movement of these wastes. One of the main concerns regarding JPEPA is the possibility of having Japan export their waste products and hazardous materials to the Philippines. Such products are included in Article 29 of the agreement, which defines [...] "originating goods. Under Article 18 of the agreement, both Japan and the Philippines shall either [...] "reduce or eliminate its customs duties eliminate other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with the importation and take part in [...] "improving market access conditions for originating goods.|$|R

5000|$|The other {{essential}} {{product of the}} Maldives was coir, the fibre of the dried coconut husk. Cured in pits, beaten, spun and then twisted into <b>cordage</b> <b>and</b> <b>ropes,</b> coir's salient quality is its resistance to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the dhows that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, China, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf. [...] "It is stronger than hemp", wrote Ibn Battuta, [...] "and is used to sew together the planks of Sindhi and Yemeni dhows, for this sea abounds in reefs, and if the planks were fastened with iron nails, they would break into pieces when the vessel hit a rock. The coir gives the boat greater elasticity, so that it doesn't break up." ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Nowadays, {{pineapple}} {{leaf fibre}} (PALF) {{is getting more}} attention in research area since it’s showed the enhanced properties to be utilized in few industries. From the previous studies, it has been proved that, PALF is mechanically sound as a composites reinforcement agent and it’s showed the good contribution in pulp and papermaking production. Due to its enhanced properties, PALF now is commercialized as an alternative textile fiber. PALF is silky, fine and textile grade. Apart from being used as an alternative fiber for home textile and apparel, PALF meet the basic requirement {{to be used as}} technical fibers. Instead of having a good strength, PALF also have a reasonable length as well as can be pliable. All of these are the main principle of rope making fibers hence make PALF have huge potential to be used as rope making fibers. This paper will present the possibility of converting PALF into textile yarns <b>and</b> then into <b>rope</b> yarns for <b>cordage</b> <b>and</b> <b>rope</b> making. The methodology involved is included PALF extraction, PALF spinning, and PALF twisting. Finally, this paper will present the expected approached for the upcoming work area...|$|R

In the days of sail ship chandlers on remote islands, such as St. Helena, were responsible for delivering re-supplies of water and fresh produce (fruit and vegetables) to stave off scurvy. [...] The ship chandlery business was central to the existence and the social and political dynamics of ports and their waterfront areas.|$|R

The making of <b>cordage</b> (<b>rope</b> <b>and</b> string) was done entirely by hand, with no tools. Asclepias was also used by the Native American Yokut or Mariposa in northern and central California for string or rope.|$|R
