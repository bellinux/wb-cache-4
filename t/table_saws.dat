25|$|Mini and micro <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are {{generally}} used by hobbyists and model builders, although the mini <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> (4 inch) have gained some popularity with building contractors that only need a small saw to cut small pieces (such as wood trim).

25|$|Benchtop <b>table</b> <b>saws,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} job-site saws, are lightweight and {{are designed to}} be placed on a table or other support for operation. They commonly have direct drive (no v-belt or pulleys) from a universal motor. They can be lifted by one person and carried to the job location.

25|$|Hybrid <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor <b>table</b> <b>saws.</b> They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|E
25|$|In {{a modern}} table saw, {{the depth of}} the cut is varied by moving the blade up and down: the higher the blade {{protrudes}} above the table, the deeper the cut that is made in the material. In some early <b>table</b> <b>saws,</b> the blade and arbor were fixed, and the table was moved up and down to expose more or less of the blade. The angle of cut is controlled by adjusting the angle of blade. Some earlier saws angled the table to control the cut angle.|$|E

25|$|Inserts: <b>Table</b> <b>saws</b> have a {{changeable}} insert in {{the table}} through which the blade projects. Purchasable inserts are usually made out of metal. Zero-Clearance inserts can be made of a sawable material such as plastic or wood. When a Zero-Clearance insert is initially inserted, the blade is raised through the insert creating the slot. This creates a slot with no gaps around the blade. The zero clearance insert helps prevent tearout by providing support for wood fibers {{right next to the}} blade thus helping to make a very clean cut. Other inserts can be bought or created in the same manner, such as a dado insert.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are {{the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
2500|$|... : <b>Table</b> <b>saws</b> {{commonly}} have a fence (guide) {{running from}} the front of the table (the side nearest the operator) to the back, parallel to the cutting plane of the blade. The distance of the fence from the blade can be adjusted, which determines where on the workpiece the cut is made. The fence is commonly called a [...] "rip fence" [...] referring to its use in guiding the workpiece during the process of making a rip cut. Most <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> come standard with a rip fence, but some high end saws are available without a fence so a fence of the user's choice can be purchased separately.|$|E

2500|$|Contractor <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are heavier, {{larger and}} have an {{attached}} stand or base, often with wheels. The motor either is [...] "direct drive" [...] to the blade (drives the blade directly without a belt) or hinges off {{the rear of the}} saw and drives the blade via one, or occasionally two, belts using a 1 to 2 hp (750 to 1500 W) induction type motor. This is the type often used by hobbyists and homeowners because standard electrical circuits provide adequate power to run it, and due to its low cost. Because the motor sometimes hangs off the rear of the saw on a pivot, dust collection can be problematic in comparison with a cabinet saw.|$|E
2500|$|Cabinet <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> {{are heavy}} (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (cabinet). Cabinet saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated branch circuit). The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be ganged without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used). Cabinet saws are heavier and offer the following advantages over contractor saws: heavier construction for lower vibration and increased durability; a cabinet-mounted trunnion (the mechanism that incorporates the saw blade mount and allows for height and tilt adjustment); improved dust collection due to the totally enclosed cabinet and common incorporation of a dust collection port. Cabinet saws are designed for, and are capable of very high duty-cycles, such as are encountered in commercial/industrial applications. Where some {{of the advantages of}} a cabinet saw are desired in a home shop application, so-called [...] "hybrid" [...] saws have emerged to address this need.|$|E

2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are not equipped to allow the use of a stacked dado blade set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer jointer, planer, shaper or boring features. The blade arbor typically has a diameter of 30mm, though for the American market a [...] " [...] arbor is commonly available as an option. Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a stacked dado blade to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a shaper or other tool for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a riving knife to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular saw blade. The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|E
