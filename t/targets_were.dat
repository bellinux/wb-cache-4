5|$|Targeting bore little {{resemblance}} to reality in that the sequence of attacks was uncoordinated and the <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> approved randomly – even illogically. The North's airfields, which, according to any rational targeting policy, should have been hit first in the campaign, were also off-limits.|$|E
5|$|Enemy naval <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> {{not subject}} to the prize regulations, so on 23 September, Wenninger torpedoed and sank the , a trawler of the French Navy off the Dyck lightship. There was only one {{survivor}} from the 303-ton ship's eighteen-man crew. Three months later, Wenninger misidentified the 74-ton French fishing ship Jesus Maria as a destroyer. UB-17 launched a torpedo which struck the ship and killed all six men of Jesus Marias crew.|$|E
5|$|In September the <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> in the Visayas and the {{southern}} Philippines, then Manila and Cavite, Panay, Negros, Leyte, and Cebu. Early in October raids to destroy enemy air power based on Okinawa and Formosa were begun {{in preparation for the}} Leyte landings of 20 October 1944.|$|E

5|$|On 25 June 1943, another B-17 {{formation}} {{headed into}} Germany. However, both {{primary and secondary}} <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> covered with cloud and the bombers attacked two convoys off the Frisian Islands. Some eight assorted groups of fighters intercepted, among them III./JG 1, who claimed seven bombers, Leesmann responsible for one of them. III./JG 1 lost two pilots including Adjutant Oberleutnant Friedrich Hardt, and three pilots were injured.|$|E
5|$|After a lull, anti-shipping {{operations}} {{attacks were}} resumed by some Ju 87 units from 1 November 1940, {{as part of}} the new winter tactic of enforcing a blockade. Over the next 10 days, seven merchant ships were sunk or damaged, mainly in the Thames Estuary, for the loss of four Ju 87s. On 14 November 19 Stukas from III./St.G 1 with escort drawn from JG 26 and JG 51 went out against another convoy; as no <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> found over the estuary, the Stukas proceeded to attack Dover, their alternate target.|$|E
5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked. While Kommandøren was docked at Leikanger, {{the village was}} attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While {{on the way to}} hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.|$|E

5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> clearly identified.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preparation}} for D-Day {{in the spring}} of 1944, the Allies launched the Transport Plan, carrying out intensive bombing of railway junctions and transport networks across northern France and Belgium. Many of these <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> in towns near densely populated civilian areas, such as La Louvière and Kortrijk in Belgium, which were bombed in March 1944. The phase of bombing in the lead up to D-Day alone resulted in 1,500 civilian casualties. Bombing of targets in Belgium steadily increased as the Allies advanced westward across France. Allied bombing during the liberation in September 1944 killed 9,750 Belgians and injured 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Early, who had {{threatened}} the federal capital of Washington, D.C. {{during the first}} half of July, followed his Kernstown victory with an attack on northern territory. He dispatched two brigades of cavalry under General John McCausland and General Bradley Johnson to conduct raids in Pennsylvania. McCausland was the force's commander and led the first brigade, while Johnson commanded the second brigade. Their purpose was to burn northern towns unless they received a ransom. Their first two <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and Cumberland, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|France also {{committed}} military {{assets to}} the coalition; in October 1990, eight Jaguar A aircraft {{along with several}} Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft {{were sent to the}} Middle East, with the Mirages, which had more advanced avionics, acting as guides for the Jaguars. Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers, RAF Tornadoes also required adaption to a lesser extent. The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia built up to a maximum of 28 aircraft, which carried out 615 combat sorties, with one Jaguar damaged by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile. Typical <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> Iraqi armoured units, Scud missile sites, and naval vessels.|$|E

5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the research vessel Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again very poor, but all 14 of the <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object that looked like a propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the LPO {{was caught}} up in a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, the Polish {{newspaper}} Dziennik {{revealed that}} a target with a photo of Litvinenko on it was used for shooting practice by the Vityaz Training Centre in Balashikha in October 2002. The centre was not affiliated {{with the government and}} trained bodyguards, debt collectors and private security forces, although in November 2006 the centre was used by the Vityaz for a qualification examination due to their own centre being under renovation.

5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' dictates.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April the Joint Chiefs persuaded McNamara and Johnson {{to launch}} a four-week attack on North Vietnam's lines of communications, which would isolate that nation from its {{overland}} sources of supply in the PRC and the Soviet Union. About one-third of the North's imports came down the northeast railroad from the PRC, while the remaining two-thirds came by sea through Haiphong and other ports. For {{the first time in}} the campaign, <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> to be chosen for their military, rather than their psychological, significance. During the four weeks, 26 bridges and seven ferries were destroyed. Other targets included the extensive North Vietnamese radar system, barracks, and ammunition depots.|$|E
