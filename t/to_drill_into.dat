5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall County {{officials}} {{brought the}} extension of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have easier access <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>into</b> the area, likely by fracking. Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be built, it would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $5 million per mile. It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E

25|$|For {{much of the}} United States' history, {{fossil fuels}} {{have been a major}} energy source. While phasing out these fossil fuels will benefit the world climate in the long run, little has been done to stop burning fossil fuels and {{emitting}} CO2 into the atmosphere. If the United States effectively phases out fossil fuels, tons of energy in the form of oil, coal, and natural gas will be left untouched under the surface of the ground. Although this energy source is limited, companies and workers continue <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>into</b> the Earth to extract it all.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, Canada was {{importing}} 90% of its {{oil from}} the U.S. The situation changed dramatically in 1947 when, after drilling 133 consecutive dry holes, Imperial Oil decided <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>into</b> a peculiar anomaly on its newly developed seismic recordings near the then-village of Leduc {{to see what it}} was. The Leduc No. 1 well identified a large oil field, and provided the geological key for other important discoveries within Alberta. Geologists soon began to identify and drill other Devonian reefs within the province - mostly in the north-central portion of the province. The Alberta oil rush began, and drillers quickly began to identify other important oil-bearing formations like the one hosting the giant Pembina oilfield.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Munk and Harry Hess {{suggested}} {{the idea behind}} Project Mohole: [...] <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>into</b> the Mohorovicic Discontinuity and obtain {{a sample of the}} Earth's mantle. [...] While such a project was not feasible on land, drilling in the open ocean would be more feasible, because the mantle is much closer to the sea floor. [...] Initially led by the informal group of scientists known as the American Miscellaneous Society (AMSOC, including Hess, Maurice Ewing, and Roger Revelle), the project was eventually taken over by the National Science Foundation (NSF). [...] Initial test drillings into the sea floor led by Willard Bascom occurred off Guadalupe Island, Mexico in March and April 1961. [...] The project became mismanaged and increasingly expensive after Brown and Root won the contract to continue the effort, however, and Congress discontinued the project toward the end of 1966. [...] While Project Mohole was not successful, the idea led to projects such as NSF's Deep Sea Drilling Program.|$|E

60|$|One of {{the great}} discoveries of this admirable Inquiry is the fascination of the davits. All these people {{positively}} can't get away from them. They shuffle about and groan around their davits. Whereas the obvious {{thing to do is}} to eliminate the man-handled davits altogether. Don't you think that with all the mechanical contrivances, with all the generated power on board these ships, it is about time to get rid of the hundred- years-old, man-power appliances? Cranes are what is wanted; low, compact cranes with adjustable heads, one to each set of six or nine boats. And if people tell you of insuperable difficulties, if they tell you of the swing and spin of spanned boats, don't you believe them. The heads of the cranes need not be any higher than the heads of the davits. The lift required would be only a couple of inches. As to the spin, there is a way to prevent that if you have in each boat two men who know what they are about. I have taken up on board a heavy ship's boat, in the open sea (the ship rolling heavily), with a common cargo derrick. And a cargo derrick is very much like a crane; but a crane devised ad hoc would be infinitely easier to work. We must remember that the loss of this ship has altered the moral atmosphere. As long as the Titanic is remembered, an ugly rush for the boats may be feared in case of some accident. You can't hope <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>into</b> perfect discipline a casual mob of six hundred firemen and waiters, but in a ship like the Titanic you can keep on a permanent trustworthy crew of one hundred intelligent seamen and mechanics who would know their stations for abandoning ship and would do the work efficiently. The boats could be lowered with sufficient dispatch. One does not want to let rip one's boats by the run all at the same time. With six boat-cranes, six boats would be simultaneously swung, filled, and got away from the side; and if any sort of order is kept, the ship could be cleared of the passengers in a quite short time. For there must be boats enough for the passengers and crew, whether you increase the number of boats or limit the number of passengers, irrespective of the size of the ship. That is the only honest course. Any other would be rather worse than putting sand in the sugar, for which a tradesman gets fined or imprisoned. Do not let us take a romantic view of the so-called progress. A company selling passages is a tradesman; though from the way these people talk and behave you would think they are benefactors of mankind in some mysterious way, engaged in some lofty and amazing enterprise.|$|E
