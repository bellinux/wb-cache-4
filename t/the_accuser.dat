5|$|But now, I {{no longer}} pleaded for anything. I {{was no longer}} able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was <b>the</b> <b>accuser,</b> God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} and was acquitted two years later. During the investigation, Jackson's profile was {{examined}} by Stan Katz, a mental health professional, who spent several hours with <b>the</b> <b>accuser</b> as well. According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old. Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that Jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.|$|E

5000|$|Sandusky's defense {{attorneys}} argued that <b>the</b> <b>accusers</b> were driven by financial motives. The defense {{also pointed out}} some of <b>the</b> <b>accusers</b> had changed their stories {{and that some of}} them continued a relationship with Sandusky after the alleged abuse (one went to a football game with Sandusky shortly before his arrest, another brought his girlfriend to meet Sandusky). A psychiatrist testifying for the defense, Dr. Eliot Atkins, diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder, a disorder characterized by attention seeking behavior and exaggerated emotions. Dr. Atkins testified that the letters written by Sandusky to <b>the</b> <b>accusers</b> were consistent with this disorder, rather than [...] "grooming" [...] behavior as alleged by the prosecution.|$|R
5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine <b>the</b> <b>accuser.</b> These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|A {{report that}} King Charles was very sick sent the Yorks back to England post-haste. They feared the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and {{commander}} of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence. The matter {{was compounded by}} the fact that Monmouth enjoyed the support of the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where they stayed on-and-off for the next three years. Lodging in Holyrood Palace, the Yorks had to make do without Ladies Anne and Isabella, who stayed in London on Charles's orders. The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland. Separated from Lady Isabella once again, Mary sank into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons. Lady Isabella, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died in February 1681. Isabella's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabella's death, Mary's mother was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King. <b>The</b> <b>accuser,</b> a pamphleteer, was executed by order of the King.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{defection}} of {{some former}} supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to rally outside the courthouse, arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular {{attacks on the}} integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at {{a close friend of}} <b>the</b> <b>accuser,</b> and even stones thrown at a woman that members of the crowd mistook for <b>the</b> <b>accuser.</b> Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a state of shock, and that {{the relationship between the two}} was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E

25|$|After someone {{concluded}} that a loss, illness or death had been caused by witchcraft, <b>the</b> <b>accuser</b> entered a complaint against the alleged witch with the local magistrates.

25|$|Formal {{accusation}} was {{the second}} element of the trial of Socrates, which <b>the</b> <b>accuser,</b> Meletus, swore to be true, before the archon (a state officer with mostly religious duties) who considered the evidence and determined {{that there was an}} actionable case of “moral corruption of Athenian youth” and “impiety”, for which the philosopher must legally answer; the archon summoned Socrates for a trial by jury.|$|E
25|$|I am {{now before}} {{you in a}} public character.

25|$|Traditionally, the Tanala {{adhered to}} trial by ordeal to {{determine}} the guilt or innocence of an accused party.

If found innocent, <b>the</b> <b>accuser</b> was forced to pay a fine of four zebu, of which two were given to the accused and the two others went to the king and his advisor.|$|E
25|$|In {{mainstream}} Christianity, the Devil (or Satan) is {{a fallen}} angel who rebelled against God. Satan {{was expelled from}} Heaven and sent to Earth. The devil is often identified as the serpent in the Garden of Eden, whose persuasions led to the two corresponding Christian doctrines: the Original Sin and its cure, the Redemption of Jesus Christ. He is also identified as <b>the</b> <b>accuser</b> of Job, the tempter of the Gospels, Leviathan and the dragon in the Book of Revelation.|$|E
25|$|The Guardians of the Galaxy Playset, {{which is}} heavily {{inspired}} by the Guardians of the Galaxy film in terms of design, centers on the Guardians stealing an Infinity Stone from Ronan <b>the</b> <b>Accuser.</b> Ronan follows the Guardians to the planet Knowhere.

25|$|Early Medieval courts {{generally}} {{followed a}} process called accusatio, largely based on Germanic practices. In this procedure, an individual would make an accusation against someone to the court. However, if the suspect was judged innocent, <b>the</b> <b>accusers</b> faced legal penalties for bringing false charges. This provided a disincentive to make any accusation unless <b>the</b> <b>accusers</b> were sure it would stand. Later, a threshold requirement was {{the establishment of the}} accused's publica fama, i.e., the fact that the person was widely believed to be guilty of the offense charged.|$|R
5000|$|To prevent <b>the</b> Hungarian <b>accuser's</b> {{office from}} {{neglecting}} its duties, natural human private persons can submit investigation requests, called [...] "pótmagánvád" [...] {{directly to the}} courts, if the accusers' office refuses to do its job. Courts will decide if the allegations have merit and order police to act in lieu of <b>the</b> <b>accuser's</b> office if warranted. In its decision No. 42/2005 the Hungarian constitutional court declared that {{the government does not}} enjoy such privilege and the state is powerless to further pursue cases if <b>the</b> public <b>accuser</b> refuses to do so.|$|R
