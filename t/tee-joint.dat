40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} static {{pull and push}} bending tests on {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) orthogonal EW 220 / 5284 twill weave fabric (TWF) composite tee-joints processed with the resin transfer moulding (RTM) technique. Static pull and push bending properties are determined and failure initiation mechanism is deduced from experimental observations. The experiments show that the failure initiation load, on average, is greater for push bending than for pull bending, whereas the scatter is smaller for push bending than for pull bending. The failure mode of RTM-made tee-joints in pull bending tests can be reckoned to be characteristic of debonding of resin matrix at the interface between the triangular resin-rich zone and the curved web of <b>tee-joint</b> until complete separation of the curved web from the bottom plate. In contrast, as distinct from the products subject to pull bending loading, the RTM tee-joints in push bending tests experience matrix cracking and fibre fracture from outer layers to inner layers of the bottom plate until catastrophic collapse resulting from the bending. Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models are presented to simulate the load transfer path and failure initiation mechanism of RTM-made TWF composite <b>tee-joint</b> based on the maximum stress criterion. Good correlation between experimental and numerical results is achieved...|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the {{curvilinear}} tubes and the <b>tee-joints,</b> {{which are the}} critical members of tubing systems. The purpose is to study the stressed-strained state of thinwalled members of tubing in the geometrically-non-linear statement. The design algorithms of stressed-strained state of shells in large elastic displacements have been developed by the method of finite members. The non-linear stressed-strained state of curvilinear tubes of different shapes of cross-sections and <b>tee-joints</b> in the action of bending moments and internal pressure has been studied for the first time. The design results of curvilinear tubes {{have been used in}} development of Industrial StandardAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{study of}} {{influence}} of preheating and MMA welding technique of <b>tee-joints</b> of plate girders to insert plates of a composite steel-concrete {{structure of the}} telecommunication tower, on the properties {{and quality of the}} concrete in the region of the insert plate has been carried out. Design/methodology/approach: Studies of thermo-mechanical phenomena during manual arc welding MMA of <b>tee-joints</b> between plate girders and insert plates were carried out to identify possible sources of the concrete damage due to high welding temperature and stresses. Findings: It was shown that MMA welding at vertical-up position, by a rutile coated electrode of diameter 3, 2 [mm], at welding current 110 - 120 [A], of the butt welds of <b>tee-joints</b> of girders and the insert plate does not cause any harmful and damaging effect to concrete, which temperature in a region of the contact with the bottom surface of the insert plate does not exceed 240 [Â°C] during full cycle of welding. Tensile and compression stresses of concrete are transmitted mainly by anchoring bars, fixed in concrete and also by reinforcing fabric of concrete, and do not cause any cracks of concrete. Research limitations/implications: To achieve more consistent results of the numerical analysis of stresses and deformation distribution in the insert plate with experimental results, it is necessary to calculate plastic deformation of materials and also take into consideration nonlinear change of yield point (plasticity) as a function of temperature. Practical implications: The technology was applied for welding of the girders to insert plates of the telecommunication tower in Kuwait. Originality/value: Welding procedure specification ensuring high quality of the welded joints of girders and insert plate of composite steel-concrete structure...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} is a lightweight, universal connector that joins stringers {{at various}} angles. The connectors 10 are fabricated from fiber-epoxy resin strips that wrap around stringers 30 and have ends, tabs 16 and 18, which extend in one general direction. The inside {{surface of the}} first tab 16 lies on a plane defined by the stringers being joined, and the second tab 18 is separated from the first tab 16 by a distance equal to their thickness. Stringers 30 of different shapes and sizes are joined by alternately bonding the first tab 16 of one connector between the first 16 and second 18 tabs of another connector. <b>Tee-joints</b> are formed by using web elements 41 and 42 which each partially wrap around a stringer 3010 and have tabs 411 and 421 which are offset, and are bonded between tabs 16 and 18 of universal connectors 109 and 1010 bonded to another stringer 309. Sharp corners are trimmed from the tabs so that a gusset area remains between the stringers for support. Acute angle through obtuse angle joints are formed by trimming those edges of the tabs which lie against the stringers. A specific application of the invention is a Walker 60, utilized by handicapped individuals, fabricated from composite materials that is 40 % lighter than similar metallic structures...|$|R
40|$|The use of robots {{for welding}} is {{beneficial}} {{as they can}} allow more rapid welding of parts and to also eliminate the harm exposed to workers arising from hazardous working conditions. These robots however are generally operated by using fixed sequences of commands that offer no flexibility {{to changes in the}} welding task. A review into the existing approaches to remedy this has provided an insight into the use of different sensor technology used to allow a welding robot to become more adaptable to variations in the tasks given to welding robots. The study identified the use of three dimensional (3 D) scanners with 3 D feature detection algorithms as a novel approach to allow identification of weld seams of simple parts without requiring any information about the weld surface geometry beforehand. Research made into various 3 D scanning technology showed laser scanning as most suitable for this task due to its previously demonstrated ability to produce scans with high accuracy and resolution by other researchers. A prototype laser scanner developed from low cost parts confirmed the feasibility of scanning metal parts with high accuracy provided the surface was not overly reflective. 3 D crease detection algorithms then applied to scanned models as well as computer generated models showed successful extraction of <b>tee-joints</b> from point cloud data. The crease detection was also shown to be reliable under random noise of up to 1 mm applied in the x, y and z direction. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using 3 D scanners to obtain weld seam locations allowing welding robots to weld objects of unknown geometry or where existing weld seam data is prone to deviations...|$|R
