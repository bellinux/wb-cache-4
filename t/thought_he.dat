5|$|A {{breakdown}} {{caused by}} a drug overdose in 1963 left Waldron unable to play or remember any music; he regained his skills gradually, while redeveloping his speed of <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> left the U.S. permanently in the mid-1960s, settled in Europe, and continued touring internationally until his death.|$|E
5|$|Fischer had {{not played}} {{competitive}} chess for eighteen months, and many <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would never return. Then, to general surprise and delight, {{he agreed to}} participate in the Soviet Union vs. the Rest of the World in 1970 in Belgrade.|$|E

Then he chuckled. He chuckled right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so he chuckled again. He cocked his head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then he cocked his head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|R
5|$|In the 2010 NBA Development League Draft, held on November 1, Rolle {{was chosen}} {{with the third}} overall pick by the Maine Red Claws. The Red Claws were the {{affiliated}} team of the Boston Celtics and the Charlotte Bobcats. According to Red Claws general manager Jon Jennings, several D-League teams <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had the most upside of anyone on the draft.|$|E
5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|After {{being hurt}} {{in a fall}} in his bathtub after {{slipping}} on a bar of soap, Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would use to announce his withdrawal. However, Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced {{each other in the}} Republican primary on June 2, 1992.|$|E

5|$|After failing his {{examinations}} Serevi {{quit school}} {{and continued to}} play for his local club Rewa. Although he trained with the team, he was omitted from playing as the coach, Jo Rauto, <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was too small and would get hurt. He was eventually selected {{to play for the}} senior provincial side when he was 17. Several months later he was asked to join the Nabua Rugby Club – under the guidance of coach Ratu Kitione Tuibua – by his uncle Vesito Rauluni. Serevi's Nabua team were highly successful in Fiji's sevens tournaments.|$|E
5|$|After he {{was passed}} over by Johnny Behan for the {{position}} of undersheriff, Wyatt <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff's office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, but the plan was foiled when the three suspects—Leonard, Head and Crane—were killed in unrelated incidents.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy. In the summer of 1639, he left home and moved about 18 miles along the coast to the village of Much Hoole, where it is <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> took up a post as a tutor for the children of the Stones family, who were prosperous haberdashers living at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} {{had intended to}} put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would be shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E
5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E

60|$|He {{walked on}} very thoughtful, {{and the more}} <b>'e</b> <b>thought,</b> the less <b>'e</b> liked it. He was so pale that Ginger <b>thought</b> <b>'e</b> was ill and advised 'im to 'ave a drop o' brandy. Peter {{recommended}} rum, so to please 'em he 'ad both. It brought 'is colour back, but not 'is cheerfulness.|$|R
5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph, and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would be moved either to the Exchequer or be asked to serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of}} his life, but the general election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's first {{fight of}} 2004, was a fourth-round {{knockout}} {{victory over the}} former world title contender Victoriano Sosa. This was after an eventful week prior to the fight, which included Cotto having to wait four hours for his luggage to arrive (after a 2 a.m. local time arrival) at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, and almost being removed from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the fight was held, by a security guard who <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was an unaccompanied minor.|$|E
5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would have great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople {{in the summer of}} 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E
5|$|Earp and Behan both {{applied to}} fill the new {{position}} of Cochise County sheriff, which like the Pima County sheriff job, paid the office holder 10% of the fees and taxes collected. Earp <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had {{a good chance to}} win the position because he was the former undersheriff in the region and a Republican, like Arizona Territorial Governor John C. Fremont. However, Behan had greater political experience and influence in Prescott.|$|E
