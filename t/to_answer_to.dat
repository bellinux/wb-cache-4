5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} that he was <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November, {{some of the}} French ships {{traveled}} to Tangier, where they picked up Consul Julius Doazan and his secretary, Fleurat, on Narval. Later that evening, Caton reached Salé and offered safe passage to Rabat for the British consul Elton and his family, {{in anticipation of the}} bombardment of the city. The following day, at 11:00a.m., Caton anchored between the cities of Rabat and Salé. Its commander demanded an apology over the thefts and raids and immediate repayment for the stolen goods, under threat of bombardment. The rais in the ports of both cities promised <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the French demands within three hours. Two hours later, all of the French ships had reached the mouth of the Bou Regreg, between Rabat and Salé.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, Davy Crockett {{appeared}} with thirtyTennesseans. Neill went on furlough on February 11 {{to visit his}} sick family, leaving Travis, {{a member of the}} regular army, in command. Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a lieutenant colonel. He refused <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> Travis, who called an election for the men to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis. Bowie celebrated his appointment by getting very drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. Travis was disgusted, but twodays later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry.|$|E

5|$|In 1170, Gervase was {{involved}} with attempts to keep Thomas Becket, {{who had been in}} exile, from returning to England. Working with Gervase were Roger de Pont L'Évêque the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury, Reginald de Warenne the Sheriff of Sussex, and Ranulf de Broc. Gervase was part of the party that met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The lay members of the group, led by Gervase, complained that the archbishop was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the three ecclesiastics who were with the group, but Becket managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the ecclesiastics who had been excommunicated by Becket. Nothing further was accomplished by this meeting except further offers from Becket to consider other options. Afterwards, Gervase and Ranulf de Broc tried to discover which of the citizens of London had welcomed Becket back into the kingdom, but were frustrated by refusal of the London clergy to appear and by the laymen refusing <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> anything but royal writs.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but would still have <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, {{although there is no}} evidence that Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and Randy Orton {{continued}} their feud over the WWE Championship, {{as the two}} were scheduled {{to compete in a}} Last Man Standing match for the title. The match, however, never occurred. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Cena defeated Mr. Kennedy in a non-title match. After the match, Orton attacked Cena and then counted to ten, which Cena was unable <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to.</b> Cena was legitimately injured in the match, and as a result, the following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Mr. McMahon vacated the WWE Championship because Cena's right pectoral tendon was legitimately torn while executing a hip toss during his match with Kennedy. At No Mercy, Mr. McMahon entered the ring and said that a new WWE Champion was to be crowned, and Orton was crowned as champion, but he was challenged by Triple H for the title on the spot. Triple H, however, defeated Orton to win the WWE Championship, but later that same night, Triple H lost the title to Orton back in a Last Man Standing match after a title defense against Umaga, who he was booked to face in a standard wrestling match.|$|E

25|$|Section 94 of the Act modifies the Solicitors Act 1974 {{to allow}} Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunals to strike {{solicitor}}s from the roll, require a solicitor or former solicitor to answer allegations, terminate a suspension from practice authorised by a Tribunal {{and restore the}} name of a struck off solicitor to the roll. The power to force a former solicitor <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> allegations is considered the most important one, because it prevents solicitors escaping punishment by ceasing to act as a solicitor. Section 95 of the Act allows for appeals to the Law Society's refusal to put a solicitor who was previously struck off back on the roll, with this appeal going to the Master of the Rolls.|$|E
