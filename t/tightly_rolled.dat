25|$|To remain {{fresh and}} prevent mold, tea {{needs to be}} stored away from heat, light, air, and moisture. Tea must be kept at room {{temperature}} in an air-tight container. Black tea in a bag within a sealed opaque canister may keep for two years. Green tea deteriorates more rapidly, usually {{in less than a}} year. <b>Tightly</b> <b>rolled</b> gunpowder tea leaves keep longer than the more open-leafed Chun Mee tea.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the most}} {{primitive}} form of smoking requires tools {{of some sort}} to perform. This {{has resulted in a}} staggering variety of smoking tools and paraphernalia from all over the world. Whether tobacco, cannabis, opium or herbs, some form of receptacle is required along with a source of fire to light the mixture. The most common today is by far the cigarette, consisting of a mild inhalant strain of tobacco in a <b>tightly</b> <b>rolled</b> tube of paper, usually manufactured industrially and including a filter, or hand-rolled with loose tobacco. Other popular smoking tools are various pipes and cigars.|$|E

40|$|Low-dimensional misfit layered {{compounds}} {{have been}} found to have ultralow thermal conductivity, which is attributed to their unique structure and the low dimensionality. There are a few studies reporting the preparation of sulfide-based misfit nanotubes but only one study on oxide-based analogs. In this investigation, we report a new oxide-based misfit nanotube derived from misfit layered strontium cobaltite. Thorough structural investigation by electron microscopy techniques, including electron diffraction, aberration corrected high-resolution (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy along with density functional theory calculations show that these nanotubes consist of alternating layers of SrCoO 2 and CoO 2. We have studied systematically the effect of base concentration on the structure and composition of the nanotubes, which reveals the importance of misfit stress to <b>tightly</b> <b>roll</b> the structure into tubular form and thus control the synthesis. Electronic structure calculations find that the structures are semiconducting with a ferrimagnetic ground state. Our studies further extend the family of bulk misfit layered oxides into the 1 D realm with potential applications in thermoelectric and electronic devices...|$|R
50|$|Carex subnigricans {{produces}} stems no {{taller than}} about 20 centimeters from {{a network of}} thin rhizomes. The thin leaves are <b>rolled</b> <b>tightly</b> and resemble quills. The inflorescence is generally oval and pointed in shape {{and one or two}} centimeters long.|$|R
25|$|Cigars: Cigars are <b>tightly</b> <b>rolled</b> {{bundles of}} dried and {{fermented}} tobacco which are ignited so that smoke may {{be drawn into}} the smoker's mouth. They are generally not inhaled {{because of the high}} alkalinity of the smoke, which can quickly become irritating to the trachea and lungs. The prevalence of cigar smoking varies depending on location, historical period, and population surveyed, and prevalence estimates vary somewhat depending on the survey method. The United States is the top consuming country by far, followed by Germany and the United Kingdom; the US and Western Europe account for about 75% of cigar sales worldwide. As of 2005 it is estimated that 4.3% of men and 0.3% of women smoke cigars in the USA.|$|E
25|$|Cavalry {{weapons and}} armor. Among the Fulani-Hausa armies of Sokoto, both horse and rider were shielded. The horse was {{generally}} covered by quilted cotton, stuffed with kapok fiber, and its rider generally rode into battle with finely wrought chain mail, or heavy quilted armor. The chain mail armor showed similarities to Mameluke design, but the quilting combined local invention with religious inspiration. Local armorers sew <b>tightly</b> <b>rolled</b> wads of paper inscribed with Quranic verses into {{the layers of}} cotton, and kapok. Whatever their spiritual powers, they could often blunt sword cuts, but were less effective against arrows. Body armor was supplemented by reinforced leather helmets, and tough shields of elephant or hippo hide. Horse stirrups often made effective weapons in a close fought melee, disemboweling enemy mounts and wounding enemy infantry.|$|E

6000|$|If {{the days}} of Egyptian Mummies are past, how dare Mrs. Prodgit require, {{for the use of}} my son, an amount of flannel and linen that would carpet my humble roof? Do I wonder that she {{requires}} it? No! This morning, within an hour, I beheld this agonising sight. I beheld my son - Augustus George - in Mrs. Prodgit's hands, and on Mrs. Prodgit's knee, being dressed. He was at the moment, comparatively speaking, in a state of nature; having nothing on, but an extremely short shirt, remarkably disproportionate to the length of his usual outer garments. Trailing from Mrs. Prodgit's lap, on the floor, was a long narrow roller or bandage - I should say of several yards in extent. In this, I SAW Mrs. Prodgit <b>tightly</b> <b>roll</b> the body of my unoffending infant, turning him over and over, now presenting his unconscious face upwards, now the back of his bald head, until the unnatural feat was accomplished, and the bandage secured by a pin, which I have every reason to believe entered the body of my only child.

50|$|Another {{form of an}} {{illuminated}} manuscript is a prayer roll, which traditionally included images from the Armenian iconography as well as Biblical passages or teachings but at a much smaller size was a more personal, and portable, religious treasure. Armenian prayer rolls could include iconography applicable to all Christian sects such as images of St. Mark, or St. Luke, or St. John as well as panels depicting important moments {{in the life of}} Jesus Christ. For the Armenians, however, the rolls would also include illustrations specific to the history of their country or church. These included St. Gregory the Illuminator credited with bringing Christianity to Armenian in the 4th century or St. Nerses IV important to the growth of Christianity in Armenia in the 12th century as well as establishing the theology of icon veneration within the Armenian Church. As in the case of other traditional Armenian manuscripts, prayer rolls were drawn and illustrated by hand on vellum. The scroll served as a personal talisman for the protection of its owner or for needs and prayer intentions of members of their family. Prayer rolls were narrow in width and included panels of religious illustration followed by religious text. The rolls were always quite long although exact measurements varied, depending on the number of panels it contained. The owner of this religious artifact could <b>tightly</b> <b>roll</b> the vellum and conceal it when carried. Concealment was crucial for protection of the prayer roll, since {{illuminated manuscript}}s and prayer rolls were highly valued and targeted by thieves. Devout Armenians held manuscripts and other works of art of the Church in high regard due to the fact the church and its teachings were an important part of daily life in medieval Armenia; the church fulfilled all spiritual, social, moral and cultural needs.|$|R

6000|$|I {{must first}} make the reader {{understand}} what I mean by a wall's being gathered up. Take {{a piece of}} tolerably thick drawing-paper, or thin Bristol board, five or six inches square.

60|$|Immediately after supper, {{they all}} lay down to sleep, but, for a time, each {{motionless}} form that lay <b>rolled</b> <b>tightly</b> in its blanket like an Egyptian mummy, sent {{a series of}} little puffs from its head.

60|$|Presently these {{thoughts}} were {{distracted by the}} sight of a back strangely familiar. The back belonged to a gentleman who was energetically climbing the embankment in front of him, on the top of which Major Sexton, a regular, army officer, sat his horse. The gentleman was pulling a small boy after him by one hand, and held a newspaper <b>tightly</b> <b>rolled</b> in the other. Stephen smiled to himself when it came over him that this gentleman was none other than that Mr. William T. Sherman he had met in the street car the day before. Somehow Stephen was fascinated by the decision and energy of Mr. Sherman's slightest movements. He gave Major Saxton a salute, quick and genial. Then, almost with one motion he unrolled the newspaper, pointed to a paragraph, and handed it to the officer. Major Saxton was still reading when a drunken ruffian clambered up the bank behind them and attempted to pass through the lines. The column began to move forward. Mr. Sherman slid down the bank with his boy into the grove beside Stephen. Suddenly there was a struggle. A corporal pitched the drunkard backwards over the bank, and he rolled at Mr. Sherman's feet. With a curse, he picked himself up, fumbling in his pocket. There was a flash, and as the smoke rolled from before his eyes, Stephen saw a man of a German regiment stagger and fall.|$|E
6000|$|Scattered about {{upon the}} ground now slowly {{narrowing}} by the encroachment of this awful march to water, were certain articles to which, in the leader's mind, were coupled no significant associations: an occasional blanket, <b>tightly</b> <b>rolled</b> lengthwise, doubled and the ends bound {{together with a}} string; a heavy knapsack here, and there a broken rifle--such things, in short, as {{are found in the}} rear of retreating troops, the [...] "spoor" [...] of men flying from their hunters. Everywhere near the creek, which here had a margin of lowland, the earth was trodden into mud by the feet of men and horses. An observer of better experience in the use of his eyes would have noticed that these footprints pointed in both directions; the ground had been twice passed over--in advance and in retreat. A few hours before, these desperate, stricken men, with their more fortunate and now distant comrades, had penetrated the forest in thousands. Their successive battalions, breaking into swarms and re-forming in lines, had passed the child on every side--had almost trodden on him as he slept. The rustle and murmur of their march had not awakened him. Almost within a stone's throw of where he lay they had fought a battle; but all unheard by him were the roar of the musketry, the shock of the cannon, [...] "the thunder of the captains and the shouting." [...] He had slept through it all, grasping his little wooden sword with perhaps a tighter clutch in unconscious sympathy with his martial environment, but as heedless of the grandeur of the struggle as the dead who had died to make the glory.|$|E
50|$|This rush is a {{perennial}} plant forming tufts of rough, rigid stems and leaves. It is gray-green in color. The plant {{may appear to}} be leafless at first glance, but what look like sharp-pointed stems are actually stiff leaves <b>rolled</b> <b>tightly</b> to form pointed cylinders. The true stems are tipped with inflorescences. It grows from a rhizome. This plant is variable in appearance. Its size and shape depend on environmental conditions in its salt marsh habitat. In areas with low soil salinity the plant can exceed two meters in height, whereas in high-salinity areas the rush is dwarfed, sometimes measuring under 30 centimeters (12 in.) tall. Both large and small plants generally occur in one marsh, with the large plants nearest the open water and the small plants occurring on higher ground in the salt flats and other areas of higher salinity. Plants of different sizes differ genetically, as well, with soil salinity being the selective force leading to the genetic variation. The dwarf plants have an adaptation to high soil salinity. Larger plants lack this adaptation, and do not survive when experimentally transplanted to high-salinity environments.|$|R
40|$|Several {{physiological}} responses were compared, under irrigated and water-stressed conditions, {{in an attempt}} to explain the reasons for the greater reduction in dry matter production of rice compared with maize and sorghum in a water-limiting environment. Leaf water potential and leaf rolling were determined weekly, soil water profiles and root length density twice, and leaf osmotic potential once during a long dry period. Root length density of rice was at least as high as that of maize and sorghum in the top 0 · 6 m layer of soil in both the wet and dry trials. There was no difference in water extraction among the 3 species from this layer, while rice extracted less water than did the other species from below 0 · 6 m. High variability among replicates precluded any conclusion being drawn regarding root length in the deeper layer. Leaf water potential, measured in the early afternoon, was consistently lower in rice than in maize and sorghum, even when soil water content was high, indicating high internal resistance to the flow of water in the rice plants. The low leaf water potential in rice was accompanied by low osmotic potential, and this assisted in maintenance of turgor and dry matter growth when soil water content was relatively high. As soil water content decreased, however, leaf water potential became very low (less than − 2 · 5 MPa) and, for rice, leaves <b>rolled</b> <b>tightly...</b>|$|R
60|$|The sketch {{represents}} {{a section of}} the pack-saddle, at the place where one of the hooks is situated on either side, but the front of the kegs themselves, and not their section, is given. Above and between the kegs lies a bag, and a strap passing from the near side of the saddle goes over the whole burden, and is buckled to a similar short strap on the other side. It is of importance that the bung-hole should be placed even nearer to the rim than where it is drawn, for it is necessary that it should be convenient to pour out of and to pour into, and that it should be placed on the highest part of the keg, both when on the beast's back and also when it stands on the ground, lest water should leak and be lost. According to the above plan, when water is ladled into it, the rim keeps it from spilling; and in pouring out water, the run acts as a spout. In making the bung-hole, a metal plate, with a screw-hole in it, is firmly fixed {{in the face of the}} cask; into this a wooden stopper, bound with iron, is made to screw (natives would probably steal a metal one). The stopper has a small head and a deeply-cut neck, by which it is tied to the cask, and its body has a large hole bored in it, which admits of a stick being put through, to prize it round, if it should become jammed. A spigot, to screw into the bung-hole on arriving at camp, might be really useful; but if used, a gimlet-hole must be bored in the cask to act as an air-vent. A large tundish is very convenient, and a spare plug might be taken; but a traveller, with a little painstaking, could soon cut a plug with his own knife, sufficiently well made to allow of its being Firmly screwed in, and of retaining the water, if it had a bit of rag wrapped round it.
