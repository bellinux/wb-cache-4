40|$|This Handbook {{discusses}} different possible {{approaches to}} the primary issuance of government debt, that is to say, {{the point at which}} the debt - normally in securitised, or tradable, form - is first sold by the government to the non-state sector. The main focus of the Handbook is on auctions of <b>tradable</b> <b>debt,</b> in part because this is the means predominantly used by developed, developing and transitional countries which issue debt to the non-state sector to finance the government’s deficit. But it also covers other means of selling <b>tradable</b> <b>debt,</b> and some aspects of non-tradable debt. The Handbook considers some of the key factors affecting uncertainty and demand in the primary market. In general there will be a cost to uncertainty (where investors are unsure about a number of aspects of the debt issuance programme), and to exclusivity (where access to part or all of the primary market is restricted in some way). But uncertainty may be the counterpart to a measure of flexibility, and exclusivity the counterpart to manageability. Debt managers need to decide where, in view of the structure and state of development of their markets, to make the trade-offs. The Handbook also discusses a number of practical operational issues. An Appendix describes in detail some of the features of index-linked securities. An earlier Handbook (No. 5 The management of government debt, see Related Links) discussed the relative merits of fixed and floating interest securities, but covered indexed securities only briefly.

40|$|Markets for debt {{securities}} {{exist in a}} comprehensive way in no Asian economy other than Japan, even though short or medium-term bonds have been issued in almost all and Asian borrowers are established (though not prolific) international issuers. The markets provide {{no more than a}} simple borrowing medium for governments, banks and some companies, while investor activity is closely correlated with banking sector credit creation. Above all, the region¡¦s unfinished markets provide no guard against crisis or contagion, nor act as a balance to banking systems that are susceptible to distortion and event risk. Insufficient effort has been made to encourage activity by institutional investors. This paper is concerned with markets for <b>tradable</b> <b>debt</b> securities; and with the value and appropriateness of structured finance techniques to expand general usage of Asia¡¦s debt markets. The paper examines the condition of the domestic and offshore debt capital markets for Asia-Pacific risk. It traces common patterns of development among the established and nascent public {{debt securities}} markets in the region, and looks at the dynamics that will affect these markets in the medium term. Last, it seeks to identify whether Asian markets can be made to accommodate continuous issuing and trading activity typical of advanced economies, and to consider the associated advantages and considerations. ...|$|E

In this paper we present an empirical study of the dynamics of Brady bonds OAS using a heath, Jarrow and Morton term structure pricing model. The dynamics of the spread shows that the proper risk management and pricing of these securities require the consideration of volatility in addition to the magnitude of the sovereign risk spread. That is, the proper risk measure for these securities would be the pair (OAS, OAS Volatility). A study of implied default probabilities is also presented.

40|$|Retracing the {{financial}} revolutions {{that took place}} in continental Europe in the 19 th century, this work focuses on investment banking patterns’ comparison in France, Germany and, especially, Italy, in the long run. Besides supporting the industrialization process, in fact, major large investment banks probably represented the most important financial innovation after the establishment of issuing banks and of standardized <b>tradable</b> public <b>debt.</b> As such, they had a relevant role in building and shaping those countries’ emerging financial and credit systems, giving birth to modern banking. The paper considers great banks’ evolution between the 1860 s and the Great War, verifying and assessing differences and similarities among them, taking into consideration the structure of single banks. Quantitative analysis shows that relevant differences emerged in the evolution of investment banking patterns in the three countries before 1914. The deepening of these differences during the period supports the hypothesis that divergence, rather than convergence, characterized investment banking patterns in continental Europe. The paper eventually tries to give reasons for such an outcome referring to institutional frameworks’ peculiarities, rather than relying on classical explanations involving the permanence of economic growth differentials among countries or of different speeds in their economic convergence...|$|R
40|$|In one of {{the more}} {{influential}} papers in economic history of the past twenty years, North and Weingast (1989) described the connections between a singular event, the English Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the subsequent evolution of political institutions and capital markets in Great Britain. Although it is usually difficult to argue that a particular series of events represents a true watershed in history, the arguments presented in their paper are quite persuasive in regards to public finance. In terms of both scale and unit cost of public finance, there is little similarity between the reigns of the Stuart and of the early Hanoverian monarchs. From about 1688 it is clear that a train events was put in motion that would transform the relation between government and finance. North and Weingast persuasively argued that these events were: 1) royal political revolution, followed by 2) the complete seizure of taxation powers by Parliament and by 3) an extension of Parliamentary oversight of expenditure – all of which were made necessary by the financial exigencies of prolonged large-scale European warfare. These processes were coupled with the rise of a market for <b>tradable</b> government <b>debt,</b> which was in turn accompanied by the development of a smaller market for joint-stock company equity securities.

40|$|When new {{international}} statistical standards {{were published in}} 1993, {{one of the major}} changes to the recommended presentation of the system of national accounts and the balance of payments was the adoption of accruals reporting for income and expenditure. However, as countries have begun to implement these standards, questions have arisen about their exact interpretation in respect of interest flows associated with <b>tradable</b> <b>debt,</b> where the cash flow is fixed at the time of issue but where the price of the instrument fluctuates with market conditions. A clear consensus has yet to emerge. The paper explores the issues involved in using the alternative approaches, the so-called "debtor" and "creditor" approaches. The debtor approach uses the rate implicit at the time of issue, and the creditor approach, the current market rate. The paper concludes that the creditor approach is the only one consistent with accrual principles and market valuation for the debt outstanding. It reviews implications for national and sectoral saving from this approach.

40|$|Includes bibliographyForeword by Alicia Bárcena. This report {{examines}} how the access of Latin American and Caribbean countries to external debt financing has {{evolved in the}} three decades since the debt crisis of 1982. In these thirty years, as the global financial environment evolved and structural shifts {{took place in the}} region, the market for Latin American and Caribbean <b>tradable</b> <b>debt</b> opened, deepened and broadened, developing from an unsecuritized loan market in the 1980 s to a robust and improved securitized bond market {{by the end of the}} period. The study highlights how bond financing today is very different from what it was in the 1980 s and 1990 s and how access to external bond financing has become more widespread and less costly. Through the analysis of the forces behind the evolution of spreads, issuance and credit ratings, the report shows that by the end of 2012, debt spreads had declined considerably from the high levels prevalent in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s; the composition of debt issuance had shifted from sovereigns to the corporate sector and to local markets; debt was issued on a broader range of currencies; credit quality had improved substantially; and Latin American and Caribbean external debt attracted a larger and more diversified investor base. From 1982 to 2012, several countries in the region moved from facing a shortage of funds to learning how best to manage available financing options. Access to external debt financing is not universal, however, and despite increased resilience, vulnerability to external financial shocks can still be a threat. I.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three original articles {{in the field of}} general equilibrium with incomplete markets and general equilibrium with asymmetric information, and an introduction to the theory, which traces its development and embeds the following chapters in a common framework. In Pareto Improving Trade Restrictions in an Incomplete Markets Economy, we consider a stylised three period one good general equilibrium model with incomplete security markets. We show that the introduction of an indiscriminate marginal constraint on security trades can lead to a Pareto improvement, even though all prices are endogenous and agents are fully rational and have symmetric information. In Signaling Credit Quality Independently of Contract Choice: a Non-Transaction Cost Approach to Swaps in Anonymous Markets, we demonstrate that under two conditions, swaps are non-redundant securities in anonymous financial markets. Firstly, there is asymmetric information over the project payoff which is financed by swaps. And secondly, borrowers are restricted from being investors at the same time. If either of this condition fails, then swaps are redundant assets. Swaps permit a constrained optimal solution to an asymmetric information problem. Finally, Anonymous Corporate Bond Markets with Asymmetric Information, the main article of this thesis, shows that in an anonymous credit market which is characterised by limited liability and asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders, the nominal rate of interest on <b>tradable</b> <b>debt</b> (the coupon rate) sorts borrowers by their riskiness and in this way has an indirect influence on the price and quantity of bonds traded in equilibrium. This is in contrast to symmetric information models, in which the nominal coupon rate has no function. The paper claims that the adverse sorting effect of the nominal interest rate, as in Stiglitz-Weiss (1981), is maintained in a competitive setting, but that, even though changes in the nominal interest rate result in non-monotonic changes in the deliveries of agents, the orderly functioning of markets is not impaired...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} a number of issues that are of importance in the current European bond market. In the past years, the fiscal policy of the Eurozone members, advances in the technology of trading platforms and the introduction of a single currency have reshaped the fixed income markets in Europe. These developments have resulted in a far going integration of Eurozone capital markets. Moreover, the massive amounts of debt issued by Japan and the United States combined with the deteriorating stock markets in 2000 - 2002 have also resulted in an increased asset allocation to European bonds. Currently, the Eurozone bond market is the third largest market in the world with the German Schatze, Bobl and Bund futures among the heaviest traded financial contracts. In recent years, the empirical work on the microstructure of financial markets has received considerable attention in the academic literature. Most of the substantial empirical work in this area pertains to stock markets. Given the emphasis on stock markets in the theory and the availability of data, this is understandable. On the other hand, in terms of both capitalization and trading volume, bond markets are bigger than stock markets. Research on bond markets is also interesting because of their special structure. These markets are centered around a large number of professional dealers. Outside customers trade with the dealer of their choice. Volume is high and interdealer trading is frequently being observed. This work could be divided into two parts. The first part focused on the microstructure of European bond markets. The second part focused on the growing European inflation-linked bond market. Notice that throughout this dissertation, we distinguished between market participants who can set new prices (market makers or dealers) and market participants that can only take prices (traders). In the first part, we turned our attention to the microstructure of Eurozone bond markets by studying the Belgian. French. German, and Italian bonds. We started with a review of microstructure literature in chapter 2 and studied inventory and information models. For inventory models, the equilibrium price formed by dealers compensates for non-optimal inventory positions while the equilibrium price in information models protects against adverse selection. Because a competitive market structure prevails in the Eurozone bond market, interdealer trading is important. We therefore provided a discussion about interdealer trading and its impact on the formation of prices. We showed that in these interdealer models, inventory and information asymmetry are still important because order flows are sources of private information. This private information, combined with risk-averse speculation among dealers, will result in strategic interdealer behavior. We ended chapter 2 with a discussion about some variables that could be observed by an econometrician and therefore useful for testing market microstructure topics. We turned our attention to the bid-ask spread, price volatility and order flow. The bid-ask spread is an important instrument for dealers because it controls the incoming and outgoing order flow, it compensates dealers for their market making activity and it serves as a [...] protection against adverse selection. Based on quote data, one can calculate the average,, effective and realized spread. Based on transaction data, one can calculate implicit trading costs. An important role is also put aside for price volatility. According to theory, the more informed traders we have, the more price volatility will occur as market makers will change their quotes more often to protect themselves against adverse selection. The empirical papers indeed support this idea and show that the arrival of information is an important contributor to intraday price volatility [...] Monitoring order flow is also crucial in financial markets. Even if markets are driven by publicly available news, there exist information asymmetry in the form of private order flow as it can observed only by the parties involved in the transaction. In addition, the impact of order flow is time-varying. Not only does it depend on the size and its direction, but also on the arrival of information in the market. In chapter 3, we turned our attention to the trading activity of the MTS Global Market system, which is the most important European interdealer fixed income trading system. This system is composed of a number of trading platforms on which designated bonds can be traded. The trading system is fully automated and effectively works as an electronic limit order market. The first interesting feature of the MTS trading platform is its organizational setup. Fixed income securities can be traded on a domestic and an European (EuroMTS) platform. The range of securities being traded on the domestic platform is however much larger than on the EuroMTS trading platform. A dealer on the domestic trading platform can therefore trade a much wider range of bonds. However, the existence of both trading platforms suggests differences and we therefore asked ourselves the following question: Why would a market maker with entrance to the local platforms also operate on the EuroMTS trading platform? To answer this question, a detailed study on the costs and the dynamics of price formation is needed. Throughout the paper, we provided a comparison of the trading costs and price dynamics on the domestic MTS markets and the EuroMTS by calculating comparative measures of liquidity, such as the quoted and effective spread. We showed that despite the apparent fragmentation of trading on domestic platforms and EuroMTS. the markets are closely connected in terms of liquidity. The second interesting feature of the MTS Global Market system is its pure interdealer platform. This allowed us to study the price and order flow dynamics under competitive market making. We asked ourselves: What are the dynamics of prices in the Eurozone fixed income market under competitive market making and interdealer trading'. '' What is the role of trading intensity? Interestingly. the study of trading intensity and its relation to price and order flow dynamics do not explicitly take the role of interdealer trading into consideration. Single dealer models argue that there exist a positive relation between information and trading intensity as more informed traders arc active during large market activity. This means that any unexpected trade during active trading has a higher impact on prices [...] Some authors also documented the same empirical results. We think that interdealer trading may shed a different light on these results. Dealers use interdealer trading to control their inventory position but interdealer trading is more costly compared to outside customer trading because dealers have to pay a fee (to the otherr dealer) rather than receiving a fee (from an outside customer). In addition, there is less need to adjust the spread as traders enter the market on a frequent basis, which by definition occur during high market activity. Next to these searching costs, interdealer trading can also result in a repeated passing of inventory among dealers as they have the moral obligation to quote prices. The repeated passing of inventory is called "hot-potato" trading and this creates noise in the pricing process when dealers are risk averse and speculative. In other words, a dealer's decision to conduct an interdealer trade depends on his ability to offset his inventory using customer order flow [...] Not only is this cheaper compared to interdealer trading; it also avoids the "hot-potato"" process. This implies that the price impact of a trade is much larger during periods where trading intensity is low because customer flows are scarce. Our data provided an opportunity to test this. We documented the following: order flows are strongly correlated but the correlation gradually decreases over time. We also found the impact of a trade in a low trading intensive environment having a larger impact on price than in a high trading intensive environment. This contrasts the findings for stock markets but confirms the dealer's preference to trade with outside customers rather than the more costly interdealer trading. When we took announcement effects into consideration, we found the overall price sensitivity to order flow being stronger and this reflects the information asymmetry in order flow. However,, this price sensitivity is magnified when trading activity is low. The latter too calculate the inflation premium within a break-even framework, expected inflation extracted from survey data is incorporated. The inflation premium is then the difference between the nominal yield, real yields and the expected inflation. Still, the proposed method assumes that the index-linked curve estimated from inflationlinked price data is equal to the real term structure of interest rates. There is however a difference due to liquidity and imperfect indexation. Most papers focusing on the liquidity premium do understand the importance of liquidity but do not explicitly model liquidity as a driving factor of bond prices. It is well known however that liquid securities are traded at a premium. Taking liquidity into account allowed us to use data on both nominal and inflation-linked debt in markets where the outstanding amount of inflation linked debt is small. In France for example, the fraction of inflation-linked bonds stands at 7 % of total debt while the Italian treasury estimates that some 1. 3 % of its current debt is inflation-linked. The US treasury market is the worlds largest inflation-linked bond market and the outstanding amount of treasury inflation protected securities (or TIPS) equals 150 billion. This is approximately 6 % of the total outstanding tradable US treasury debt. To some extent, the problem of liquidity can be avoided by analyzing the UK bond market because almost 25 % of their <b>tradable</b> <b>debt</b> is inflation linked. The objective chapter 5 is to estimate the inflation premium by taking liquidity into account. This allowed us to study the empirical properties of the term structure of real rates in the Eurozone bond market. We used data from French index-linked and nominal bonds and estimate the inflation and liquidity premium in a state space framework using the extended Kalman filter and quasi-maximum likelihood. In particular, we simultaneously derived the nominal and real term structure of interest rates and this enabled us to calculate the price of any discount bond. In order to fit coupon bearing bonds into an affine structure, we used the extended Kalman filter to linearize the state equations. A state space approach is also useful for taking advantage of cross-sectionall and timeseries behavior of nominal and real rates and this should reduce the instability of timeseries. Our findings are as follows: in the absence of liquidity, the inflation premium runs from 113 basis points to some 250 basis points across the curve. These numbers implies that the inflation premium in long-term bonds is more than 2 times larger compared with the short-end of the curve and comparable with US TIPS. The liquidity premium in real bonds equals some 6 basis points for bonds maturing in 2009 and is slightly humped shaped with a peak at the 10 -year bond. If liquidity is taken into consideration, the expected nominal yield spread between nominal and real bonds equals some 15 basis points in the short end of the curve but increases to 135 basis points in the long end of the curve. For shortterm (long-term) bonds, the liquidity premium accounts for some 5 % (10 %) of the total real risk premium. On the other hand, the inflation premium is a prominent factor in nominal bonds as it account for more than 50 % of the total risk premium across the term structure for nominal interest rates. As a final remark, although the contribution of the liquidity premium to total premium is small, it has a large impact on the expected nominal yield spread through the expected liquidity level. We find that this yield spread is upward sloping as it runs from 76 basis points to some 198 basis points for the 2032 bond...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographyIntroducción During the 1990 s {{the market}} for Latin America's debt grew in volume, types of {{instruments}} traded and number of investors and trade houses involved. Investors were drawn by high growthpotential and high yields in most Latin American countries, {{as well as by}} a general trend towards the implementation of economic and political reforms. As a result, the relative size of Latin America's market worldwide grew. This growth, however, was affected by a series of market events that underscored Latin America's vulnerability to financial shocks. Growth in trading volumes and asset values was first interrupted in 1994, in the aftermath of Mexico's peso devaluation in mid-December. Mexico's devaluation set in motion 'contagion' (the 'tequila effect');, which depressed market values throughout Latin America and other emerging markets during early 1995. Investor confidence recovered by mid- 1995, following the massive rescue package for Mexico organized by the International Monetary Fund with support from United States and other G- 7 countries. Capital flows to Latin America and other emerging markets grew considerably for the next two years. Market conditions were favorable until the onset of financial and economic difficulties in Southeast Asia in mid- 1997. Market contagion spread these difficulties to Russia by mid- 1998, which in turn led to more general, and more severe, contagion throughout the emerging markets {{in the latter half of}} 1998. The resulting loss of investor confidence eventually led to Brazil's January 1999 devaluation. An essential element of external financing in the 1990 s was increasing access to the international bond market. The importance of bond financing as a source of external funding to Latin America rose substantially, with the number and value of bonds issued surging considerably over the course of the decade. Bond financing is currently one of the fastest growing sources of external development financing, being second only to foreign direct investment. On average, bond financing became the second major source of funding in Latin America in the 1990 s. In order to assess the role of bonds as a source of external finance in Latin America in the 1990 s, it is important to understand the behavior and evolution of bond spreads and the changes in debt composition due to liability management. This paper looks first at the role of the Brady plan, which redefined Latin America's integration into the global economy during the 1990 s, as well as the role of debt buybacks and swaps. The changes in the composition of sovereign debt throughout the decade and the behavior of spreads are also analyzed, including the influence of credit ratings on Latin American bond spreads. In the 1990 s the outstanding stock and volume of sovereign <b>tradable</b> Latin American <b>debt</b> showed an unprecedented increase, as it became increasingly liquid with the development of secondary markets. As liquidity increased, Latin American debt markets became more volatile. Bond flows to Latin America experienced strong volatility throughout the decade and were strongly concentrated in middle-income countries, particularly in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Spreads responded not only to economic fundamentals, but were subject to market sentiment as well. As a result, issues of financial volatility and contagion were particularly relevant to Latin American countries...|$|R
