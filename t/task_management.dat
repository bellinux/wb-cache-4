The tasks assigned to the meta-AI were so numerous and large that {{it needed to be}} divided into separate interconnected elements, which included implementing a hierarchical structure for <b>task</b> <b>management,</b> transitioning and the merger of functions to create an intelligent system, and the exchange of various elements with specific localities. For the character-AI, a major point was the coordination between the AI and character animations when responding to different situations. Different levels and styles of AI were created for different groups of non-playable characters within XVs world, from the main party members to NPCs around the world. To ensure the navigation-AI worked properly for enemies and monsters, a system dubbed the [...] "Point Query System" [...] (PQS) was created, which could direct and steer them in a realistic manner while avoiding collisions with objects in the environment or other moving elements. A PQS was created for each enemy type, and made small changes to their behaviors easier to implement. The decision to create high-quality reactive AI for Noctis' companions helped influence the choice of making Noctis the only playable character.|$|E
