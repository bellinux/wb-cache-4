5|$|A {{letter from}} Julius II to Henry VII dated 6 July 1504, remarks <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> {{had chosen the}} pope's {{cardinal}}-nephew Galeotto della Rovere as cardinal protector; the letter does not mention Castellesi. della Rovere's selection was likely arranged by Gigli. Castellesi was compensated by being promoted to the wealthier See of Bath and Wells. Castellesi lost favour with the king and fled Rome until the death of Julius II.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march. Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Bertie and Lionel come {{together}} after King Edward decides to abdicate {{in order to}} marry Simpson, and Bertie becomes King George VI.

5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign. The tombs {{of many of}} his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, in a few cases, even record letters <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed on the walls of tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E

5|$|Foliot was Becket's rival for the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He {{objected to}} the king's choice {{on the grounds that}} Becket was too worldly, the only bishop or magnate known to have opposed the king's choice. When the newly elected {{archbishop}} was presented to the court before his consecration, Foliot remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> had performed a miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop. Soon after Becket's consecration the king wrote to the pope asking for permission to make Foliot the royal confessor. This may have been a conciliatory move to appease Foliot after the loss of Canterbury, or it may have been <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> and the new archbishop were already having differences of opinion and the king wished Foliot to be a counter-weight to Becket's influence.|$|E

5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>King</b> would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 FIDE {{added the}} variant Chess960 to the {{appendix}} of the Laws of Chess. Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with the conditions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> is placed {{somewhere between the}} two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> had said Becket was free to return at any time, but {{would still have to}} answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, although {{there is no evidence that}} Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E

5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E
5|$|The {{aforesaid}} {{kings of}} Bǫglunga sǫgur most likely refer to Rǫgnvaldr and his son, Guðrøðr (died 1231), {{although it is}} not impossible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> 'Rǫgnvaldr' in this source may instead refer to Ragnall, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> 'Guðrøðr' in it may actually refer to Rǫgnvaldr himself, since the latter's father was named Guðrøðr. Whatever the case, the events depicted in Bǫglunga sǫgur appear to show that, in the wake of destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles, which may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment from Scandinavia, Rǫgnvaldr and his son (or instead perhaps Ragnall and Rǫgnvaldr) travelled to Norway where they rendered homage to the Norwegian king, and made compensation for unpaid taxes.|$|E
5|$|The chapter asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> {{should be}} truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, {{have faith in}} gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|E

5|$|The {{contrast}} between Jacques-Louis David's {{depiction of the}} same scene (of Napoleon traversing the Alps {{on his way to}} Italy), which was a flattering portrait <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> of Spain requested for Napoleon (as a gift) and Delaroche's depiction in Bonaparte Crossing the Alps is easily apparent.|$|E
5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this surprising {{turn of events}} defused the situation, but to many observers the scene on the balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance. However pleased {{it may have been}} by the royal displays, the crowd insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> come back with them to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{developed}} a strong doctrine of double predestination independently of John Calvin. His interpretation was that God's will determines both damnation {{as well as}} salvation. Vermigli's belief is similar but not identical to Calvin's. Vermigli's political theology was important in the Elizabethan religious settlement; he provided theological justification for Royal Supremacy, the doctrine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> of a territory, rather than any ecclesiastical authority, rules the church.|$|E

5|$|After Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Bethune first {{supported}} King Stephen, who seized the throne from Henry's heiress the Empress Matilda, but when Matilda's forces captured Stephen, Bethune switched sides to support Matilda. When Matilda did not secure the throne, Bethune once more switched back to supporting Stephen. Construction of Hereford Cathedral was completed under Bethune's episcopate, and consecrated in 1142 and 1148. Stephen appointed Bethune {{as one of}} the English bishops <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> allowed to attend the Council of Reims in 1148, and Bethune died there in April 1148. A hagiography is the only surviving evidence of Bethune's cathedral chapter's attempts to promote him as a saint.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>King</b> had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
