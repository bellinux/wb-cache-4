5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E
5|$|John Ehrlichman, {{a long-time}} friend of Haldeman, {{who had also}} served as White House Counsel, {{had been part of}} the operation's inception; at this time he was Nixon's {{domestic}} affairs assistant. Ehrlichman was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> initially hired Caulfield in 1969; Ehrlichman intended for Caulfield to conduct private investigation while undercover as a private sector employee, it was Caulfield who insisted on working from the White House. Caulfield's work to this end had already resulted in two wiretaps on phone lines—one on Nixon's brother Donald, and another on journalist Joseph Kraft.|$|E

In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E

5|$|KroniK helped The Boogie Knights battle The Filthy Animals in {{subsequent}} matches at Mayhem and Millennium Final. As the year ended, KroniK were hired by their former enemies, the Natural Born Thrillers, {{during which they}} helped them at the Starrcade event, by facing Reno and Big Vito in a tag team match, during which Reno turned on Vito and had been revealed as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> paid KroniK to assault Vito in the previous weeks. A month later, at Sin, KroniK turned faces by ending their association with Thrillers, as they turned on Thrillers leader Mike Sanders by helping Ernest Miller beat Sanders to become the WCW Commissioner. The following month, at SuperBrawl Revenge, KroniK made their final pay-per-view appearance, where they were scheduled to face Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell), in a #1 contender's match for the tag team titles. Clark was injured by Mike Awesome before the match, leaving Adams to face them in a handicap match, which he lost. KroniK remained with WCW until the company was purchased by WWF on March 23, 2001.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 2017, Édouard was {{suspected}} of having shot at a passer-by with an airsoft gun on 11 February, injuring him in the head. As {{a result of the}} incident, he was interrogated by police and his loan was prematurely terminated by Toulouse. At the time of his loan being cancelled, Edouard had made 17 appearances and scored one goal for Toulouse. It was later revealed that his teammate, Mathieu Cafaro, had confessed to being <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> fired the gun. Cafaro later recanted, however, and on 13 June the Toulouse Prosecutor asked that Édouard be charged with a four months suspended prison sentence and a €6,000 fine for his involvement in the incident. Édouard alleged that Cafaro fired the shot while Cafaro claimed not to have been in the car {{at the time of the}} shooting. On 4 July, Édouard was sentenced to a suspended four months' prison sentence by the Correctional Court of Toulouse. He was also ordered to pay a fine of €6,000 as well as damages of €2,600 to the victim for the wounds suffered to his ear.|$|E
5|$|The twelve-minute sketch {{was written}} by Michael O'Donoghue who {{wanted to create a}} scene that would {{showcase}} the acting talents of John Belushi. O'Donoghue had been <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program. O'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run, but had become much more successful during syndication. Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk. He demonstrated his intense desire to get the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk's facial appearance in the original series. They worked together on the sketch for thirty-days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the show when it would be hosted by Elliott Gould.|$|E

5|$|As {{the gang}} exited the {{property}} and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape {{who was able to}} provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Goldring Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.|$|E
5|$|Irataba also welcomed {{bands of}} Yavapai onto the {{reservation}} {{after they had}} been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> turned them over to Crook.|$|E
