6000|$|Years ago I was {{concerned}} as chief mate {{in a case}} of stranding which was not fatal to the ship. We went to work for ten hours on end, laying out anchors in readiness <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>off</b> at high water. While I was still busy about the decks forward I heard the steward at my elbow saying: [...] "The captain asks whether you mean to come in, sir, and have something to eat to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|Neither now or at {{any time}} did Mr. Gladstone set too low a value on that great dead-lift effort, not too {{familiar}} in history, <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>off</b> a burden from {{the conscience of the}} nation, and set back the bounds of cruel wrong upon the earth. On the day after this performance, the entry in his diary is--'In the morning my father was greatly overcome, and I could hardly speak to him. Now is the time to turn this attack into measures of benefit for the negroes.' More than once {{in the course of the}} spring he showed how much in earnest he was about the negroes, by strenuously pressing his father to allow him to go to the West Indies and view the state of things there for himself. Perhaps by prudent instinct his father disapproved, and at last spoke decidedly against any project of the kind.|$|E

However, she soon reported that the severe storm had forced her <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> <b>off</b> Halifax, Nova Scotia, before carrying out her assignment. Before she could resume her mission, the object of her concern, Cadoras was later damaged so severely by the storm that she was abandoned as a total wreck.|$|R

50|$|On {{her first}} convict voyage, {{under the command}} of William Rayner Best, she {{departed}} Spithead, England on the 20 May 1823 and arrived at Hobart Town on the 21 October 1823. She transported 202 male convicts, but off loaded two convicts at Cape of Good Hope; no convicts died on the voyage. She left Hobart Town and arrived at Sydney in December. Albion was blown ashore at Mauritius in February 1824, with loss of her masts but was able <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Governor Philip, which {{arrived on}} Saturday last, from Moreton Bay and Port Macquarie, has {{brought up the}} crew of the ship America, bound from Hobart Town to Batavia, which was {{unfortunately}} wrecked on a coral reef, on the Northern Loo Islands. This disastrous occurrence took place about 1 o'clock in the morning of the 20th of June, when the vessel was running under three topsails and a foresail, {{in the midst of a}} black showery squall. All the sails were immediately clewed up and stowed, the stream anchor stocked, and every exertion made to endeavour <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>off,</b> but without effect; particularly as the darkness of the night and the heavy sea, rendered it quite impossible to lower a boat. The ship, meanwhile, continued heavily beating on the reef, and in about an hour after she struck, began to fill very fast. At 3 o'clock, there was about four-feet-water in the hold, and all the rudder-bands, the rudder-trunk, and part of the counter had been carried away. At day light, it was found that the ship had bilged, as the fore-hold was nearly half full of water. With considerable difficulty the long-boat and pinnace were got out, together with some provisions and other necessaries with which the crew made for a small island, on the same reef, about two miles N.N. W. of the wreck, where they remained until the boats were rigged, when they set sail for Moreton Bay, which place they reached on the 27th of June. The following are some interesting particulars of the proceedings of the crew, from the time the vessel struck up to their safe arrival at Moreton Bay:Monday, June 20th_Early this day the ship's company were employed in getting out the long- boat and pinnace, which they at length accomplished, and loaded them with a few casks of provisions and water, and all the people's clothes. About 11 o'clock a. m. they left the ship and made for a small island about two miles off, and landed, after tome difficulty, on the reef, and the. crew employed themselves in carrying the light goods to the island, until high-water, when the long-boat und pinnace were safely discharged. The long-boat was anchored outside the reef, and the pinnnce hauled upon the beach. At high-water the reef is quite covered, but is dry at low-water. A tent was erected on the island, and the dry goods placed under it. The people caught a turtle this evening.21st.-The pinnace was manned and proceeded to the wreck, out of which various goods were taken. A party was also sent in search of water, and to ascertain what the island produced. Not the least sign of water, nor a single fruit, of any kind, were found. The reef was covered with turtle, and the island abounded with birds, consisting, principally, of doves, magpies and sea fowl. This [...] "day the people shifted their tent to a more convenient spot among some trees, and. Under all the circumstances, made a tolerably comfortable abitation. Weather hot and sultry. Lat."23 44'.22d.-The pinnace and her crew were again dispatched to the wreck, and brought off various articles. A party also walked across the reef, to a dry part of which a rope was passed from the wreck, and by this means a great deal of property was saved. The labour, however, was excessive, owing, particularly, to the difficulty of walking on the reef, as the coral gave way almost at every step. The people's feet were dreadfully cut. A turtle was caught to-day, weighing: nearly 4 cwt. Crew all in good heath, and excellent spirits.23d.-Every thing of any use had been removed by this time, and the long-boat made ready for sea. The water began to get very low, without any prospect of obtaining a further supply. All the boats were got ready, and the people determined to make for Moreton Bay.24th to 30t/i.-Ready for sea, but waiting for a fair wind.July 1st to 6th.-Wind still foul.7th.-Early this morning the people put to sea with a fair wind at N.W. The day was remarkably fine, with a steady breeze throughout.8th.-The weather very unfavourable sea running high, with a fresh breeze. A quantity of provisions, and other stores, had been thrown overboard, from the long boat, to keep her from swamping. In the course of the night of the 7th, the boats passed an island, for which they this day bore up, and towards night, got under its lee.9th.-The crew landed took out all the boats cargo, and set to work to make them more sea-worthy. The main land of New South Wales was discernable from this island, on which the people remained till the 16th, when they were obliged to leave for want of water.16th:-Sailed, and on the following morning the boats were under the main land. Nothing particular occurred this day (l7th) or night, during the whole of which the boats sailed under the land.18th-About 12 o'clock p. m. the people went ashore on an island close to the main, where they fortunately found water, and having taken in a supply proceeded on their voyage.The weather was in general fine from this time up to the 27th, when the shipwrecked mariners reached Moreton Bay in safety, where they were most kindly received, and every assistance afforded them by the Commandant, of whose gentlemanly and humane conduct the sailors are loud in praise.|$|E

25|$|The Group arrived off of Barletta on 1 October, at 13:00. They <b>heaved</b> <b>to</b> <b>off</b> {{the harbor}} and were boarded by British Naval Officers in Charge, who {{instructed}} them to proceed to Manfredonia to discharge the cargo. At 14:30, they got underway for Manfredonia staying well inshore to avoid the unswept minefields off the coast. At 17:00 they entered Manfredonia harbor and discharged their tanks. She was the first ship to land tanks on the Adriatic coast.|$|R
60|$|While these dispositions were in progress, Raoul himself, {{assisted}} by his sailing-master, prepared <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> the lugger <b>off</b> the rocks. To this, at present {{the most important}} duty, our hero gave his personal inspection; for it required skill, judgment, and caution. The physical force of the crew was reserved {{to aid in the}} attempt. At length everything was ready, and the instant had arrived when the momentous trial was to be made. The lugger had now been ashore quite four hours, and the sun had been up fully three. By this time, Raoul calculated that the English, at Capri, knew of his misfortune, and little leisure remained in which to do a vast deal of work. The hands were all summoned to the bars, therefore, and the toil of heaving commenced.|$|R
60|$|Another gang {{was moving}} a kedge-anchor across the deck, {{while a few}} more coiled heavy ropes beside the winch. Mayne {{obviously}} meant <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> the vessel <b>off,</b> but Kit thought he would not succeed until the moon was full. In the meantime, cargo could only be landed when there was water enough to float boats up to the ship, and Kit glanced across the lagoon. There were no mangroves on the other side, although thick timber grew close down to a belt of sand. Below this was mud, across which he imagined heavy goods could not be carried. The heat and steamy damp made him languid, {{and he went to}} Adam's room. Adam had got up and sat, half-dressed, on the lower berth with a glass on the floor close by. His hands shook and there was no color in his lips.|$|R
5|$|During the day, the French {{strengthened}} {{the positions of}} both battered ships, soldiers from the surrounding area gathering on the beaches to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels. Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River. These troops were identified by Trial, which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate. With their evacuation covered from the shore, most of the crew were removed from Confiante, including all the wounded. The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening. Vésuve was in better condition and remained well protected. Her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> the ship <b>off</b> as the tide rose. Due to the strong French military presence, Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable.|$|R

60|$|The polacre had {{now taken}} its place to leeward {{of the other}} two vessels, and they held on in that order until the frigate was within half a mile; when she fired a gun across their bows, as signal for them <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> The brig was now flying the British colours; her prizes the British colours, with the Spanish {{underneath}} them.
