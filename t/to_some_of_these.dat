5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured and sold <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists {{have claimed that}} the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E

It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, prior of Gregory's own monastery of St Andrew in Rome, to {{head the}} mission to Kent. Gregory {{selected}} monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish kings. The pope wrote {{to a number of}} Frankish bishops on Augustine's behalf, introducing the mission and asking that Augustine and his companions be made welcome. Copies of letters <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> bishops survive in Rome. The pope wrote to King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, as well as their grandmother Brunhilda of Austrasia, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and were asked to allow some Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to ensure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which enjoyed the evident support of his wife's relatives and people. The Franks at that time were attempting to extend their influence in Kent, and assisting Augustine's mission furthered that goal. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.|$|E

5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And Then There Were None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not clear}} that the moot hill was also the actual site of executions; folklore, {{tradition}} and the association of separate 'gallow' places names with moot hills on balance suggests that the usual place of execution was a separate 'gallows hill'. At Gardyne Law however an eye witness recalled that judgement and execution took place on the same law. It does seems unlikely that in those superstitious days meetings would be held at places of death; at Mugdock separate moot and gallow hills are a good example. Such gallows may have been built of worked timber or a Dule Tree may have been used. RCAHMS records show that human bones have been frequently found in association with 'gallows' place name sites, but not at 'moot' sites. The term 'murder hole' may relate to the drowning sites, bones have been found close <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b>|$|E

Apax has countered {{that some of}} these bondholders only began their dispute after passing up on the chance of selling prior to the crash of 2007, and that Apax was not the legal owner of Hellas during the periods cited in some of the lawsuits. (In 2005 a New York judge awarded $56m <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> bondholders, made against Hellas Telecommunications Finance and Hellas Finance, rather than Apax or TPG).

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, Japan {{had already}} become an {{important}} ally in the Western defense system as dominated by the US. To foster closer ties with other allies of the US, Hayashi paid several visits <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> countries. In particular, he paid a visit to the United Kingdom (UK) under the invitation of the British government from 5 to 16 May 1957, during which he visited the British Armed Forces and their facilities in London and other places. It was the first formal visit of a senior Japanese general officer to the UK since 1937, when Lieutenant-General Masaharu Homma attended the coronation ceremony of King George VI. After visiting the UK, Hayashi arrived at Bonn, West Germany on 21 May 1957. On the following day, he met Franz Josef Strauss, Federal Minister of Defense, and Generalleutnant Adolf Heusinger, Inspector General of the Bundeswehr. It was the first post-war meeting between military chiefs of Japan and Germany and they achieved productive agreements on building a military exchange mechanism. On 14 and 15 November 1959, Hayashi attended a multinational military conference as hosted by Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander of the US Pacific Command, at Baguio, the Philippines. During his stay, he met Lieutenant-General Manuel F. Cabal, Chief of Staff of the Philippines, General Peng Meng-chi, Chief of the General Staff of the Republic of China, as well as other military chiefs from member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization with a view to fostering stronger military ties with countries in the Western Pacific Region.|$|E

500|$|Although {{percussion}} {{instruments were}} generally rather unimportant in ancient Greek music, two exceptions were in dance music and ritual music of orgiastic cults.

The cult rituals required more exciting noises, {{such as those}} produced by drums, cymbals, jingles, and the rhombos (bull-roarer), which produced a demonic roaring noise particularly important to the ceremonies of the priests of Cybele.
