5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> from a seaborne raid, {{it was believed}} that a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> to destroy the Würzburg radar set. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of <b>the</b> <b>installation,</b> seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E

5|$|Installation 03, also {{referred}} to as Gamma Halo, appears in Halo 4. It is monitored by 049 Abject Testament and is located in the Khaphrae system, orbiting a damaged planet.

It is here that UNSC scientists are conducting experiments on the Forerunner artifact called the Composer, which has the ability to convert biological forms, specifically humans, into AIs. After the game's antagonist, the Didact, activates the device, the UNSC base is left uninhabited.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the coordination of inventory control in divergent multiechelon inventory systems under periodic review and decentralized control. All <b>the</b> <b>installations</b> track echelon inventories. Under decentralized control <b>the</b> <b>installations</b> will decide upon replenishment policies that minimize their individual inventory costs. In general these policies do not coincide with the optimal policies of the system under centralized control. Hence, the total cost under decentralized control is larger than under centralized control. To remove this cost inefficiency, a simple coordination mechanism is presented that is initiated by <b>the</b> most downstream <b>installations.</b> <b>The</b> upstream <b>installation</b> increases its base stock level while <b>the</b> downstream <b>installation</b> compensates <b>the</b> upstream one for increased costs and provides it with additional side payments. We show that this mechanism coordinates the system; the global optimal policy of the system is the unique Nash equilibrium of the corresponding strategic game. Furthermore, the mechanism results in a fair allocation of <b>the</b> costs; all <b>installations</b> enjoy cost savings...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to issues}} of copyright, this is a {{preliminary}} version of a paper in Proceedings of NordiCHI 2006. Experience Design is an emergent field of study, and various approaches to the field abound. In this paper, we take a pragmatic approach to identifying key aspects of an experience design process, by reporting on a project involving the design of experience-oriented applications of interactive technologies for knowledge dissemination and marketing, in cooperation with public institutions and businesses. We argue that collaborative formulation of core design intentions and values is a valuable instrument in guiding experience design processes, and present three cases from this project, two of which resulted in interactive <b>installations.</b> <b>The</b> case <b>installations</b> range from walk-up-and-use consoles, to immersive, responsive, environments based on bodily interaction. We compare <b>the</b> <b>installations,</b> and discuss <b>the</b> interrelations between the resulting interfaces and the intentions for creating <b>the</b> <b>installations,</b> <b>the</b> core values established to guide the design process and the intended use contexts. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>installations</b> present {{a broad spectrum of}} experience design installations that can assist designers in understanding the relations between core values, intentions, use context and interface in the design of experience-oriented interactive installations...|$|R
