[...] The department received approval to move forward with Graffham on 10 February 1944.

500|$|In the 2000s, Blancornelas {{wanted to}} remove bylines from Zetas most {{dangerous}} stories, but was persuaded not to by reporter Francisco Ortiz, who wished his {{to continue to}} run atop his stories on organized crime. In 2005, Ortiz {{was shot to death}} in front of his children, and Blancornelas began his no-byline policy. In the days after Ortiz's death, he stated, [...] "I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price has been too high. I would have liked to retire a long time ago ...

500|$|After {{returning}} to her cage, Kate and Sawyer have an argument, and she climbs out of her cage and breaks open Sawyer's, saying {{if he does not}} want Jack to save his life, he is going to save his own. Sawyer then tells her that they cannot run because they are on another island, something he did not tell her [...] "because I wanted you <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had a damn chance." [...] Kate and Sawyer then have sex, unknowingly {{in full view of the}} cameras. At the Hydra station, Jack finds his door unlocked and unguarded, and outside reaches a surveillance room, where he sees Kate and Sawyer cuddling together on a monitor. Ben appears behind him, and after a brief exchange Jack decides to do the surgery, but wants Ben to keep his promise to let Jack off the island.|$|E

500|$|Mills {{returned}} to management with Conference Premier club Gateshead, signing a one-year rolling contract on 3 September 2013 to replace Anth Smith who resigned in August. At the time Gateshead were 19th in the table, one point above the relegation zone. His first match was a 2–1 home win over Hereford United on 7 September 2013, and both goals were scored by Josh Walker. This {{was the first}} time Mills had won his opening match as manager at a new club. Mills was named the Conference Premier Manager of the Month for October 2013 after Gateshead won all five matches that month, conceding only one goal. Gateshead's form continued to improve and by mid January 2014 they had moved into a play-off place; Mills commented in February that [...] "When I came in, I wanted everyone here <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could win promotion – I think they're starting to now".|$|E
500|$|Barker wrote {{much of the}} show's material, roughly three-quarters, again {{under the}} name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily {{involved}} with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look." [...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune." [...] They took turns to play the parts which had the [...] "good lines". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: [...] "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers." ...|$|E

50|$|The storyline was an {{experiment}} to gauge {{an attempt to}} restore the late Jim Davis' character to the show, after efforts to recast proved futile after no suitable actor could be found to replace Davis. Ultimately, viewer reaction was mixed, but not favorable, as Miss Ellie had found happiness with her remarriage to Clayton Farlow, and that actor Steve Forrest, then at 61, was 16 years younger than his predecessor. Producers finally yielded to viewers and ended the storyline, leaving Jock dead for good {{by the end of}} the tenth season. On the other hand, the resolution to the storyline was vague enough so that there was nothing concrete to contradict anyone who wished <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>Wes</b> was Jock, as despite Miss Ellie claiming <b>that</b> <b>Wes</b> had told her that he wasn't Jock, Wes saying this to Miss Ellie was never televised to viewers.|$|R

Hearst had claimed that Montague had dismissed the murder at the time saying, [...] "She was a bourgeois pig anyway. Her husband is a doctor." [...] In court, Montague denied having said this and added, [...] "I do not want [...] <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ever considered her life insignificant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{decided to}} stay and hold Khartoum despite the orders of the Gladstone {{government}} to merely report about the best means of supervising the evacuation of the Sudan. Powers who acted as Gordon's unofficial press attaché wrote in The Times: [...] "We are daily expecting British troops. We cannot bring ourselves <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are to be abandoned". In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. I know if I was chief I would never employ myself for I am incorrigible".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, NOM stated that the organization has a diverse base of support which includes people of [...] "every color, creed and background" [...] {{and that it has}} [...] "worked with prominent African-American and Hispanic leaders, including Dr. Alveda C. King, Bishop George McKinney of the COGIC Church, Bishop Harry Jackson and the New York State Senator Reverend Rubén Díaz Sr." [...] Gallagher, who was president of the organization {{at the time of the}} documents, said that their language [...] "makes us sound way too big for our britches", while Brown, president at the time the controversy arose, wrote that the language was [...] "inapt", stating that [...] "it would be enormously arrogant for anyone at NOM <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can make or provoke African-American or Latino leaders do anything".|$|E

He {{came to the conclusion that}} the conscious mind must survive after death.

2500|$|On an April 13, 2012, {{appearance}} on Stossel, Palin {{explained that she}} disagreed with host John Stossel {{on the subject of}} drug legalization but reiterated her belief that the government should better prioritize drug laws: [...] "You take even more of a stronger libertarian view than I do on some of those issues, like the War on Drugs. I happen <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need to continue to do all that we can to discourage drug use, especially with our youth. I would like to see, though, law enforcement prioritize its time and resources and not go out and bust a guy in his house, maybe smoking a joint, who's not doing anybody else any harm, and, in the meantime, go out and find the bad guys and you know, try to help keep society safe that way. Just prioritize; use common sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{performing}} another set, Riot Control, at Hull's Gondola Club, {{the premises}} was raided by police and closed soon after; most local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them. COUM {{drew up a}} petition to gain support for the group, attaining a booking at the local Brickhouse; their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. The petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and Nobb with publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped. As they gained coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they supported Hawkwind at St. George's Hall in Bradford in October 1971, where they performed a piece called Edna and the Great Surfers, where they led the crowd in shouting [...] "Off, Off, Off". The following month, the band attracted the interest of music journalist John Peel, who publicly remarked that [...] "ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces me <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need more madmen like them." ...|$|E
2500|$|You Couldn't Make It Up (1995, Heinemann, [...] ) – {{named after}} one of Littlejohn's catchphrases, and {{described}} [...] on the jacket as [...] "a brilliant collection of liberal-skewering wit and wisdom", {{this is a book}} of recollections and opinion pieces on subjects such as political correctness, politicians, corporate [...] "fat cats", the European Union, and the British Royal Family. Anthony Daniels, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said: [...] "...not only does he never mention foreigners in any but a derogatory way – when he is far too intelligent a man really <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have nothing to learn from any of them – but when he writes of the Germans and the Japanese as having taken our cars and electronics industries he is pandering to the kind of stupid, ignorant, sentimental, self-pitying xenophobia which is the root of all fascism, and which is an obstacle to genuine self improvement." [...] The New Statesman wrote: [...] "Not exactly New Statesman territory, but the pick of the best tabloid columnist in Britain is a joy from beginning to end. Hysterically funny, wonderfully politically incorrect, [...] the only writer in Britain to rival the best of the Americans." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
