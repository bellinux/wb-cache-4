50|$|The {{fountain}} {{survived the}} destruction of the second world war with minor damage. Only the middle dog was destroyed but it was reconstructed by Jenő Grantner (its artistic quality is lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>originals).</b> <b>The</b> simplified architectural crowning also created a bit of disharmony in the composition.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{television}} series from 1984, Thomas {{appears to have}} some subtle differences to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> E2 class and to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Thomas from <b>The</b> Railway Series. He is noticeably shorter <b>than</b> <b>the</b> E2 class, and has a set of splashers over his leading driving wheels, which <b>the</b> <b>original</b> engines never had. His water tanks appear closer to the later batch of engines, although they are more squared in shape <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b> Thomas' rear buffer beam is also higher <b>than</b> on <b>the</b> <b>original</b> engines. This caused some concern about Thomas being unable to pull any trains, and this was amended by the story [...] "Thomas Comes to Breakfast".|$|R
50|$|Hyper Meter fills faster <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>original.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{new plan}} was {{put forward by}} West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.|$|E
50|$|Recastings from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Marx molds {{began to}} appear from PlastiMarx out of Mexico, several years after Marx was sold to Quaker Oats in 1972.

50|$|Ludwig reintroduced Vistalite drums in 2001, {{with the}} prime seller being {{a replica of the}} amber five piece kit played by John Bonham. The re-issue shells are {{slightly}} thicker and in the opinions of some warmer sounding and more resonant <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>original</b> shells were at a supposed disadvantange due to a noncontinuous bearing edge. The new versions have a continuous 45 degree edge, making what some feel is a fuller, cleaner tone.|$|R
