5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Rihanna is walking towards a {{dressing}} room mirror while {{preparing for a}} show. This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant. While <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other, Rihanna's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some time, during which Rihanna watches the other tables. One diner writes a note and gives it to a waiter, who passes it to Rihanna, who reads and quickly hides the note as her boyfriend returns to the table. Rihanna starts to sing the song's lyrics while she leaves the dressing room and approaches the stage, where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage. The arena is empty and it appears as though Rihanna is rehearsing.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 New Orleans, Charlie B. Barkin and Itchy Itchiford {{escape from}} the dog pound and return to a casino riverboat on the bayou, {{formerly}} run by Charlie and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface persuades him to leave town with 50% of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later intoxicated and murdered by Carface. He is sent to Heaven, where he meets a whippet angel, who tells him that a gold watch representing his life has stopped. He steals and winds it, returning to Earth, but is told that if he dies again, he will not return to Heaven. After reuniting with Itchy, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie, who {{has the ability to}} talk to animals and gain knowledge of a race's results beforehand, allowing Carface to rig the odds on the rat races and become rich. They rescue her, intending to use her abilities to get revenge on Carface, though Charlie tells her that they plan to give their winnings to the poor and help her find her parents. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her unwashed appearance.|$|E
25|$|Early {{information}} of Charlotte Charke {{can be found}} in the autobiography called a Narrative of The Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke by Charlotte Charke herself, she wrote this and published it as a male author. In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us about her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but she also felt as though she had been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. She was a great shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens dirt. With the absence of her father due to business endeavours and the lack of a mother figure due to constant illnesses, Charlotte became as independent as a young child her age could be, only to put up with nagging maids that watched over her every once and while.|$|E

500|$|Breeds {{acknowledged}} {{that from a}} musical stand point someone who inspires you creatively and acts as your muse, is a special bond. She attributed it to Liam's feelings for Ruby. Ruby and Liam continue to act a support unit for one another. As the scholarship develops <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other about [...] "mature things that surpass a student-teacher relationship." [...] Liam later develops feelings for Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Ruby is seeing Liam slip from her grasp. Breeds said [...] "She sees them flirting {{and she has a}} moment where she realises that she's so in love with this guy and it's kind of now or never. She needs to take action." [...] True to Ruby's persona she does not preconceive her actions and Ruby feels she has to [...] "set the record straight and to give it a really good crack." [...] For Ruby it is a spontaneous, impromptu moment; [...] "She's just totally spilling out with feelings for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abdel Qadir, an Afghan refugee who {{returned}} to Afghanistan, says Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence {{had asked him to}} either receive training to join the Afghan Taliban or for him and his family to leave the country. He explains: [...] "It is a step by step process. First they come, <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. They ask you for the information.... Then gradually they ask you for people they can train and send .... They say, 'Either you do what we say, or you leave the country.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Shermer {{points out}} that human beings {{consistently}} choose to consider non-human objects as human whenever they are allowed the chance, a mistake called the anthropomorphic fallacy: <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> their cars, ascribe desire and intentions to natural forces (e.g., [...] "nature abhors a vacuum"), and worship the sun as a human-like being with intelligence. If the Turing test is applied to religious objects, Shermer argues, then, that inanimate statues, rocks, and places have consistently passed the test throughout history. This human tendency towards anthropomorphism effectively lowers the bar for the Turing test, unless interrogators are specifically trained to avoid it.|$|E

40|$|Stuart Macdonald and Luis Martinez-Uribe have humorously {{described}} themselves as ‘accidental’ data librarians, {{but they have a}} serious message for the research community. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Elspeth Hyams about data sharing and the increasingly important role of librarians in harvesting, curating and facilitating access to datasets...|$|R
2500|$|Even the mightiest of Buddhist kings {{in history}} would kneel before a young sāmaṇera because {{he wore the}} Buddha's mantle, so the parents pay obeisance ( [...] shihko) to their young son, now held on a higher echelon, {{as well as to}} the venerable monks. No {{physical}} display of affection can now be considered appropriate until he leaves the monastery. He gains a new Dharma name ( [...] bwe) in Pali, traditionally based on an astrology-based naming system, such as Shin Ponnya if Thursday-born or Shin Tayza for a Saturday-born.A special form of language for monks will be used by the layfolk when <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. He will be addressed as koyin (...) by everyone including his parents and they in turn addressed by him as daga gyi (...) and dagama gyi (...) [...] Back in the village, celebrations can resume with the promise of a good pwè for the evening, another free show for the entire neighbourhood or village called aung bwè (a show to celebrate success).|$|E
2500|$|... "Where is [...] learned? In life." [...] And how can earnestness be lost? How is it {{related to}} the resolution? Does [...] "love conquer everything?" [...] Kierkegaard thinks, [...] "a true {{conception}} of life and of oneself {{is required for the}} resolution of marriage; but this already implies the second great requirement, which is just like the first: a true conception of God. No one can have a true conception of God without having a corresponding conception of life and oneself, or a true conception of life without a corresponding conception of God, or a true conception of life without a corresponding conception of oneself. But a true conception of God is required; an understanding between God and the happy one is required, and thus a language is required in which <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other. This language is the resolution, the only language in which God will involve himself with a human being." [...] He asks, [...] "Where does a person find guidance if he himself does not work out his own soul's salvation in fear and trembling"? He's writing about the wedding ceremony in this discourse just as he wrote about it in Either/Or and Repetition. Here he presents his own imaginative construction {{of the value of the}} single individual making a decision about marriage in the presence of God. Even though he never married he still knows that [...] "the adult learns only by appropriating and he essentially appropriates the essential only by doing it." ...|$|E
60|$|MARCHBANKS. That is {{what all}} poets do: <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{themselves}} out loud; {{and the world}} overhears them. But it's horribly lonely not to hear someone else talk sometimes.|$|E
6000|$|Rachel {{explained}} {{that most people}} had hitherto been symbols; but that when <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> one <b>they</b> ceased to be symbols, and became--"I could listen to them for ever!"

60|$|<b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{each other}} for a moment, and then they spoke to the woman.

2500|$|Berkowitz's later {{claims are}} {{dismissed}} by many. Breslin rejected his story of Satanic cult accomplices, stating that [...] "when <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> David Berkowitz that night, he recalled everything {{step by step}} by step. The guy has 1,000 percent recall and that's it. He's the guy and there's nothing else to look at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{good little}} girls, no run after sailors--no go where they go; they harm you. Where they come from, no good people talk to 'em--just like dogs. Here, <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Pomaree, and drink arva with great Poofai.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' she answered. 'I am not! I can't be. I am no such thing. Why should I be {{penitent}}, and all {{the world}} go free? <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me of my penitence. Who's penitent for the wrongs {{that have been done}} to me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know. I {{think it}} is their spirits that talk, telling me stories which {{happened}} before I was born and that shall happen after I am dead, yes, and after {{they seem to be}} dead. Now be silent--I say that <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me--it is enough." ...|$|E
60|$|Alicia {{sat down}} and he beside her, {{and when he had}} put his arms about her, he kissed her face and lips.

60|$|And <b>they</b> have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> us--but not prettily, not at all--rather rude {{we should}} call it.|$|R
50|$|In July 1939, a {{group of}} young {{students}} from Colegio Nacional Bolívar gathered to form an independent sporting club, and shortly afterwards entered a minor tournament under the name 'Independiente'. However, in searching for further guidance, <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Army Captain Galo Molina (a student's relative) and together they formed Macará, naming the team after Ecuador's southern army stronghold.|$|R
60|$|He {{kept her}} hand {{a moment longer}} than he need; {{but he was not}} one of those disgusting people who hold your hand while <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, and whom Cornelia hated. She did not now resent it, though she was {{sensible}} of having to take her hand from him.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing is more amusing than {{to watch}} the efforts of our {{monopolist}} opponents to prove that other forms of property and increment {{are exactly the same}} and are similar in all respects to the unearned increment in land. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us of the increased profits of a doctor or a lawyer from the growth of population in the towns in which they live. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us of the profits of a railway through a greater degree of wealth and activity in the districts through which it runs. They tell us of the profits which are derived from a rise in stocks and shares, and even of those which are sometimes derived from the sale of pictures and works of art, and they ask us--as if it were their only complaint--"Ought not all these other forms to be taxed too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me? I'm stalled o' t' curates, {{and so is}} t' wife. They've no manners. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> poor folk fair as if {{they thought}} they were beneath them. They're allus {{magnifying}} their office. It is a pity but their office could magnify them; but it does nought o' t' soart. I fair hate pride." ...|$|E
50|$|The Soyuz 27 crew then {{encountered}} {{their first}} problem - a balky hatch that opened suddenly and sent Makarov and Dzhanibekov tumbling backwards.

50|$|The International Red Cross visited U.N. POW camps, often unannounced, noting {{prisoner}} hygiene, {{quality of}} medical care, variety of diet and weight gain. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the prisoners {{and asked for}} their comments on conditions, {{as well as providing}} them with copies of the Geneva Convention.

60|$|These unfortunate {{people come}} into rooms {{where there are}} crowds of people about--people that it is most {{important}} that they should see, and owing to not seeing whom they get themselves into fearful trouble, and they never notice any of them. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> somebody opposite, and they can't see a third person that is standing bang {{between the two of}} them.|$|E
60|$|Even {{in actual}} life egotism {{is not without}} its attractions. When people talk to us about others they are usually dull.

60|$|The {{first day}} passed rapidly and the Golden Eagle made good headway. The boys {{spent most of}} the time on deck, amusing {{themselves}} as best <b>they</b> could. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Captain Sanders and his mate, and also visited with Billy Dill. Occasionally they conversed with the four Englishmen, but they noticed that the Britishers were inclined to keep to themselves.|$|R
60|$|And so {{she went}} downstairs, to that horrible cousin of her father's. She seemed so intangible, remote and virginal, that her cousin and Miss Pinnegar both failed to make {{anything}} of her. She answered their questions simply, but did not <b>talk.</b> <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> each other. And at last the cousin went away, with a profound dislike of Miss Alvina.|$|R
60|$|Her freedom did {{not find}} the ladies off their guard anywhere. At all the houses there was a skurrying of feet and a {{flashing}} of skirts {{out of the room}} or up the stairs, and there was an interval for a thorough study of the features of the room before the hostess came in, with the effect of coming in just as she was. She had naturally always made some change in her dress, and Annie felt that she had not really liked being run in upon. Everywhere <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her about the theatricals; and <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> across her <b>to</b> Mrs. Munger, about one another, pretty freely.|$|R
