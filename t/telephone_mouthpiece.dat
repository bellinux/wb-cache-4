5000|$|Johnny tells Frank that Ralph {{would have}} gotten his job back in two weeks, while Sally used to be Joe Surlov's girlfriend and she got mixed up in penny-ante bunko scams. Frank finds Surlov working at [...] "one of those all night wicker places." [...] Surlov, who has gone clean, leads Frank to Dr. Zubatski, the {{orthodontist}} who treated Sally. Visiting Dr. Zubatski's office, Frank learns that Sally was chronically in arrears with her payments to Zubatski, but that she paid him in full {{the day after the}} credit union holdup. Setting up the final confrontation, Frank calls Sally, claiming that he is Zubatski (perfectly imitating his voice merely by placing a handkerchief over the <b>telephone</b> <b>mouthpiece),</b> and threatens her with blackmail in order to arrange a clandestine meeting. As Frank is leaving for the meeting, Ed warns that Sally has already killed two men, so he'd better watch his step. Entering the hallway, Frank immediately steps on something that flips him over by his feet, and we see his silhouette dangling upside down through the frosted glass window.|$|E

Self-conscious in his silk hat against the unemployment, {{he waited for the}} others in front of the Hollywood Theatre and watched the evening parade: obscure replicas of bright, {{particular}} picture stars, spavined men in polo coats…" [...] Stella appears, stunning in a sparkling ice-blue dress; Miles had decided to fly to the game after all, and she's just got a telegram to say he's starting back. Afterwards — paranoid that the crazily jealous Miles might be watching her in secret — she invites Joel home. He goes, flirts with her, but is confused — [...] "I have a strange feeling that I'm a sort of pawn in a spite game you're playing against Miles" [...] — she continues to get emotionally blackmailing [...] "I love you" [...] telegrams from Miles — it is implied that Joel and Stella have sex. He is preparing to go — the phone rings with another telegram and Stella answers — the clock strikes midnight as she holds the receiver to her ear, and she falls senseless to the floor — [...] "The <b>telephone</b> <b>mouthpiece</b> was still grinding and he put it to his ear. '—the plane fell just this side of Kansas City. The body of Miles Calman has been identified and—' He hung up the receiver." ...|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Cutler was {{drumming}} for Henry Cow in 1971, {{he had become}} a perfectly competent, albeit unconventional, drummer. The nature of Henry Cow was to experiment and explore and it was here that Cutler developed and refined his drumming techniques. It was also here that he started to electrify his drum kit. He began by attaching old <b>telephone</b> <b>mouthpieces</b> to drums and cymbals, and connecting them to an amplifier and a reverb unit. He later added a small mixer for four independent inputs. The effect was very basic: a few low-grade inputs with only equalisation and reverberation to manipulate.|$|R

5000|$|A {{telephone}} hook or switchhook is {{an electrical}} switch which indicates {{when the phone}} is hung up, often with a lever or magnetic button inside the cradle or base where a telephone handset resides. It {{takes its name from}} old wooden wall telephones and candlestick <b>telephones,</b> where the <b>mouthpiece</b> was mounted on the telephone box and, due to sidetone considerations, the receiver was separate, on a cable. When the telephone was not in use, the receiver was hung on a spring-loaded hook; its weight would cause the hook to swing down and open an electrical contact, disconnecting something, but not the telephone from the line or the phone could not ring. When the handset is on the cradle, the telephone is said to be [...] "on-hook", or ready for a call. When the handset is off the cradle, the telephone is said to be [...] "off-hook", or unable to receive any (further) calls.|$|R
