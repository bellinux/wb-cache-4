40|$|In {{electrical}} engineering terminal connectors {{are commonly used}} for connecting and releasing electrical conductors. They are sophisticated mass products sufficient for high- and low power transmission or transmitting information. There are various applications for wiring in cars, control- or house installations and electrical power supply systems. Depending on the electrical current to be transmitted and consequently the wire diameter there are several approaches to realize a durable and safe mechanical connection between the conductors. The electrical contact resistance of such systems {{is defined by the}} constriction- and the film resistance. The constriction resistance heavily depends on the contact or load force. If the connection becomes loose, this force decreases or even disappears, which results in an extensive raise of the temperature in the contact area. The current density is locally increasing on certain connection points. The raised temperature may lead to unwanted operational states or even fire. There are a few mechanical solutions to realize a constant or re-adjusting contact force. However, these approaches are mechanically complex and hence cost intensive. In this paper we present the development and experimental investigation of a self-adjusting <b>terminal</b> <b>connector</b> based on shape-memory alloys (SMA) which is far less complex than currently known mechanical solutions. The compensation of the decreasing contact force is realized by a precompressed SMA cylinder, which is located in a drill hole {{at the bottom of the}} terminal connector’s screw. Under normal conditions the terminal works similar to a conventional screw connector. In case of decreasing contact forces, the increasing contact resistance results in a rising temperature. As soon as the austenite start temperature is reached the SMA cylinder starts to expand and resets the contact force. As a result the system cools down and the SMA cylinder keeps a desired contact force. In this paper we present the general design of such a system and ist limitations. Measurement data of the SMA cylinder and the active <b>terminal</b> <b>connector</b> will further show the proof of the concept...|$|E

40|$|A {{high pulse}} and average power low-induction load with a {{built-in}} divider is described in this report. The load has a nominal resistance of 25 Ohm and is designed to operate with a repetition rate of up to 50 Hz at a pulse duration (FWHM) of 100 ns, a rise/fall time of 50 ns and pulse amplitude of up to 50 kV. In this mode the dissipated energy is equal to about 10 J per pulse and average power is up to 500 W. At such a short pulse mode there is practically no heat removing from the load resistant layer during one pulse. Therefore the absorbing resistor should have a large heat capacity of the conducting layer. To fit this condition the resistor is realized as a package of resistive rings connected in series, a number of insulating spacers and two <b>terminal</b> <b>connectors.</b> This construction is placed in a cylindrical insulating tube connected to a water-cooling system.

40|$|Due to the {{important}} {{increase of the}} power of electrical transmission and distribution grids expected for the following years, especially in developing countries such as Kenya, Brazil, Philippines or Mexico among others, that have planes of generating energy from clean sources far away from the centres of consumption [1] it becomes a matter of special importance adapting and developing new substation connectors’ testing methods according to the power and temperature regimes at which they are expected to work. The international normative frame of substation connectors established both by the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) [2] and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) [3] sets standardized tests for the evaluation of high voltage connectors. These tests are routinely done within the quality plans of the manufacturers. At the moment, testing of substation connectors –and in general switchgear and fittings- is time demanding and costly due to the energy consumed by such tests. The expectations for the following years are that the power consumption of these tests will not do nothing but grow due to expected increase of power of worldwide overhead lines. For instance, today temperature rise tests in substation connectors involve power ranges up to 100 kVA, which are applied in cycles that can last several weeks. These tests are only feasible in few laboratories and at a very high cost: temporary, monetary, energetic and environmental. For this reason, following the line of other technologies such as aeronautics, naval engineering, or automotive as well as other studies done in the field of electrical engineering specially related to the corona effect [4], this study proposes to develop a reduced scale test system to perform temperature rise tests for substation connectors. Both, a theoretical framework based on analytical formulas, finite element method (FEM) simulations and experimental data has been developed to conduct reduced scale temperature rise tests and to set the conditions at which they provide comparable results to those attained in the original scale tests. Firstly, two circular loops (original and reduced scale loops) composed of a power conductor and two <b>terminal</b> <b>connectors</b> were analysed. The aim of this first study was to determine in an easy and trustful way the voltage and current values to be applied in experimental reduced scale tests to achieve the same steady-state temperature as in the original scale temperature rise test. The scale relationship between tests was set in 1 : 1. 8, although the method proposed in this study can deal with any other scale factor. This study was useful {{in order to have a}} first sight of the final results of the procedure using substation connectors. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|In battery applications, every {{electrical}} connection of battery cells {{is important because}} it influences functionality, efficiency, and safety. Increased contact resistances generate more heat at the affected terminals and if contact resistances of parallel-connected battery cells differ the current divides unequally. Amongst different techniques, detachable connections are easy to handle and have advantages for service, repair and recycling. Usually, detachable {{electrical connection}}s are based on the functional principle of press contacts. So, press contacts are frequently used for consumer batteries in electronic devices, for pouch battery cells in scientific tests, and for large battery cells with screw connections. This paper focusses on the electrical contact resistance of press contacts for battery cells. A novel measuring method to assess the contact resistance itself is presented. Common <b>terminal</b> and <b>connector</b> metals for battery cells and the dependence of their contact resistances on the contact pressure, surface roughness, and contact area are investigated and compared with welding techniques. Only if these dependencies are considered, contact resistances as low as for welded connections are achieved. Furthermore, due to its hard passivating Al 203 surface film, aluminum contacts need a certain surface roughness. The obtained results can serve for modeling and development of battery assemblies...|$|R
40|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{environment of the}} automotive application makes the semi-permanent connector susceptible to intermittent high contact resistance which eventually leads to failure.

40|$|Aging {{analyses}} were performed on solder joints from two radar units: (1) a laboratory, N 57 tube-type radar unit and (2) a field-returned, B 61 - 0, tube-type radar unit. The cumulative temperature environments experienced by the units during aging were calculated from the intermetallic compound layer thickness and the mean Pb-rich phase particle size metrics for solder joints in the units, assuming an aging time of 35 years for both radars. Baseline aging metrics were obtained from a laboratory test vehicle assembled at AS/FM and T; the aging kinetics of both metrics were calculated from isothermal aging experiments. The N 57 radar unit interconnect board solder joints exhibited very little aging. The eyelet solder joints did show cracking that most likely occurred {{at the time of}} assembly. The eyelet, SA 1126 connector solder joints, showed some delamination between the Cu pad and underlying laminate. The B 61 field-returned radar solder joints showed a nominal degree of aging. Cracking of the eyelet solder joints was observed. The Pb-rich phase particle measurements indicated additional aging of the interconnects as a result of residual stresses. Cracking of the <b>terminal</b> pole <b>connector,</b> pin-to-pin solder joint was observed; but it was not believed to jeopardize the electrical functionality of the interconnect. Extending the stockpile lifetime of the B 61 tube-type radar by an additional 20 years would not be impacted by the reliability of the solder joints with respect to further growth of the intermetallic compound layer. Additional coarsening of the Pb-rich phase will increase the joints' sensitivity to thermomechanical fatigue...|$|R

The TLK 2701 supports an effective serial interface speed of 1. 6 Gbps to 2. 7 Gbps, providing up to 2. 16 Gbps of data bandwidth. The primary application of this chip is to provide very high-speed I/O data channels for point-to-point baseband data transmission over controlled impedance media of approximately 50 Ω. The transmission media can be printed-circuit board, copper cables, or fiber-optic cable. The maximum rate and distance of data transfer is dependent upon the attenuation characteristics of the media and the noise coupling to the environment. This device can also be used to replace parallel data transmission architectures by providing a reduction in the number of traces, <b>connector</b> <b>terminals,</b> and transmit/receive terminals. Parallel data loaded into the transmitter is delivered to the receiver over a serial channel, which can be a coaxial copper cable, a controlled impedance backplane, or an optical link.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The main aim of {{this study}} is the {{modelling}} of the interaction of on-chip components with their electromagnetic environment. Design/methodology/approach – The integrated circuit is decomposed in passive and active components interconnected by means of <b>terminals</b> and <b>connectors</b> which represent intentional and parasitic couplings of a capacitive and inductive nature. Reduced order models are extracted independently for each component. Findings – The paper shows that one of the main theoretical problems encountered in the modelling of RF components is the difficulty to define a unique terminal voltage, independent of the integration path (this independence being a condition to allow the connection of the component in an electric circuit, where the voltage does not depend of the path shape). The concept of an electromagnetic circuit element that allows the interconnection between IC models is proposed as a solution for this drawback. The system is described either with EM field models, or by electric/magnetic circuits. By using the new concept of hooks, the EM interaction is described effectively with a reduced number of quantities. Research limitations/implications – Since hooks have a virtual character, their identification is the result of an optimization procedure. By increasing their number the model accuracy is improved as also is the computational effort. The optimal automatic identification of electric and magnetic hooks is the subject of further research. Currently, the hooks are placed manually. Practical implications – The modelling of IC components with hooks is part of a new methodology that takes a layout description of typical RF functional blocks that will operate at RF frequencies up to 60 ?GHz and transform them into sufficiently accurate, reliable electrical simulation models, taking EM coupling and variability into account. This will decrease extra design iterations, over-dimensioning or complete failures in the design cycle of RF-IC. Originality/value – For the first time, the concept of magnetic terminals is used to describe interactions in RF integrated circuits. These EM 2 ̆ 2 hooks 2 ̆ 2 are defined in mathematical terms, as proper boundary conditions. The concept of hooks is also new. The proposed modeling methodology for EM coupling is also new.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{vibration}} of contacts is the main cause of contact degradation by the so called fretting corrosion phenomena. In fact the oxidation process of particles generated by mechanical wear produce the increase of contact resistance frequently reported in the literature. The main objective of this work is to examine conjointly the wear amount and electrical behaviour of <b>connector</b> <b>terminals</b> under vibration stress. The spring lamellas of an automotive connector are submitted to high number of vibration (103 to 107 cycles) whereas the pin is firmly attached to a fixed support. High frequency (100 Hz) and low frequency (1 Hz) oscillation with two amplitudes of 50 ?m and 250 ?m are used. The contact is made with copper alloy and coated with 2 ?m of thickness and made in tin, silver or gold. The contact resistance is measured with a current source (Im = 1 mA) with a voltage limit of Vcc of 20 mV. Furthermore a new technique for characterising the subsequent wear is carried out. So, the dimensions of the resultant wear track are evaluated by profilometer (10 nm of resolution) while the removed mass in the track are evaluated by weight (± 1 ?g). The main results show that a low level of wear observed during the earlier stage of fretting may corresponds to the neglected contact resistance increase. However after this initiating period the coating is removed and as contact resistance increased the wear takes place in the substrate. Finally the effects of motion parameters, test duration and different coatings were studied...|$|R
