50|$|Mechanical {{models that}} treat accretionary {{complexes}} as critically <b>tapered</b> <b>wedges</b> of sediment demonstrate that pore pressure controls their taper angle by modifying basal and internal shear strength. Results from some {{studies show that}} pore pressure in accretionary wedges {{can be viewed as}} a dynamically maintained response to factors which drive pore pressure (source terms) and those that limit flow (permeability and drainage path length). Sediment permeability and incoming sediment thickness are the most important factors, whereas fault permeability and the partitioning of sediment have a small effect. In one such study, it was found that as sediment permeability is increased, pore pressure decreases from near-lithostatic to hydrostatic values and allows stable taper angles to increase from ∼2.5° to 8°-12.5°. With increased sediment thickness (from 100 - 8000 m), increased pore pressure drives a decrease in stable taper angle from 8.4°-12.5° to <2.5-5°. In general, low-permeability and thick incoming sediment sustain high pore pressures consistent with shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high-permeability and thin incoming sediment should result in steep geometry. Active margins characterized by a significant proportion of fine-grained sediment within the incoming section, such as northern Antilles and eastern Nankai, exhibit thin taper angles, whereas those characterized by a higher proportion of sandy turbidites, such as Cascadia, Chile, and Mexico, have steep taper angles. Observations from active margins also indicate a strong trend of decreasing taper angle (from >15° to <4°) with increased sediment thickness (from <1 to 7 km).|$|E

The K–N joint is composed of a triangular-sectioned beam and wedges in combination with bolts. Its resistive mechanism utilises the embedment strength of timber and the pre-stress in association with friction. In addition, elastic energy deposited in the bolt as storage fills the gap as it is deformed during the embedment. With the aim of optimising both mechanically and physically, several alterations were tested in terms of shape (taper angle) and of combining densified veneer wood (DVW) with the joint members. A cyclic loading test of the cross joints was made to examine their structural behaviour. The use of less <b>tapered</b> <b>wedges</b> showed higher stiffness and strength, but the beam beneath was undesirably embedded. Different combinations of reinforcement with densified veneer wood showed that the use of the wedges alone provided high optimisation, and an increase in bolt axial force. The successful test results observed in the alteration using the densified veneer wood are expressed using the ‘analytical K–N joint diagram', an analytical method modified from a conventional joint diagram used in mechanical engineering, which showed itself to be an applicable method to predict the trend of the altered K–N joint. The use of the new tapered angle and densified veneer wood for optimisation, and the performance predictions using the analytical K–N joint diagram, will need further precise investigations but their great benefits are potentially promising...|$|E

40|$|Analogue and {{finite element}} {{numerical}} models with frictional and viscous properties {{are used to}} model thrust wedge development. Comparison between model types yields valuable information about analogue model evolution, scaling laws and the relative strengths and limitations of the techniques. Both model types show a marked contrast in structural style between ‘frictional-viscous domains’ underlain by a thin viscous layer and purely ‘frictional domains’. Closely spaced thrusts form a narrow and highly asymmetric fold-and-thrust belt in the frictional domain, characterized by in-sequence propagation of forward thrusts. In contrast, the frictional-viscous domain shows a wide and low <b>taper</b> <b>wedge</b> and a thrust belt with a more symmetrical vergence, with both forward and back thrusts. The frictional-viscous domain numerical models show that the viscous layer initially simple shears as deformation propagates along it, while localized deformation resulting {{in the formation of}} a pop-up structure occurs in the overlying frictional layers. In both domains, thrust shear zones in the numerical model are generally steeper than the equivalent faults in the analogue model, because the finite element code uses a non-associated plasticity flow law. Nevertheless, the qualitative agreement between analogue and numerical models is encouraging. It shows that the continuum approximation used in numerical models can be used to model frictional materials, such as sand, provided caution is taken to properly scale the experiments, and some of the limitations are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The lowest {{structural}} and stratigraphic {{levels of the}} Yukon-Tanana terrane and the structurally underlying parautochthonous North American margin rocks were metamorphosed at similar conditions (7. 5 – 9 kbar; 600 – 680 °C) and share a common style of deformation, characterized by the transposition of lithologic contacts and primary compositional layering into a regional ductile foliation (ST) {{with at least one}} generation of intrafolial isoclinal folds. Equilibrium assemblage modeling and in situ U-Th-Pb SHRIMP dating of monazite are used to place quantitative constraints on the conditions and timing of deformation, metamorphism and subsequent decompression. These data reveal that these fabrics, and the associated metamorphism, did not develop during a single tectono-metamorphic event. Rather, ductile deformation and high-grade metamorphism developed diachronously. Rocks deformed and metamorphosed in the Permo-Triassic and Early Jurassic were exhumed in the Early Jurassic, while rocks to the northeast in the Finlayson domain were buried, heated and ductiley deformed at mid-crustal levels (~ 25 km depth) from the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (c. 169 – 142 Ma). Metamorphism continued at an even deeper crustal level (~ 30 km depth, as recorded in the Australia Mountain domain), propagating downward into the parautochthonous North American crust in the Early Cretaceous (c. 146 – 118 Ma). Together, these data reveal a spatial and temporal pattern of structurally downward younging deformation and metamorphism that corresponds with the foreland-directed growth of a critically <b>tapered</b> orogenic <b>wedge.</b> In this model, rocks in front of the wedge are episodically underthrust downward into a distributed, high-grade transposition shear zone at 25 to 30 kilometres depth near the base of the overriding wedge.

40|$|Himalayan domes {{in south}} central Tibet, {{consists}} of a multiphase granite core surrounded by a deformed metasedimentary carapace. The granitic core records general non‐coaxial shear with a top‐to‐the‐south sense shear component. The contact between the core and the carapace is a shear zone, characterized by general non‐coaxial shear with a top‐to‐the‐north shear sense, interpreted to be the northern continua-tion of the South Tibetan detachment system (STDS). The shear zone contains lenses of leucogranite dated at 35. 4 Ma. This is interpreted to reflect Eocene crustal thickening, coeval with the earliest shortening event recorded in the carapace. The main phase of the Changgo granite crystallized at 23. 5 Ma, while unde-formed aplite dikes, the youngest phase observed in the granite, were intruded at 22. 1 Ma. Aplite dikes crosscut themain deformation fabric within the Changgo granite; therefore, that deformation and associated south directed shearingmust have ended between 23. 5 Ma and 22. 1 Ma. The dikes are strained within the STDS, indicating that final displacement along the STDS must post‐date 22 Ma, yet be older than 18. 4 Ma, the cooling age of muscovite in the shear zone.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers, {{each of which}} complements the regional understanding of the Ceduna Delta System, offshore South Australia. Deltas commonly form linked systems of extension, on the delta top, and compression, in the delta toe. This link is promoted {{by the presence of}} a detachment layer of more ductile sediments {{at the base of the}} delta, which mechanically decouples deltaic sediments from those beneath it. These systems are often explained using Critical <b>Taper</b> <b>Wedge</b> mechanics, which is commonly applied to understand the rock strength properties and the role of pore fluid pressure at the base of the wedge (within the detachment layer) and within the wedge, in these linked systems of extension and compression. To better understand the effect of basal pore fluid pressure on delta—deepwater fold thrust belt systems, I present an in-depth application of Critical <b>Taper</b> <b>Wedge</b> mechanics to the data-rich deepwater Niger Delta Toe in West Africa, a modern day analogue for the ancient Ceduna Sub-basin (Paper 1). This application involved developing a new technique to measure key variables from seismic reflection data in the Niger Delta Toe and input them into a script to calculate the basal pore fluid pressure required to form the observed present-day geometries. With this new approach and increased understanding of the role of basal pore fluid pressure on delta wedge geometry it was possible to better understand how detachment variables control distribution of the lobes that comprise the Cretaceous-age Ceduna Delta. Regional structural mapping of the Ceduna Delta resulted in separation of the delta lobes based on tectonic style and also examining the linkages between the systems, explaining the unique stacking of the delta tops while each system maintained independent deepwater fold-thrust belts (Paper 2). Furthermore, detailed 3 D seismic reflection data is interpreted to investigate inversion structures and potential for fault reactivation in the basin (Paper 3). The boundary element method geomechanical code Poly 3 D© was used to investigate delta-top fault reactivation potential from a 3 D seismic derived fault network along with the present day stress determined from petroleum wells. Results demonstrate a moderate to high probability for contemporary reactivation of faults under a strike-slip to strike-slip-normal fault stress regime (Paper 3). In addition, detrital zircon analysis, apatite fission track analysis and zircon fission track analysis were undertaken to investigate the potential source(s) for the deltaic sediment input in the Ceduna Delta system (Paper 4). Over 1500 detrital zircon and apatite grains were analysed from petroleum wells and outcrop samples located onshore and offshore South Australia. The results indicate approximately 1 - 2 km of Late Cretaceous uplift/exhumation of the proximal arcuate shaped South Australian southern margin provided the source for the Santonian-Maastrichtian delta lobe, mainly from erosion of existing Permian-Cenomanian sedimentary cover. Finally, the last paper presented in this thesis (Paper 5) ties in new 2 D reflection seismic data that was not available when Paper 2 was written, to further examine the geometry of the deepwater fold-thrust belts and the hydrocarbon potential of the Ceduna Sub-basin.

Material was processed by standard preparative techniques for electron microscopy. Serial semithin and ultrathin sections were made over the entire extent of several transitional zones at ages ranging from 2 to 300 days postnatum. Central tissue projections were reconstructed in three dimensions and analysed morphometrically. The morphology of the central tissue projection varies during development. At first, it forms an irregular projection into the anterior portion of the rootlet. It than elongates and {{takes the form of a}} dorsoventrally flattened, distally <b>tapering</b> <b>wedge.</b> By 20 days postnatum it has attained its definitive form.

The latter comprise the third segment. The projection comes to form a substantial proportion of the anterior, proximal and distal surfaces of the dorsal rootlet from an early stage. The mean length of the central tissue projection increases progressively over all intervals studied, except that between 12 and 30 days postnatum, when a reduction in length is associated with reorganisation of the morphology of the projection. Projection length varies considerably between rootlets and is relatively weakly correlated with rootlet cross sectional area.

The upper {{fault the}} Qomolangma Detachment, follows the north slope of Everest from above the ‘Yellow Band’ at c. 8500 m on the Southwest Face down to the Rongbuk glacier. On the south side of Everest this fault places unmetamorphosed Ordovician mudstones and limestones above biotite-grade marbles, calc-silicates and greenschists (Everest series pelites). The lower normal fault, the Lhotse Detachment, places greenschist grade calc-silicates and pelites above sillimanite–K-feldspar-grade gneisses (quartz+biotite+garnet+K-feldspar+plagioclase+sillimanite±cordierite assemblages) formed at temperatures above 650 °C. Abundant sheet intrusions, sills and dykes of leucogranite containing tourmaline+muscovite±biotite±garnet are restricted to the footwall of the Lhotse Detachment. The mid–upper greenschist grade Everest pelites, some 2000 m thick on the SW face of Everest, form a northward <b>tapering</b> <b>wedge</b> bounded by normal faults below and above.

The leucogranite peaks of Ama Dablam, Kangteiga and Tamserku are all part of the same sheet, which, prior to erosion, was probably originally continuous. The main granite emplacement mechanism was by syn-tectonic magma injection by hydraulic fracture propagation during simple shear, along a series of large sills from their source region at depth to the north. Granite emplacement occurred during upper crustal extension along the top of the High Himalayan slab, although final motion on the Lhotse Detachment post-dated granite emplacement.

40|$|International audienceThe 2008 M w 7. 9 Wenchuan {{earthquake}} ruptured an imbricate thrust {{system in}} the Longmen Shan range, which forms the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau. We use seismic reflection data and surface geology to construct geologic cross sections and a three-dimensional (3 D) fault model in the range front. The rupture was complex, with slip on both the steeply dipping Beichuan fault and the more shallowly dipping Pengguan fault, which appear to merge at depth. In contrast, only the Beichuan fault ruptured in the north, with the transition near a lateral fault offset. Thus, the earthquake involved multiple thrust splays and breached a significant segment boundary. To investigate the tectonic setting of the earthquake, we extend our previous measurements of crustal shortening (Hubbard and Shaw, 2009) into {{the interior of the}} range and show that shortening correlates with topography. This suggests that upper-crustal shortening can produce the high topography of the Longmen Shan without calling on other uplift mechanisms. Based on this understanding, we model the thrust belt as a critical <b>taper</b> <b>wedge,</b> to assess what rock and fault strengths are required to explain the topographic slopes within the range front and basin. The low taper within the basin is consistent with a weak detachment (δ f ≈ 0 : 1), while a slightly stronger (δ f ≈ 0 : 3 – 0 : 4) detachment is necessary to explain the higher taper of the range front. This difference may relate to the localization of the detachment within a Triassic evaporite sequence within the basin, while the faults beneath the range front are rooted in Precambrian metasedimentary or igneous rocks. Critical taper theory implies that shortening in the range front where the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake occurred is many times greater than in the basin, consistent with our shortening measurements. We examine the implications of these findings for seismic hazard assessment in the region and in other active mountain belts around the world...|$|R

An alternative model, with repeated glaciotectonic push-from-behind, deforms less proglacial material since the ice, which is doing the pushing, melts back before the deforming sediment can form a critical taper. Structures produced by repeated glaciotectonic push-from-behind are iii generated by seasonal or annual readvance of the glacier margin during a period of overall glacial retreat. Two field areas located within the Ronkonkoma Moraine of Long Island are documented to provide clear examples of glaciotectonic push-from-behind. At the Ranc...|$|R
40|$|A gravity {{survey in}} an area {{involving}} portions of the Quetico and Shebandowan subprovinces of the Superior structural province resulted {{in the establishment of}} 350 new gravity stations in addition to 50 previously established stations. For {{the purposes of this study}} the bedrock was divided into 4 major units including the metavolcanic rocks* metasedimentary rocks, assorted gneissic rocks and a group of intrusive igneous bodies. Based on gravity modeling of these principal units, the following subsurface structure results. The metavolcanic rocks vary in depth extent from 6 km to 12 km and typically occupy a trough-shaped structure flanked by a domical feature of granitoid gneisses to the south. To the north of the metavolcanic unit, the metasedimentary rocks form a basin-like structure of variable depth extent. The contact between these two units is modeled as dipping steeply southward. The Quetico granitoid gneisses to the north of the metasedimentary unit form a southward dipping wedge which extends to depths of 10 km in the model structure profiles. These gneisses are modeled as being underlain by a denser substratum representative of more basic gneiss and amphibolite. The basal surface of this unit is gently convex upward, and the unit as a whole thickens toward the north and dips toward the south in a <b>tapered</b> <b>wedge</b> extending to a depth of 10 km. This unit is inclined slightly from east to west, and is exposed at the present erosion surface in the eastern portion of the study area only. A number of quartz monzonite plutons have been emplaced near the northern portion of the metasedimentary unit and outcrops above the southern most edge of the dense substratum underlying the Quetico gneisses. A tectonic model put forward synthesizes the available information regarding Archean crustal evolution and the data from this study. The proposed model consists of a basin-like structure (Quetico subprovince) which received sedimentary and volcanic debris from a mature volcanoplutonic terrane to the north (Wabigoon subprovince). Additional sedimentation into the basin was provided from the less mature volcanoplutonic terrane to the south (Shebandowan subprovince). Subsequent deformation accompanied by high grade metamorphism resulted in a general upwarping of the basin, producing the structures now observed in this part of the Quetico subprovince...|$|R
25|$|High-heeled {{footwear}} (often abbreviated as {{high heels}} or simply heels) is footwear {{that raises the}} heel of the wearer's foot {{significantly higher than the}} toes. When both the heel and the toes are raised equal amounts, as in a platform shoe, it is technically not considered to be a high heel; however, there are also high-heeled platform shoes. High heels tend to give the aesthetic illusion of longer, more slender legs. High heels come {{in a wide variety of}} styles, and the heels are found in many different shapes, including stiletto, pump (court shoe), block, <b>tapered,</b> blade, and <b>wedge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fan {{house is}} located {{south of the}} headframe. It mostly {{consists}} of a large cylindrical, steel fan housing mounted on concrete plinths. The eastern end of the housing is flared and open; a large multi- bladed fan is visible inside. A smaller, hollow plinth supports {{this end of the}} housing; a smaller fan is visible inside. The west end of the housing becomes square in cross-section and <b>tapers</b> to a <b>wedge</b> shape. A larger concrete plinth supports this end of the housing. A small, open ended corrugated iron structure mounted on top of the housing contains an electric motor.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the characterization of}} integrated micromachined waveguide absorbers in the frequency band of 220 to 325 GHz. <b>Tapered</b> absorber <b>wedges</b> were cut out of four different commercially available semi-rigid absorber ma terials and inserted in a backshorted micromachined waveguide cavity for characterization. The absorption properties of these materials are only specified at 10 GHz, and their absorption behavior above 100 GHz was so far unknown. To study {{the effect of the}} geometry of the absorber wedges, the return loss of different absorber lengths and tapering angles was investigated. The results show that longer and sharper sloped wedges from the material specified with the lowest dielectric constant, but not the highest specified absorption, are superior over other geometries and absorber materials. The best results were achieved for 5 mm long absorbers with a tapering angle of 23 ° in the material RS- 4200 from the supplier Resin Systems, having a return loss of better than 13 dB over the whole frequency range of 220 to 325 GHz. These absorber wedges are intended to be used as matched loads in micromachined waveguide circuits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publication characterizing such micromachined waveguide absorbers.
