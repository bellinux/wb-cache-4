5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the service rooms. The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E
5|$|While a {{stand-up}} comedian, Larry David also {{worked as a}} store clerk, limousine driver, and historian. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, a federally subsidized housing complex in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> Kenny Kramer, {{the inspiration for the}} Cosmo Kramer character in Seinfeld. David then became a writer for and cast member of ABC's Fridays from 1980 to 1982, and a writer for NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) from 1984 to 1985. During his time at SNL, he was able to get only one sketch on the show, which aired at 12:50 AM, the last time slot on the show.|$|E
5|$|In late 1976, Bakshi {{learned that}} John Boorman was {{contracted}} to direct {{an adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, in which J. R. R. Tolkien's three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. Down <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{accounting}} department features Angela Martin, an admitted uptight and hypocritical woman {{who wishes to}} keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as serious as possible; Kevin Malone, a lovable, but dim-witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges himself with gambling and M and Oscar Martinez is intelligent but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and Hispanic heritage made him a favorite target for Michael's unintentional off-color comments. Rounding out the office are the stern salesman Stanley Hudson, who barely stood for Michael's constant references to his Black-American heritage (he also doesn't like {{to take part in}} time wasting meetings and sometimes sleeps in them or works on crossword puzzles); eccentric quality assurance representative Creed Bratton; the kind and caring saleswoman Phyllis Lapin-Vance, who marries Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the office; Andy Bernard is a salesman introduced in season three after the closing of the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin and the merging of the two; the bubbly and talkative customer service representative Kelly Kapoor; the promiscuous alcoholic supply relations representative Meredith Palmer; human resources representative Toby Flenderson, who is admittedly hated by, and often the target of abuse by Michael Scott; warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin; Warehouse dock worker and Pam's ex-fiancé Roy Anderson, who was fired in the third season; and Michael's former love interest and former Vice President for Regional Sales for Dunder Mifflin Jan Levinson (Jan Levinson-Gould until her divorce in season 2).|$|E
5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat at a long table, facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double purlins, and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main rafter is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>from</b> the kitchen and servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E

25|$|They were {{concerned}} that whilst {{the scale of the}} project demanded a monumental building, it should not ape the triumphal classicism of many earlier public buildings. The wide open foyers, with bars and restaurants, were intended to be meeting places for all: there were to be no separate bars for different classes of patron. Because these public spaces were built around the auditorium, they also had the effect of insulating <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>from</b> the noise of the adjacent railway bridge.|$|E

25|$|Entrance for {{visitors}} is at ground floor level via the 19th Century Hall. This double height space is lit from above with a north glazed pyramidal skylight intersected with reinforced concrete beams and a column. On {{the opposite side}} of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the entrance, the ascent to the paintings gallery is via a promenade ramp which affords better views of Rodin's sculptures. The paintings gallery wraps around 19th Century Hall, the ceiling is initially low but is raised to two storeys around the perimeter to display the paintings. There are also balconies at this level that push back into the 19th Century Hall to re-orient the visitor. Le Corbusier designed the paintings gallery to be lit by natural daylight via four lighting troughs, but these are no longer used and the galleries are now artificially lit.|$|E
25|$|Culterham Hall, {{known locally}} {{simply as the}} Village Hall, opened in 1951 and is the centre of {{activity}} in Mawbray today. An amateur dramatics group called the Mawbray Entertainers write, direct, and perform their own pantomime every year during the half-term break in February in Culterham Hall, and the money raised is donated {{to a range of}} local and national charities. The Hall also accommodates many other musical events, especially by performers on the Rural Touring Scheme throughout the year. In addition to these special events, members of the community run a wide range of clubs and activities at <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> <b>from</b> sports like Tai Chi and bowls to dog training classes and a weekly children's club. In addition, the Hall plays host to craft sales several times a year, including in the run-up to Christmas, where local craftspeople sell a range of items.|$|E
25|$|Donna Kozlowski {{played by}} Jillian Armenante: He is Amy's clerk. An {{eccentric}} woman, she {{is from a}} wealthy family, but estranged from them. Donna is a genius (she finishes her law degree in {{one and a half}} years) and socially awkward. She is married to a convicted murderer, Oscar Ray Pant, and becomes roommates with Amy's brother Vincent. While living with him, she has a daughter by Oscar, Ariadne Gray Pant, to whom she gives birth in a plastic pool in Amy's living room. Her mother arrives while Donna is in the pool, but is unable to offer her support and leaves. Maxine ends up getting in the pool with Donna. Later, Oscar confesses to Donna that he is really guilty and she divorces him. Upon passing the bar examination, Amy fires her so she would go to work as a lawyer; she becomes a court-appointed minor counsel for the Hartford Youth Advocates, whose office is across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> Amy's.|$|E

25|$|On 28 July 1710, the Revd Dr Richard Newton was {{admitted}} principal of Hart Hall. Newton was a well-connected, energetic educational reformer. He was appointed principal from 'a very peaceful retirement' as Rector of Sudborough, {{where he was}} personal tutor to two brothers, who were both destined to be prime minister — Thomas Pelham-Holles and Henry Pelham — bringing the younger with him to Hart Hall. He dedicated himself to raising <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>from</b> debt and securing a firmer financial endowment. Newton planned to redesign the Hall around a proper quadrangle, with a tutor, or angler, and students living in each angle, and common buildings along the sides. However, only two buildings in his design were ever built: one angle in the south-east corner of the Old Quadrangle (nowadays known as the Cottage), and his simple stone Chapel {{on the south side}} (consecrated 25 November 1716), which now serves as the College's Library. These buildings were financed entirely from Newton's pocket, to the sum of around £2000 (around £ adjusted for inflation).|$|E
25|$|In the mid-70s, Matuschka began {{pursuing}} a writing career and spent many nights at Elaine's, the Carlyle Hotel, the St. Regis and P.J. Clarke's {{where she met}} and worked {{with a variety of}} writers and artists including: Salvador Dali, Norman Wexler (who wrote Saturday Night Fever in an apartment across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> her flat), gonzo journalist Anthony Haden-Guest, writer, sports publisher and socialite George Plimpton, Michael O'Donoghue (Saturday Night Live), producer Bertrand Castelli, socialites Ted Otis and the Van de Bovenkamps and bestselling author Joseph DiMona. Joe DiMona introduced her to Pine Associates Literary Agency in 1978 and the father/son duo represented her intellectual properties for a brief time. Excerpts of her unpublished memoir were reprinted in three issues of OUI Magazine, a subsidiary of Playboy Magazine, in 1981. One feature included an introduction by Anthony Haden-Guest and a pictorial spread by Jeff Dunas. She received a PEN Writing grant during this time. Since the 80s Matuschka's writings and poetry have appeared in dozens of publications and books worldwide from Glamour Magazine, to Oxford anthologies and academic journals {{on a wide range of}} subjects.|$|E
25|$|For {{more formal}} gatherings {{both before and}} after state events, as well as for {{entertaining}} visiting heads of state and their party, the Large Drawing Room, {{on the south side of}} the Monck Wing, is used. Previously called the Red Salon, the space underwent thorough renovations in 1901, updating it to the Edwardian style that was popular at the time, giving it boiserie panelling formed from plaster mouldings, a layered crown moulding, as well as windows and doors with chambranled montants, the latter openings also equipped with moulded, classical overdoors. On the walls of the drawing room are hung portraits depicting the viceregal consorts of previous governors general. Directly across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the Large Drawing Room is the State Dining Room, which is reserved for state dinners for visiting heads of state with smaller parties, with the table seating a maximum of 42 guests. in 1909, the dining room too was renovated to a similar Edwardian look, but its present day layout did not emerge until the late 1940s, after various subsequent renovations. The sterling silver sets on display in this room are on loan from Buckingham Palace.|$|E
