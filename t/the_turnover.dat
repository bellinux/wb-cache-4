On the first play after <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal. The kick ricocheted {{off one of the}} uprights but through the goal posts, extending the Seminoles' lead to 2317 with 10:13 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> the Eagles' offense {{began work}} at their 46-yard line. Davis {{completed}} a five-yard pass to Robinson, advancing into Tech territory. An incomplete pass followed, but Davis {{was able to}} gain the first down with a pass to Rich Gunnell at the 39-yard line. On the first pass after the first down, Davis and Gunnell connected on a deep pass, but Gunnell fumbled and the ball was recovered {{in the end zone}} by a Virginia Tech defender. The play resulted in a touchback, and Virginia Tech took over on offense at its 20-yard line. Following <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Tech went three and out, punting back to Boston College with 2:11 remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{returned}} the post-score kickoff to their 20-yard line, and Tech's offense began work. Thomas gained {{a first down}} with three consecutive runs, then the Hokies fumbled when a backwards pass from DeShazo fell incomplete. Indiana recovered the ball, and <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> allowed the Hoosiers' offense to start work from the Tech 25-yard line. On Indiana's first play, however, Virginia Tech cornerback Tyronne Drakeford intercepted Paci's pass. Following <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Tech's offense started work at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first down through the air, then DeShazo scrambled for another. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed Tech backward, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Texas {{attempted}} a trick play, but the pass {{by a wide}} receiver was knocked down by the Virginia Tech defense. After an eight-yard gain on a running play, Texas was penalized 10yards for holding. The Longhorns were unable to regain the yardage lost to the penalty and punted to the Hokies. With 2:15 remaining in the opening quarter, Tech fair caught the punt at its 19-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{dominated}} Buffalo statistically in {{the first}} half, gaining 225yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208yardsrushing. Buffalo won <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20points off UConn turnovers {{in the first}} half, but were held scoreless {{in the second half}} when the Huskies stopped turning the ball over.|$|E

5|$|Tech quarterback Sean Glennon's {{first pass}} {{of the new}} possession, long throw downfield, was intercepted by Boston College defender Jamie Silva. The length of the pass meant that Boston College did not have good field {{position}} following <b>the</b> <b>turnover.</b> After earning a quick first down, the Eagles were stopped and forced to punt. With 2:13 remaining before halftime, the Hokies had one more offensive opportunity.|$|E
5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{hopes to}} answer were smashed {{on the first}} play after Georgia's kickoff as Glennon fumbled the snap, losing the ball to Georgia's Quentin Moses. Georgia failed {{to pick up a}} first down {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> but the fumble did turn into three points for the Bulldogs, as kicker Brandon Coutu connected on his third field goal of the day, giving Georgia its first lead since the first quarter, 24–21.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Druckenmiller got Virginia Tech's drive {{started with}} a first-down pass to the Tech 42-yard line. After a short run by Edmonds, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass, setting up a third-and-seven for Virginia Tech's offense. During the third-down play, wide receiver Bryan Still broke free of the Texas defense and caught a 55-yard pass from Druckenmiller for Tech's second offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was successful, and Tech took a 2110 lead with 12:28 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Clemson fielded {{the opening}} kickoff at the two-yard line and {{returned}} it to their 25-yard line, where the Tigers' offense performed the game's first offensive play, a one-yard scramble by Dantzler. A subsequent running play and an incomplete pass caused Clemson to go three-and-out before punting. Clemson punter Jamie Somaini mishandled the ball, however, and Virginia Tech's defense tackled him at the Tigers' 23-yard line. On Tech's first play after <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> quarterback Michael Vick completed a 23-yard pass to Jared Ferguson for a touchdown. The extra point kick by Carter Warley was successful, and Virginia Tech had a 70 lead with 13:23 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{had been}} shaky on defense. ECU ranked 98th in total defense and 115th in passing defense, giving up {{an average of}} 436.42yards per game. Despite that fact, the Pirates did well in <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> battle, gaining 27turnovers while losing just 13–a margin of +14–good enough for ninth in the country. In addition, the ECU defense ranked {{eleventh}} nationally in tackles for loss. Defensive linemen Zack Slate and C.J. Wilson and defensive back Van Eskridge took C–USA All–Conference second team honors.|$|E

In terms of <b>turnover,</b> <b>the</b> naive 1 /N portfolio has <b>the</b> lowest <b>turnover.</b> <b>The</b> two portfolio selection strategies considered {{in this paper}} have relatively low turnover rates with RSMVt the preferred choice. The portfolio rules in selected from literature have a high turnover rate {{as compared to the}} regularized models in this paper. <b>The</b> highest <b>turnover</b> comes from TMN, MV and minVu portfolios leading to smaller Sharpe ratios. We observe that with large turnovers, feasible transaction costs lowers the monetary gains of many selected portfolios strategies in literature, as seen by Sharpe ratio deductions after transaction costs have been considered.|$|R
5|$|In the season's {{penultimate}} game, Maryland lost to Penn State, 48–0. Penn State halfback Lydell Mitchell {{had been}} recruited by Lester and {{originally intended to}} go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead. Lester was bothered by a similar situation with fullback Franco Harris, whose high school coach {{was a friend of}} Lester's. Lester attributed Maryland's football woes to <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings. Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3–7 record.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{kicked off}} to Nevada {{to start the}} second half, and the teams again {{exchanged}} punts twice. Kaepernick sat out the next series due to his sprained ankle. Backup quarterback Nick Graziano took over {{but was unable to}} complete two passes and Nevada punted a third time. In the next series, Turner threw an interception to Nevada safety Jonathan Amaya, who returned it for 33yards to the Maryland 22-yard line, then fumbled. The ball was recovered by Nevada, and Kaepernick capitalized on <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Taua, narrowing Nevada's deficit to 28–21.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{the surface}} have {{revealed}} {{that some of the}} molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from the surface.

One estimate suggests that, given <b>the</b> <b>turnover</b> rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E

5|$|On State's {{first play}} after <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Rix was sacked for a four-yard loss. On the next play, Virginia Tech defender Eric Green jumped {{in front of}} an errant Rix pass and intercepted it. Green {{returned}} the ball to the State 44-yard line, and the Hokies' offense started a drive inside Florida State territory. On the first play of the drive, Tech attempted a reverse pass, but the ball fell incomplete. Two subsequent plays were stopped for no gain, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the game.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play after <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Thomas Jones's 52-yard run moved {{the ball to the}} Colts' 5-yard line.

After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} drive with an {{incomplete}} pass, which {{was followed by}} a short run. On third down, Vick prepared to throw the ball, but he was hit by Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball. Fellow Clemson defender Terry Jolly recovered the loose football and returned it to the Tech 14-yard line before he was tackled. Following <b>the</b> <b>turnover,</b> Dantzler was stopped on a short run then threw two incomplete passes. Rather than again attempt to convert a fourth down, Bowden sent in kicker Aaron Hunt to attempt a 28-yard field goal. The kick soared through the uprights, and Clemson narrowed Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 5:45 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
