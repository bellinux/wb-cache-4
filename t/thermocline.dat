25|$|This empirically derived {{approximation}} equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity {{and the range}} of most ocean depths. Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the <b>thermocline,</b> dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make {{up the rest of the}} ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the <b>thermocline</b> tends to be bent, or refracted, through the <b>thermocline.</b> The <b>thermocline</b> may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the <b>thermocline.</b> Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law.|$|E
25|$|The sonar hydrophones may be towed {{behind the}} ship or {{submarine}} {{in order to}} reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself. Towed units also combat the <b>thermocline,</b> as the unit may be towed above or below the <b>thermocline.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{halocline}} often {{coincides with}} the <b>thermocline,</b> and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline.|$|E

25|$|Factors {{affecting}} visibility include: {{particles in}} the water (turbidity), salinity gradients (haloclines), temperature gradients (<b>thermoclines)</b> and dissolved organic matter.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the bulk}} of the {{technical}} literature addresses surface seiches, which are readily observed, seiches are also observed beneath the lake surface acting along the <b>thermocline</b> in constrained bodies of water.|$|E
25|$|The {{water column}} is {{generally}} well-mixed, with {{no evidence of}} a significant halocline or <b>thermocline.</b> Mean differences in water temperature between sea surface and sea bed range from only half a degree (Celsius; 1°F) in summer to almost zero in winter, and differences in salinity are very small even when the Leeuwin Current is at its strongest.|$|E
25|$|Thermoclines, or sudden {{changes in}} {{temperature}}. Where the air temperature {{is higher than}} the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a <b>thermocline.</b>|$|E

50|$|Based on {{thermodynamic}} principles, <b>thermoclines</b> can {{be determined}} to establish the spread of cooling from particular cooling surfaces. Therefore, for each cooling device with a known and consistent surface area, the temperature can be set at the same value for each trial or experiment to generate the same <b>thermoclines</b> and replicate the same volume of deactivation. Therefore, specifically selected regions of tissue can be reversibly deactivated in a controlled and reproducible way. 20°C {{has been found to}} be the critical temperature for active neuronal signals; below this temperature, afferent signals cannot activate neurons and the tissue is considered deactivated. As long as the desired tissue reaches below the critical temperature while the surrounding tissue remains above it, the <b>thermoclines</b> generated by the device can be pre-calculated so that the temperature can be set to only deactivate the tissue of interest. Cooling can also be initiated and terminated with the same time required to reach either deactivation temperature or normal physiological temperature each time. This enables control over the onset of deactivation, its duration, and recovery for each experiment.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} how L. branchialis {{searches}} for its fish hosts, but it probably uses chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors, and follows physical clues {{in the water column}} such as those provided by haloclines and <b>thermoclines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Especially from 5°N and southward, the Somali {{current is}} {{extremely}} shallow (under 150m depth southward flow all year through). Further north, the jet deepens somewhat, reaching the permanent <b>thermocline.</b> The {{structure of the}} current around the equator is extremely complex and similarly layered to the equatorial flows, though the Somali Current is oriented north-southward instead of east-westward.|$|E
25|$|The {{stratification}} {{in a lake}} is {{not always}} the result of variation to density because of thermal gradients. Stratification within a lake can also be the result of differences in density resulting from gradients in salinity. In case of a difference in salinity, the hypolimnion and epilimnion are separated not by a <b>thermocline</b> but by a halocline, which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{form the}} base of the food chain, and need {{sunlight}} and nutrients to grow. In the ocean, these plants are mainly microscopic phytoplankton which drift in the water column. They need sunlight for photosynthesis, which powers carbon fixation, so they are found only relatively near the surface. But they also need nutrients. Phytoplankton rapidly use nutrients in the surface waters, and in the tropics, these nutrients are not usually replaced because of the <b>thermocline.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeismic {{oceanography}} is {{a developing}} research topic where new acoustic methods allow high-resolution teledetection of the thermohaline {{structure of the}} ocean. First implementations to study the Ocean Surface Boundary Layer have recently been achieved but remain very challenging due to the weakness and shallowness of such seismic reflectors. In this article, we develop a multifrequency seismic analysis of hydrographic data sets collected in a seasonally stratified midlatitude shelf by ARGO network floats to assess the detectability issue of shallow <b>thermoclines.</b> This analysis, for which sensitivity to the data reduction scheme used by ARGO floats for the transmission of the profiles is discussed, allows characterizing both the depth location and the frequency dependency of the dominant reflective feature of such complex structures. This approach provides the first statistical distribution {{of the range of}} variability of the frequency-dependent seismic reflection amplitude of the midlatitude seasonal <b>thermoclines.</b> We introduce a new parameter to quantify the overall capability of a multichannel seismic setup, including the source strength, the fold, and the ambient noise level, to detect shallow <b>thermoclines.</b> Seismic source signals are approximated by Ricker wavelets, providing quantitative guidelines to help in the design of seismic experiments targeting such oceanic reflectors. For shallow midlatitude seasonal <b>thermoclines,</b> we show that the detectability is optimal for seismic peak frequencies between 200 and 400 Hz: this means that airgun and Sparker sources are not well suited and that significant improvements of source devices will be necessary before seismic imaging of OSBL structures can be reliably attempted...|$|R

25|$|Another {{method to}} store {{heat in a}} {{hot water storage tank}} has many names: Stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit, {{stratified}} thermal storage, <b>thermocline</b> tank and water stratified tank storage but in all cases the significant difference is that pains are taken to maintain the vertical stratification of the water column, in other words to keep the hot water {{at the top of the}} tank while the water at the bottom is at a distinctly lower temperature.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the Peruvian {{anchoveta}} fishery was the world's largest fishery. The anchoveta {{population was}} greatly reduced during the 1972 El Niño event, when warm water drifted over the cold Humboldt Current, {{as part of}} a 50-year cycle, lowering the depth of the <b>thermocline.</b> The upwelling stopped and phytoplankton production plummeted, as did the anchoveta population, and millions of seabirds, dependent on the anchoveta, died. Since the mid-1980s, the upwelling has resumed, and the Peruvian anchoveta catch levels have returned to the 1960s levels.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} turn unfavourable, usually upon {{depletion of}} nutrients, diatom cells typically increase in sinking rate and exit the upper mixed layer ("bust"). This sinking is induced by either {{a loss of}} buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy resting spores. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell metabolism). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the <b>thermocline.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During the 1930s American {{engineers}} {{developed their}} own underwater sound-detection technology, and important discoveries were made, such as <b>thermoclines,</b> that would help future development. [...] After technical information was exchanged {{between the two countries}} during the Second World War, Americans began to use the term SONAR for their systems, coined as the equivalent of RADAR.|$|R
50|$|ASDIC {{produced}} an accurate range and bearing to the target, {{but could be}} fooled by <b>thermoclines,</b> currents or eddies, and schools of fish, so it needed experienced operators to be effective. ASDIC was effective only at low speeds. Above 15 kn or so, {{the noise of the}} ship going through the water drowned out the echoes.|$|R
50|$|Micrometeorology is {{significant}} in that sound waves can be refracted by wind gradients or <b>thermoclines,</b> effectively dismissing {{the effect of}} some noise barriers or terrain intervention. Geometry of area structures is an important input, since the presence of buildings or walls can block sound under certain circumstances, but reflective properties can augment sound energy at other locations.|$|R
25|$|Bottom {{trawling}} on soft bottoms also stirs up bottom sediments and loading {{suspended solids}} {{into the water}} column. One bottom trawler can put more than 10 {{times the amount of}} suspended solids pollution per hour into the water column than all the suspended solids pollution from all the sewerage, industrial, river and dredge disposal operations in Southern California combined. These turbidity plumes can be seen on Google Earth in areas where they have high resolution offshore photos (see Bottom trawling). When the turbidity plumes from bottom trawlers are below a <b>thermocline,</b> the surface may not be impacted, but less visible impacts can still occur, such as persistent organic pollutant transfer into the pelagic food chain.|$|E
25|$|Most mesopelagic fish make daily {{vertical}} migrations, {{moving at}} night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, {{and returning to}} the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over a large vertical distances, and are undertaken {{with the assistance of}} a swimbladder. The swimbladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the <b>thermocline,</b> where the temperature changes between 10 and 20°C, thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the unusual clarity of {{tropical}} waters is they are deficient in nutrients and drifting plankton. Further, the sun shines year-round in the tropics, warming the surface layer, making it less dense than subsurface layers. The warmer water is separated from deeper, cooler water by a stable <b>thermocline,</b> where the temperature makes a rapid change. This keeps the warm surface waters floating above the cooler deeper waters. In {{most parts of the}} ocean, there is little exchange between these layers. Organisms that die in aquatic environments generally sink to the bottom, where they decompose, which releases nutrients in the form of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). These nutrients are necessary for plant growth, but in the tropics, they do not directly return to the surface.|$|E
40|$|Jeffery et al. {{extensively}} {{and thoroughly}} describe how different species navigate through a three-dimensional environment. Undeniably, the world offers numerous three-dimensional opportunities. For most navigation tasks, we argue, a two-dimensional representation is nevertheless sufficient, as physical {{conditions and limitations}} such as gravity, <b>thermoclines,</b> or layers of earth encountered in a specific situation provide the very elevation data the navigating individual needs...|$|R
30|$|Hypoxia {{is defined}} as a {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) concentration of < 2.8 mg O 2 /L (equivalent to 2 mL O 2 /L or 91.4 mM). A number of factors result in hypoxia in aquatic environments, including natural phenomena such as vertical stratification resulting from the formation of <b>thermoclines.</b> However, hypoxia is often caused by excessive anthropogenic inputs of nutrients and organic matter into water bodies with poor circulation (Wu 2002).|$|R
5000|$|More importantly, {{when the}} {{submarine}} was {{under attack by}} a surface vessel using sonar, {{the information from the}} bathothermograph allowed the submarine commander to seek <b>thermoclines,</b> which are colder layers of water, that would distort the pinging from the surface vessel's sonar, allowing the submarine under attack to [...] "disguise" [...] its actual position and to escape depth charge damage and eventually to escape from the surface vessel.|$|R
25|$|He {{observed}} that anchovy larvae would first feed only when introduced to layers from {{below the surface}} containing high levels of chlorophyll and certain species of phytoplankton. These feeding-suitable phytoplankton assemblages were correlated with non-mixing <b>thermocline</b> layers. This conjecture was supported when foul weather swept up during the study and mixed the previously stratified layers (including a particulate layer below the surface) that had been sampled and introduced to the larvae. Samples derived from the same depths that proved ideal to induce first feeding prior to the storm no longer contained the necessary phytoplankton varieties and abundances; as a result, the young larvae did not feed on the post-storm samples and were unable to survive. Thus, Lasker eventually hypothesized that high-energy events that cause destratification of ocean layers have negative impacts on first-feeding northern anchovy larvae by destabilizing and decreasing their prey availability.|$|E
25|$|This {{acceleration}} of the current {{takes place in the}} direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the <b>Thermocline.</b>|$|E
25|$|The high {{vertical}} amplitude and {{the western}} orientation of the valleys of the rivers Rilska and Iliyna to the Struma valley have a considerable influence on the climate. The rugged terrain and the <b>thermocline</b> of 0.7°C per 100m determine the significant climate difference between the regions with lower and higher altitude in the park. The mean temperature at the Rila Monastery (1175m altitude) in January is –2.8°C and in June is 16°C, with minimum and maximum temperature of –25°C and 36°C respectively. The mean annual temperature at the altitude of 2000–2500m varies in the interval of 0 to 5°C; it is negative above 2500m. Rila Monastery Nature Park is characterized with frequent temperature inversions, i.e. increase in temperature with height, due to the penetration of warm and often more humid air masses of Mediterranean origin from the Struma valley to the west. The number of days with temperature inversions varies between 200 and 220 annually.|$|E
40|$|Today, the {{key role}} played by oceans in the Earth's carbon cycle is widely recognized. The {{important}} boundary to consider is not the ocean-atmosphere interface, across which the carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration gradient is small, but the seasonal and permanent <b>thermoclines,</b> whose positions range from about 20 to 300 meters in depth. Once CO 2 is delivered to depths beyond these <b>thermoclines,</b> the sequestration efficiency for CO 2 is increased. Both physical and biological pumps act {{to increase the amount}} of carbon stored in the deep sea. For the latter process, more than 90 % of the organic carbon exported (10 – 12 gigatons per year) to the deeper mesopelagic waters (i. e., the region below the upper mixed layer down to about 1000 meters, also called the twilight zone) is again respired to form CO 2. Only a very small fraction of this organic carbon (< 1 %) eventually reaches the seafloor, where it is sequestered on longer timescales. The mechanisms controlling carbon export and its fate are still insufficiently understood to allow an informed assessment of its variability...|$|R
5000|$|Least auklets feed {{predominantly}} on calanoid copepods, {{particularly those}} of the genus Neocalanus. They also eat euphausiids, pteropods and other zooplankton species. They hunt for these in stratified waters caused where upwelling and <b>thermoclines</b> cause these prey items to be tightly clumped together. Like all auks they are pursuit divers, using their wings to provide thrust and [...] "fly" [...] under the water. They are voracious predators, consuming 86% of their body weight each day.|$|R
25|$|El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events {{involve the}} {{depression}} of oceanographic <b>thermoclines,</b> severe reductions of nutrient input, {{and changes in}} storm patterns. Stress due to warm water and nutrient depletion can increase the susceptibility of kelp to storm damage and herbivorous grazing, sometimes even prompting phase shifts to urchin-dominated landscapes. In general, oceanographic conditions (that is, water temperature, currents) influence the recruitment success of kelp and its competitors, which clearly affect subsequent species interactions and kelp forest dynamics.|$|R
