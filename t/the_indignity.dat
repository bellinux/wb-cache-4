5|$|He {{set out for}} England from Scheveningen, {{arrived in}} Dover on 25 May 1660 and reached London on 29 May, his 30th birthday. Although Charles and Parliament granted amnesty to nearly all of Cromwell's {{supporters}} in the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion, 50 people were specifically excluded. In the end nine of the regicides were executed: they were hanged, drawn and quartered; others were given life imprisonment or simply excluded from office for life. The bodies of Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and John Bradshaw were subjected to <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of posthumous decapitations.|$|E
5|$|In the {{run up to}} UEFA Euro 2008, Baroš had not scored an {{international}} goal since March 2007. He started the Czech Republic's second group game against Portugal, but Portugal won 3–1 and Baroš failed to score. Jan Koller was preferred to Baroš {{in the starting lineup}} for the next match, against Turkey. Despite neither playing in the match nor even being on the pitch, Baroš suffered <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of receiving a yellow card during stoppage time {{at the end of the}} match.|$|E
50|$|To commemorate <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> <b>the</b> city of Xàtiva {{suffered}} after Philip's {{victory in}} the Battle of Almansa in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which he ordered the city to be burned and renamed San Felipe, the portrait of the monarch hangs upside down in the local museum of L'Almodí.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{are quite}} right," [...] I said. [...] "Your American {{instinct}} {{is too strong}} to brook even in imagination <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> which seem daily, hourly, and momently inflicted upon servants in your system." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film however, was {{not without}} its detractors. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle, viewed the film as [...] "broken, beleaguered", and a [...] "belittled nation's payback for <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> inflicted upon them by Borat." ...|$|R
25|$|To be {{dismissed}} first ball in both innings (i.e., two golden ducks) is to suffer <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> {{of making a}} king pair.|$|E
25|$|Never, never {{and never}} again shall {{it be that}} this {{beautiful}} land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of being the skunk of the world.|$|E
25|$|The article {{goes on to}} {{list the}} {{disastrous}} experience of many wedding days, the inadequacy of celebrant training, unpredictable cancellations by celebrants, the lowering of planning and rehearsing standards, <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of some celebrant advertising material and the “savage” over-competition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whether {{friend or}} foe, say thy say, man, and be gone," [...] cried the bluff Francisco, whose spirit {{suffered}} {{even more than}} his body from <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> {{to which he had}} been subjected that day.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not so}} much <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> {{to which}} <b>the</b> captive Britons were {{subjected}} that told upon them ultimately, as the hard, grinding, restless toil, and the insufficient food and rest--sometimes accompanied with absolute corporeal pain.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder that}} the King ventures to use Blake's name," [...] Sydney whispered, as they moved away, [...] "considering <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> that he allowed the judges to inflict {{on the body of}} the grand old sailor." ...|$|R
25|$|The Floo Network is {{controlled}} by the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry also has over 700 fireplaces in its headquarters so that officials and workers can go directly to/from work without the hustle and bustle of travelling on brooms or by Portkey - or <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of having to flush themselves in through a public toilet, as portrayed in Deathly Hallows.|$|E
25|$|The Magpies {{struggled}} {{during the}} 1960s, {{being on the}} brink of financial ruin and striving to avoid <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of having to apply for re-election to the league. This situation continued until Jack Dunnett, a local member of parliament, took control of the club. He appointed Jimmy Sirrel, a charismatic Scot who had once played for Celtic F.C., as manager in November 1969. In the 1970–71 season, The Magpies clinched the Fourth Division title in record-breaking style, remaining unbeaten at Meadow Lane.|$|E
25|$|P. Munch's {{last years}} were not happy ones. As the {{occupation}} wore on, and {{especially after the}} liberation in 1945 his record as foreign minister came under severe attack from many sides. In late 1945 he had to subject to <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of prolonged interrogation by a Parliamentary Committee set up to investigate {{the circumstances surrounding the}} occupation. Up until his death in 1948 there were repeated suggestions that he should be put on trial for negligence (and even treason). However, when the parliamentary commission delivered its final report in 1953, Munch was largely exonerated.|$|E
60|$|Arriving in Nantes {{at the end}} of January of '94, one of Marc Antoine's first visits {{happened}} to be to the People's Society, which was still quivering with rage at <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> offered by Carrier to its deputation.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] {{interrupted}} Charlie sternly, and James subsided, a crushed boy, consoling {{himself with}} Rose's new watch for <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> he suffered {{at the hands}} of the [...] "old fellows" [...] as he vengefully called his elders.|$|R
60|$|They {{explained}} in one voice that {{they liked the}} trader not at all. The ministers poured forth a recital of all <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> and wrongs that had been heaped upon them. The king broke down and wept. Mauki interrupted rudely.|$|R
25|$|Under the JG, {{people of}} working age {{who are not}} in {{full-time}} education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage. The aim is to replace unemployment and underemployment with paid employment (up to the hours desired by workers), so that those who are at any point in time surplus to the requirements of the private sector (and mainstream public sector) can earn a reasonable living rather than suffer <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> and insecurity of underemployment, poverty, and social exclusion.|$|E
25|$|By July 1969 a three-door wagon version {{intended}} for private use arrived, the LS11 Suzuki Fronte Estate, to give passenger car buyers a model with more luggage room without <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> {{of having to}} buy a commercial vehicle. The Estate had the same top-hinged rear opening, but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} those who {{suffered}} <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of imprisonment were Arthur Tooth, Vicar of St. James', Hatcham; R. W. Enraght, Rector of Holy Trinity, Bordesley; T. Pelham Dale, Rector of St. Vedast, Foster Lane, in the City of London; Sidney Faithorn Green, Rector of St John's, Miles Platting; and James Bell Cox, Vicar of St. Margaret's, Liverpool.... To these brave priests and many others who suffered we owe a great tribute of thankfulness and praise, for it was through their determination to stand by the Church in her hour of peril that we have won the tolerance and liberty we have today. The Act of Parliament under which these priests suffered {{is still on the}} Statute Book, but for all practical purposes it is dead.|$|E
6000|$|On {{all public}} occasions, Swift speaks of Sir William {{in the same}} [...] tone. But the reader will better {{understand}} how acutely he [...] remembered <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> he suffered in his household, from the [...] subjoined extracts from the Journal to Stella:— ...|$|R
50|$|Amina has {{a covert}} {{business}} partner, Jacob, who is barred from owning a business because the State considers {{him to be}} 'coloured'. He is attracted to Madeleine, a local white postmistress, but <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> and injustices of the prevalent law thwart their desire to pursue a relationship.|$|R
5000|$|... “Schneberg’s {{poetry is}} both a quiet {{reflection}} on the brevity of life and a celebration of how full it is...From tender adolescence through <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> of advanced age, Schneberg plays with perspective to broaden the portrait of her family and delivers a robust and bittersweet narrative.” ...|$|R
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of their situations was {{directly related to}} easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E
25|$|Distributions to {{qualified}} {{persons were}} monthly. However, a certain {{proportion of the}} population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.|$|E
25|$|It was as {{an opening}} batsman that Sanders was {{most often used}} by Queensland. He made his {{first-class}} cricket debut in the 1950/51 Shield season and {{was never able to}} become a regular fixture in the side, instead he was used more as a reserve batsman for Queensland, who filled a spot when a player was injured. His best effort with the bat came in the 1951/52 season, against Victoria, when he opened the batting and made 49. He missed out on his half century when he edged a ball from John Cordner to the keeper. After an absence of two years, Sanders played his 10th and final first-class match when he was called up as a middle order batsman for a Shield fixture against New South Wales. He suffered <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of scoring a pair and his dismissal in the second innings put debutant spinner Jack Treanor on a hat-trick, which he completed with the wicket of Peter Burge.|$|E
5000|$|F. W. de Klerk: [...] "I apologise in my {{capacity}} {{as leader of}} the NP to the millions who suffered wrenching disruption of forced removals; who suffered the shame of being arrested for pass law offences; who over the decades suffered <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> and humiliation of racial discrimination." ...|$|R
25|$|For agent Mills the {{attention}} was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known. On the band's tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided {{some of the}} traveling difficulties of African-Americans by touring in private railcars. These provided easy accommodations, dining, and storage for equipment while avoiding <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> of segregated facilities.|$|R
6000|$|But Kipps {{lay awake}} {{for a long}} while {{building}} his house, and in the morning at breakfast he made his meaning clear. He had smarted under <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> of house agents long enough, and this seemed to promise revenge--a fine revenge. [...] "And, you know, we might reely make rather a nice little 'ouse out of it--like we want." ...|$|R
500|$|Upon Small's {{death in}} 2003, The Independent {{wrote that the}} [...] "composer of some {{distinction}} ... had <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of working {{on one of the}} worst films of all time". Like most reviews of the soundtrack, the article criticizes the film whilst saying [...] "Small produced a fine score in the circumstances, as if anyone noticed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{repetitive}} visual {{design of}} Cybertron drew criticism from critics. Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{majority of the}} game entails walking through similar-looking corridors." [...] Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann also cited repetitive visuals, but conceded that [...] "the metallic world of Cybertron doesn't lend itself particularly well {{to a lot of}} environmental variety." [...] 1UP.com's Matt Miller also raised issue with the repetitive visuals, but provided a counterpoint in saying [...] "there are a host of features in place to save the game from spiraling into mediocrity." [...] John Hamblin of Eurogamer and Tom McShea of GameSpot also pointed out the game's vast lack of ammunition. [...] "Watching Lord Megatron repeatedly suffering <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of being shot at by drones while he desperately scours the debris looking for an elusive ammo box [...] is just sad" [...] stated Hamblin. [...] He was further critical of the game's checkpoint system, which often leaves players in difficult situations upon respawning.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many years}} the Midland Railway {{suffered}} <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> of its rival, the Great Central Railway, crossing above the station on a [...] bowstring girder bridge. This bridge became redundant in 1973 and was finally dismantled {{in the early}} 1980s. The alignment was later used for a new tramway bridge.|$|E
6000|$|P. 65. [par. 161.] Clarendon, the King's {{message to}} the privy council of Scotland:--"Of all ... <b>the</b> ... <b>indignities,</b> which had been offered to him, he doubted not the duty and affection of his Scottish {{subjects}} would have so just a resentment, that they would express to the world the sense they had of his sufferings."--Swift. Cursed Scots; to trust them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he {{continued}} with a malicious snarl, [...] "but the Earth man shall suffer for <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> {{he has put}} upon the holy of holies, nor shall any vileness be too vile to inflict upon his princess. Would that it were {{in my power to}} force him to witness the humiliation and degradation of the red woman." ...|$|R
60|$|Jakes did not {{submit to}} <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> of unbuckling portmanteaus and having his legs sniffed at by bull-dogs for nothing. Not {{by any means}} pleased by {{suggestions}} so unpleasant, Arthur took his way downstairs, determined to renew the coffin-stool question with his host. He found Angela {{waiting for him in}} the hall, and making friends with Aleck.|$|R
