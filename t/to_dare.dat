500|$|Starting with Caged Bird, Angelou made a {{deliberate}} attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including Song, {{to challenge the}} usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.

[...] Angelou stated in a 1989 interview {{that she was the}} only [...] "serious" [...] writer to choose the genre to express herself. [...] As critic Susan Gilbert stated, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agreed, and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people. [...] Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able <b>to</b> <b>dare</b> her into writing Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art", which she continued throughout her series, including her final autobiography.|$|E

500|$|As Minister of Internal Affairs, Harper {{oversaw the}} indaba (conference) of chiefs and headmen at Domboshawa in October 1964, {{at the end}} of which the tribal leaders {{unanimously}} announced their support for the government's line on independence. He continued to be linked with the premiership. During Smith's negotiations with the British government, each breakdown or setback was accompanied by speculation in Rhodesia ("Southern" [...] was dropped in late 1964) that Harper might step up to take his place. As the dispute with Britain intensified and white Rhodesians clamoured for independence, Harry Franklin reported in The Spectator in August 1965 that if Smith proved unwilling to go through with UDI, [...] "it is widely believed that... Harper will emerge from the wings, no longer an understudy, <b>to</b> <b>dare</b> what Mr Smith dare not." [...] Harper was one of four ministers chosen by Smith to accompany him to London for talks in October 1965, the others being John Wrathall (Finance), Desmond Lardner-Burke (Justice) and the Deputy Minister of Information PK van der Byl. Agreement was not reached and a month later, on 11 November 1965, Smith and his Cabinet declared Rhodesia independent.|$|E
500|$|According to African-American {{literature}} scholar Pierre A. Walker, {{the challenge}} {{for much of the}} history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able <b>to</b> <b>dare</b> her into writing Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art". [...] Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books [...] "tracts" [...] that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. [...] According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of black culture. [...] McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies [...] "as a kind of stand-in figure for the black American in Troubled Times". [...] McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that [...] "she has helped {{to pave the way for}} contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves". [...] Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of Frederick Douglass, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{settling}} {{some of his}} debts, Morris {{once again}} found himself in financial trouble, with unexpected tax bills and arguments with Hulton over payments. [...] In 1955 he sold the copyright of his signature to Hulton for £7,250 (a portion {{of which was a}} loan). [...] 45% of his £5,000 per annum salary was paid to the taxman. [...] With only one other profit-making magazine (Farmers Weekly), Hulton sought to curb Eagles costs, complaining about the use of taxis, expensive stationery, electricity and telephone bills, restaurant bills, and staff expenses. [...] At their 1957 AGM Hulton's Chairman reported a fall in profits, from £298,000 to £36,000, blaming reduced revenue from another of their magazines, Picture Post, and increased production costs. [...] Several of Morris's friends later left the company, and following a short period of internal turmoil Morris gave up the editor's chair in 1959. [...] The following year Eagle was taken over by Odhams Press. [...] Hampson's studio (by then in Epsom) was disbanded, and following creative differences he retired from the comic. [...] His duties on Dan Dare were taken up by Frank Bellamy, described by Morris as [...] "a most fastidious artist and scrupulous draftsman, and like Hampson at his best, often consumed with anxiety." [...] With Keith Watson and Don Harley, the three worked from a studio in Fleet Street. [...] The front cover was redesigned, the Eagle name appearing {{across the top of the}} page rather than in one corner, coinciding with a new-look Dare. [...] Many readers found Bellamy's changes <b>to</b> <b>Dare</b> (made at the behest of Eagles publisher) objectionable. [...] Bellamy was succeeded by Harley, who in 1962 was followed by Watson, who had returned from a short stint working on Eagles rival, Lion. [...] Watson stopped drawing Dan Dare in 1967, and was succeeded by Bruce Cornwell. [...] Following Hampson's departure, the emphasis on Dan Dare's exploration of the Solar System had changed instead to include interstellar travel. [...] Continuity became strained, and production on Dan Dare ceased in 1967, when it was replaced by reprints from earlier editions.|$|E
