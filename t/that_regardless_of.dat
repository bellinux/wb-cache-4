Thus, he observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued <b>that</b> <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> the Congress restricting the funds for the Contras, or any affair, the President (or {{in this case the}} administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of the mistake. The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E

5|$|In January 1898, Spain promised some {{concessions}} to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed. Public attention focused on the crisis and the consensus was <b>that</b> <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> who set the bomb, Spain had lost control over Cuba. McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental. Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence, but on March 20, {{the court ruled that}} the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine. As pressure for war mounted in Congress, McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence. Spain refused McKinley's proposals, and on April 11, McKinley turned the matter over to Congress. He did not ask for war, but Congress declared war anyway on April 20, with the addition of the Teller Amendment, which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The Checkers {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the Republican {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated <b>that</b> <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> what anyone said, he intended to keep one gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named Checkers by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E

5|$|Under his uncle's guidance, O'Neill {{joined the}} St George Cricket Club, in the Sydney Grade competition. He {{steadily}} moved {{up through the}} grades and broke into the first grade side {{at the age of}} 16. Sensing his potential, the club's selectors informed him <b>that</b> <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> form, he would play the full season, which allowed him to be uninhibited in his batting. He made 108 in seven innings. The next season, he was out 12 times leg before wicket in 15 innings, and run out in the other three. O'Neill attributed his failures to over-aggressiveness and resolved to improve his patience. In the second match of the new season, the 17-year-old O'Neill made his first century. With all five state selectors onlooking, he made 28 in the next match and was called into the state squad.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed <b>that</b> <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E
