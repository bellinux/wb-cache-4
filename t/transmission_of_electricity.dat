500|$|The Foote brothers' first {{projects}} in Jackson, Battle Creek and Adrian, like most pre-1900 electric power projects, were created for street lighting, with some limited residential and business lighting. Since <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> over long distances {{was not well}} understood, they were situated near the cities they served. But the demand for power was growing, driven by among other things, {{the advent of the}} streetcar and increased industrial use of electricity, outstripping the capacity of smaller rivers and existing dams. So larger rivers were sought. In 1898 the Foote brothers, working with engineering partner Fargo, constructed the Trowbridge Dam across the Kalamazoo River in order to supply the city of Kalamazoo. The dam was located near Allegan, about [...] away from the city, an unheard of distance at the time, and was the first major hydroelectric project in Western Michigan. Initially beset by power loss during transmission and other problems, the Trowbridge dam successfully provided power to a larger area than previous dams, after the Foote brothers advanced {{the state of the art}} in insulators and electric transmission equipment.|$|E

2500|$|... the {{government}} of Iceland is in talks with {{the government}} of the United Kingdom about the possibility of constructing a high-voltage direct-current connector for <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> between the two countries. Such a cable would give Iceland access to a market where electricity prices have generally been much higher than those in Iceland. Iceland has considerable renewable energy resources, especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources, and most of the potential has not been developed, partly because there is not enough demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of Iceland, but the United Kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy, and this could lead to further development of the energy resources.|$|E

40|$|Capacity {{constraints}} on <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> are raising an increasing policy concern as electricity markets are integrated around the world. But {{our understanding of}} the workings of such markets is still limited. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight the impact <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity constraints and transmission costs on electricity market auctions. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> capacity constraints, the equilibrium is asymmetric even when the suppliers are symmetric in generation capacity and costs. An increase in transmission capacity induces non-monotonic changes in firms' profits. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> constraints and zero transmission costs, an increase in transmission capacity is pro-competitive; in contrast, then the transmission costs are positive, an increase in transmission capacity could be anti-competitive...|$|R
50|$|From {{early studies}} <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> {{electrical}} phenomena {{were known to}} travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> to communications at a distance. All the known effects <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> - such as sparks, electrostatic attraction, chemical changes, electric shocks, and later electromagnetism - were applied to the problems <b>of</b> detecting controlled <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> at various distances. In 1753 an anonymous writer in the Scots Magazine suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of pith balls at the far end. Telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction were the basis of early experiments in electrical telegraphy in Europe, but were abandoned as being impractical and were never developed into a useful communication system.|$|R
