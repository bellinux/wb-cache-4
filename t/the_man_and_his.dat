5|$|The film {{received}} critical praise, {{but was a}} {{box office}} disappointment. Nonetheless, Tucker: <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Dream produced a spike in prices of Tucker Sedans, {{as well as a}} renewed appreciation for Tucker and his automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Tucker: <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Dream was {{released}} in the United States on August 12, 1988, earning $3,709,562 in its opening weekend in 720 theaters. The film eventually grossed $19.65 million in US totals and was declared a box office bomb {{because it did not}} reimburse its $24 million production budget, despite positive reviews. Pocket Books published a novelization written by Robert Tine to coincide with the release of the film. Paramount Home Video released Tucker: <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Dream on DVD in October 2000, which included audio commentary by Coppola, the 1948 promotional film Tucker: The Man and the Car (with optional commentary by Coppola), as well as a making-of featurette, Under the Hood: Making Tucker.|$|E

To these ends it organises concerts, lectures and excursions. It produces the series of Bellmanstudier, starting in 1924, so far running to 24 volumes, as well as facsimile prints of Bellman documents, essay collections, and 's Bellman porcelain.

5|$|Trying to {{cast the}} role of Garrison, Stone sent copies of the script to Costner, Mel Gibson, and Harrison Ford. Initially, Costner turned Stone down. However, the actor's agent, Michael Ovitz, was {{a big fan of}} the project and helped Stone {{convince}} the actor to take the role. Before accepting the role, Costner conducted extensive research on Garrison, including meeting <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> enemies. Two months after finally signing on to play Garrison in January 1991, his film Dances with Wolves won seven Academy Awards and so his presence greatly enhanced JFKs bankability in the studio's eyes.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> World summer {{exhibitions}} were discontinued, {{with most}} pavilions and remnants demolished between 1985 and 1987, the former site for Expo 67 on Saint Helen's Island and Notre Dame Island {{was incorporated into}} a municipal park run {{by the city of}} Montreal. In 2000, the park was renamed from Parc des Îles to Parc Jean-Drapeau, after Mayor Jean Drapeau, who had brought the exhibition to Montreal. In 2006, the corporation that runs the park also changed its name from the Société du parc des Îles to the Société du parc Jean-Drapeau. Today very little remains of Expo but two prominent buildings remain in use on the former Expo grounds: the American pavilion's metal-lattice skeleton from its Buckminster Fuller dome, now enclosing an environmental sciences museum called the Montreal Biosphere; and Habitat 67, now a condominium residence. Also, the France and Quebec pavilions now form the Montreal Casino. La Toundra Hall is part of the surviving structural remains of the Canadian pavilion. It is now a special events and banquet hall, while another part of the pavilion serves as the administration building of Parc Jean-Drapeau (Katimavik's distinctive inverted pyramid and {{much of the rest of}} the Canadian pavilion were dismantled during the 1970s).|$|E
