5|$|The {{majority}} of Sunni Muslims were Arab nationalists, but not Ba'athist, making them feel alienated. The party was chiefly dominated by minority {{groups such as}} Alawites, Druzes, and Isma'ilis, and people from the countryside in general; this created an urban–rural conflict based predominantly on ethnic differences. With its coming to power, the Ba'ath Party was threatened by the predominantly anti-Ba'athist sentiment in urban politics—probably the only reason why the Ba'athists managed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> was the rather weakly organised and fragmented opposition it faced.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>power,</b> which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} a {{mechanism}} {{through which the}} natural resource curse can operate. I posit that, {{in the presence of}} high natural resource rents, leaders lower the burden of taxation on citizens {{in order to reduce the}} demand for democratic accountability. The theory is tested using micro-level data from public opinion surveys across 15 sub-Saharan countries, in addition to country-level data on natural resource rents, taxation and election proximity. It is found that an increase in natural resource rents decreases perceived tax enforcement, which in turn reduces the demand for regular, open and honest elections. Results are robust to alternative specifications. A supplementary analysis reveals that, consistent with the two-period model proposed, the effects are more acute closer to national elections. The findings support political-economy explanations of how natural resources affect economies, in which resource rents are purported to influence the decisions of the political elite through increased returns <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>power.</b> Democracy; Political Economy; Natural Resources; Curses; Africa...|$|R

5|$|The {{genesis of}} {{the removal of the}} HNC was a power {{struggle}} within the ruling junta. Khánh, who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in September 1964 by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the Young Turks, was indebted to them and needed to satisfy their wishes <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>power.</b> The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts, and wanted to sideline them completely. As a result, they decided to hide their political motives by introducing a policy to compulsorily retire all general officers with more than 25 years of service. The chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu, an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule, did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the HNC, which mostly consisted of old men. The HNC recommended against the new policy, and the younger officers, led by I Corps commander General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{mediated}} persona of Silvio Berlusconi in the Italian press. It does so using three aspects of Italian life. First of all, a short {{analysis of the}} Italian history shows that {{in certain parts of}} Italy a strong sense of clientelism exists, as well as a high level of amoral familiarism and distrust towards the government. Secondly, Berlusconi’s personal history made him very skilled in using marketing principles for political gain making him a typical celebrity politician. And thirdly, the Italian press history enabled Berlusconi using these marketing principles because the meda are historically structured for political instrumentalization. These three aspects helped investigate the question {{whether or not it was}} Berlusconi’s media power that helped him <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> for almost twenty years. Using a qualitative content analysis on three Italian papers during two scandals Berlusconi has recently faced – having sex with an underaged! prostitute and a fraudcase that involved bribing a judge – this study shows that, in a time of crisis, Berlusconi indeed uses his own paper to mediate his persona as being anti-establishment and a patron for the entire country. He does so using marketing- and celebrity politician principles such as the use of his private life to overcome public problems. Since this image is not only seen in the pro-Berlusconi paper Il Giornale, but also in the anti-Berlusconi papers, this study concludes that Berlusconi’s mediation in the Italian press is done in a very succesfull manner. It is therefore likely that it played a large part <b>to</b> his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>power.</b> ...|$|R

This dissertation, Communication Cadres: Leaders, the Control of Communication, and Co-Optation, offers a mid-range theory between social network theory and the Iron Law of Oligarchy to theorize how oligarchies are created. By coherently combining the study of political participation, democracy, representation, accountability, network theory, access to information, cooperation, and co-optation to analyze highly democratic and participatory organizations, the problems conceptual stretching pose in analysis are identified. By comparing and contrasting how small, democratic, and highly participatory organizations govern themselves, this dissertation explores the implications for how these organizations practiced democracy with how democracy and participation are manifested in the United States. 	The Communication Cadre Theory (CCT) developed in this dissertation argues that leaders rise <b>to</b> <b>power</b> and <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> by controlling communication and information flows, which creates an environment conducive for co-optation to occur. Furthermore, the dissertation reduces the conceptual stretching of “cooperation” and “co-optation” and applies the increased rigorous definitions to the case studies used, as well as competing political theories and studies. The results support the Communication Cadre Theory.

40|$|The {{allocation}} {{and management}} of scarce resources are of central importance {{in the design of}} policies to improve social well-being. This dissertation consists of three essays; the first two deals with the problem of allocating kidneys and the third one on <b>power</b> management <b>in</b> computing devices. Kidney exchange programs are an attractive alternative for patients who need a kidney transplant and who have a willing, but medically incompatible, donor. A registry that keeps track of such patient-donor pairs can nd matches through exchanges amongst such pairs. This results in a quicker transplant for the patients involved, and equally importantly, keeps such patients from the long wait list of patients without an intended donor. As of March 2014, there were at least 99, 000 candidates waiting for a kidney transplant in the U. S. However, in 2013 only 16, 893 transplants were conducted. This imbalance between supply and demand among other factors, has driven the development of multiple kidney exchange programs in the U. S. and the subsequent development of matching mechanisms to run the programs. In the first essay we consider a matching problem arising in kidney exchanges between hospitals. Focusing on the case of two hospitals, we construct a strategy-proof matching mechanism that is guaranteed to return a matching that is at least 3 / 4 the size of a maximum cardinality matching. It is known that no better performance is possible if one focuses on mechanisms that return a maximal matching, and so our mechanism is best possible within this natural class of mechanisms. For path-cycle graphs we construct a mechanism that returns a matching that is at least 4 / 5 the size of max-cardinality matching. This mechanism does not necessarily return a maximal matching. Finally, we construct a mechanism that is universally truthful on path-cycle graphs and whose performance is within 2 / 3 of optimal. Again, it is known that no better ratio is possible. In most of the existing literature, mechanisms are typically evaluated by their overall performance on a large exchange pool, based on which conclusions and recommendations are drawn. In our second essay, we consider a dynamic framework to evaluate extensively used kidney exchange mechanisms. We conduct a simulation-based study of a dynamically evolving exchange pool during 9 years. Our results suggest that some of the features that are critical in a mechanism in the static setting have only a minor impact in its longrun performance when viewed in the dynamic setting. More importantly, features that are generally underestimated in the static setting turn to be relevant when we look at dynamically evolving exchange pool. For example, the pairs' arrival rates. In particular we provide insights into the eect on the waiting times and the probability to receive an oer of controllable features such as the frequency at which matching are run, the structures through which pairs could be matched (cycles or chains) as well as inherent features such as the pairs ABO-PRA characteristics, the availability of altruistic donors, and wether or not compatible pairs join the exchange etc. We evaluate the odds to receive an oer and the expected time to receive an oer for each ABO-PRA type of pairs <b>in</b> the model. <b>Power</b> management <b>in</b> computing devices aims to minimize energy consumption to perform tasks, meanwhile keeping acceptable performance levels. A widely used power management strategy for devices, is to transit the devices and/or components to lower power consumption states during inactivity periods. Transitions between power states consume energy, thus, depending on such costs, it may be advantageous <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> high <b>power</b> state during some inactivity periods. In our third essay we consider the problem of minimizing the total energy consumed by a 2 -power state device, to process jobs that are sent over time by a constrained adversary. Jobs can be preempted, but deadlines need to be met. In this problem, an algorithm must decide when to schedule the jobs, as well as a sequence of power states, and the discrete time thresholds at which these states will be reached. We provide an online algorithm to minimize the energy consumption when the cost of a transition to the low power state is small enough. In this case, the problem of minimizing the energy consumption is equivalent to minimizing the total number of inactivity periods. We also provide an algorithm to minimize the energy consumption when it may be advantageous <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> high <b>power</b> state during some inactivity periods. In both cases we provide upper bounds on the competitive ratio of our algorithms, and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of all online algorithms...|$|R
