According to CNN-IBN, Indian and Afghan agencies believe that the Pakistani Army's 324 Military Intelligence Battalion based in Peshawar had planned {{the attack on the}} Indian embassy and executed it in collaboration with either the Taliban or al-Qaida. Afghanistan's Interior Minister has stated that <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> were trained in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki inspired the bombers. The bombers transcribed lectures of al-Awlaki while plotting the bombings. His materials {{were found in}} the possession of accused accomplices of <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers.</b> Awlaki has also been linked to the 2006 Ontario terrorism plot in Canada, the 2007 Fort Dix attack plot in New Jersey, the 2009 Fort Hood shooting in Texas, and the failed attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253, a commercial flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, on Christmas Day, 2009.

25|$|Officials {{suspect that}} Muslim rebels from the troubled North Caucasus region that {{includes}} Chechnya {{are responsible for}} the attack. The link to the Caucasian group was immediate. According to preliminary reports, law enforcement were notified about possible terror acts through three telegrams indicating potential threats to Moscow's transport system, but <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> passed through the security. Unofficial reports the morning before the attacks took place indicate many female passengers of North Caucasian appearance were stopped and checked by Moscow security enforcement under pretence of routine ID verifications, and taken to local precincts.|$|E

25|$|On 22 March 2007, {{three men}} {{were arrested in}} {{connection}} with the bombings. Two were arrested at 1pm at Manchester Airport, attempting to board a flight bound for Pakistan that afternoon. They were apprehended by undercover officers who had been following the men as part of a surveillance operation. They had not intended to arrest the men that day, but believed they could not risk letting the suspects leave the country. A third man was arrested in the Beeston area of Leeds at an address on the street where one of <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> had lived before the attacks.|$|E
25|$|In early March 1976, Maeno flew around Kodama's {{neighborhood}} in Setagaya, gaining {{knowledge of the}} area in preparation for an attack. On the morning of March 23, 1976, Maeno arrived in the western suburbs of Tokyo at Chofu Airport with two friends. All three were dressed in the uniforms of kamikaze pilots, and Maeno informed airport officials that they were renting two planes for a kamikaze segment of a film. The flight was to prepare publicity for a planned film on <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers.</b> Before 9:00a.m., the actor posed in his uniform, with white scarf, rising-sun images on his sleeve, and a headband {{in front of the}} Piper Cherokee plane he had rented.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{investigation}} {{indicated that}} the bombings were perpetrated by the militant Islamist Caucasus Emirate group. On March 31, Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He also stated that such attacks in Russia would continue unless Russia grants independence to Muslim states in the North Caucasus region. The man who brought <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov, along with four other militants, {{was killed in an}} operation in Dagestan. He is believed to be a militant behind the bombings, a close associate of Doku Umarov and the husband of Mariam Sharipova, one of the two suicide bombers.|$|E

2500|$|On May 13, FSB {{director}} Aleksandr Bortnikov {{announced that}} they had identified {{all members of the}} group behind the attack and that three of the members were killed during a raid in an attempt to detain them, one of them being the person who escorted <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> from Dagestan to Moscow. Bortnikov was quoted as saying: [...] "To our great regret, we were unable to detain them alive because they put up fierce armed resistance and were killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Investigators {{identified}} {{four men}} who they alleged had been <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers.</b> This made the bombings {{the first ever}} suicide attack in the British Isles. Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister and future President of France, caused consternation at the British Home Office when he briefed the press {{that one of the}} names had been described the previous year at an Anglo-French security meeting as an asset of British intelligence. Home Secretary Charles Clarke said later that this was [...] "not his recollection".|$|E
2500|$|Time {{described}} Battlestar Galactica as [...] "a gripping sci-fi {{allegory of}} the war on terror, complete with monotheistic religious fundamentalists (here genocidal cyborgs called Cylons), sleeper cells, civil-liberties crackdowns and even a prisoner-torture scandal". The show attempted to maintain its realism by referencing familiar elements of contemporary history – Laura Roslin's swearing in on Colonial One directly [...] "cited the swearing in of Lyndon B. Johnson after the Kennedy assassination" [...] – and the developing political situation since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Many people have drawn parallels between the Cylons and Al Qaeda" [...] and according to The Guardian [...] "Battlestar Galactica is the only award-winning drama that dares tackle the war on terror". The show has also tackled issues regarding terrorist sleeper cells with stories involving the reality and fear of Cylon suicide attacks, Cylon Number 5 (Aaron Doral) in the episode called Litmus, sneaks aboard the Galactica and blows himself {{up in the middle of}} the corridor and sleeper agent Lt. Sharon [...] "Boomer" [...] Valerii activates after destroying a Cylon basestar and shooting Commander Adama at the end of season 1. (Note that Sharon, as with some of the other human-form Cylons, had no idea that she was a Cylon.) Similar themes are revisited in season 3 (Episode 3.1, [...] "Occupation") with a far different perspective: the humans, rather than the Cylons, are <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers.</b> It has been suggested that these plotlines extensively [...] "hinted at war-on-terrorism overtones." [...] After 9/11, the original series' [...] "broad premise – the human military's struggles in the wake of a massive terrorist attack – suddenly gained resonance" [...] and let the show tackle issues like suicide bombings, torture ("evoking the darker side {{of the war}} on terror") and [...] "civil liberties crackdowns".|$|E
