5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivores. Plants can sense being <b>touched,</b> <b>and</b> they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E

5|$|The {{next night}} is Krusty's {{farewell}} special, and as Krusty describes {{the history of}} his career, Bob straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob, holding himself responsible of turning Bob into a ruthless criminal. Krusty even goes far by singing a song on behalf of Bob, stating how very remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, Bob is <b>touched</b> <b>and</b> develops a change of heart, but does {{not have time to}} stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained chimp Mr. Teeny sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, killing all the executives, though they would later reanimate themselves like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Bart comes out of his hypnotic state and he and his family serve dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, police decide to execute Bob by guillotine for his plot of attempted murder, although he argues with Chief Wiggum that he should have a trial for it at least.|$|E
5|$|Torrential rain {{prevented}} {{the resumption of}} the Grand Prix for over two hours, until the rain eased at 15:50 local time. The race was restarted behind the safety car with the drivers in the positions held before the suspension. Vettel was first, followed by Kobayashi, Massa, Heidfeld, Petrov and di Resta. Webber was in seventh place with Alonso, de la Rosa and Button behind. The safety car remained out for seven laps, during which the circuit began drying enough to be suitable for intermediate tyres, and D'Ambrosio pitted on lap 33 to change from the full wets. Vettel began to extend the lead over Kobayashi once the safety car came in on lap 35, as Massa and Heidfeld fought for Kobayashi's second place. Schumacher led several cars into the pitlane to change to intermediate tyres, while Button, Heidfeld and di Resta were among those who pitted the next lap. Vettel and Karthikeyan were the only drivers not to change tyres by lap 37, when Button came upon tenth placed Alonso as he exited the pitlane. As Button attempted to pass at turn 3 the two cars <b>touched,</b> <b>and</b> Alonso's Ferrari spun and beached upon a curb, bringing out the safety car. When the race resumed three laps later, Vettel, Kobayashi and Massa retained their positions, as Heidfeld, di Resta, Webber and Schumacher fought for fourth place. Button had a punctured tyre after the collision and was in twenty-first and last place, but immediately began to make up positions and was 14th by lap 44. Di Resta damaged his front wing attempting to overtake Heidfeld; the subsequent pit-stop and drive-through penalty dropped him down to last. Schumacher, having overtaken Webber, passed Heidfeld in fourth place, and set the fastest lap of the race.|$|E

However, these have fallen short of expectations as opportunistic organisms put patients and healthcare workers at risk. Since approximately 80% of infectious diseases are known to be transmitted by touch, and pathogens found in healthcare facilities can survive on inanimate surfaces for days and even months, the microbial burden of frequently touched surfaces is believed to play a significant role in infection causality. Surfaces in hospitals and healthcare facilities are frequently <b>touched</b> <b>and</b> therefore could become reservoirs of infection.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} {{self-recognition}} in mirrors {{is independent of}} familiarity with reflecting surfaces. In some cases the rouge test {{has been shown to}} have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a Cameroonian Nso sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person <b>touched)</b> <b>and</b> mutual eye contact. A strong correlation between self-concept and object permanence have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.|$|E
40|$|Resumo: Reiki, Toque Terapêutico (TT) e Healing Touch (HT) são Técnicas de Imposição de Mãos (TIM) que trabalham na harmonização do fluxo natural de energia vital do organismo. Esta energia, apesar de ainda não ser qualificada pela física, é citada por alguns autores como sendo o biocampo: o campo de energia intrínseco a todos os seres vivos, chamado também de campo quântico, clássico e não clássico. Um dos efeitos mais comumente reportados proveniente da aplicação dessas técnicas é o relaxamento, este, pode auxiliar na melhora da qualidade de vida de pessoas com câncer, assim como no alívio de sintomas como dor e stress-ansiedade. Este trabalho teve como objetivo verificar o uso e o efeito das TIM aplicadas ao câncer, a dor e ao stress-ansiedade, para isto foi realizada uma revisão sistemática da {{literatura}} nas bases de dados "PubMed/Medline", "Lilacs", "Embase", "Ebsco" e "Web Of Science" com os termos: "Reiki and Cancer, Reiki and Pain, Reiki and Stress, Reiki <b>and</b> Anxiety, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress e Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety".

25|$|Kee MacFarlane, {{a social}} worker {{employed}} by the Children's Institute International, developed {{a new way to}} interrogate children with anatomically correct dolls and used them in an effort to assist disclosures of abuse with the McMartin children. After asking the children to point to the places on the dolls where they had allegedly been <b>touched</b> <b>and</b> asking leading questions, MacFarlane diagnosed sexual abuse in virtually all the McMartin children. She coerced disclosures by using lengthy interviews that rewarded discussions of abuse and punished denials. The trial testimony that resulted from such methods was often contradictory and vague on all details except for the assertion that the abuse had occurred. Although the initial charges in the McMartin case featured allegations of Satanic abuse and a vast conspiracy, these features were dropped relatively early in the trial, and prosecution continued only for non-ritual allegations of child abuse against only two defendants. After three years of testimony, McMartin and Buckey were acquitted on 52 of 65 counts, and the jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges against Buckey, with 11 of 13 jurors choosing not guilty. Buckey was re-charged and two years later released without conviction.|$|E

25|$|In the 2013 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, Johnson won {{his record}} fourth All-Star race after a fast pit stop {{allowed him to}} start the final 10-lap sprint in second, and later managed to pass Kasey Kahne for the victory. One week later, Johnson {{finished}} 22nd after spinning sideways late in the race. At Dover, Johnson led 143 laps, but finished 17th when he jumped Juan Pablo Montoya on the last restart causing NASCAR to issue him a penalty. He was able to redeem himself for this mistake the following week at Pocono by earning the pole position, leading the most laps, and winning his third race of the season, which increased his point lead to 51 points over Edwards. This also snapped a nine-year winless streak for Johnson at Pocono since sweeping both of the track's 2004 NASCAR Cup Series races. At the Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan, Johnson closed in on Greg Biffle for the lead with less than ten laps left, but suffered a flat tire with less than five laps to go. Johnson would finish the race in 28th, his worst finish of the season to that point. Johnson then finished ninth at Sonoma. At Kentucky, Johnson started third. He had the dominant car of the race, leading 182 of 267 laps. However, on a restart on lap 246, Johnson was slow {{to get up to}} speed and was subsequently <b>touched</b> <b>and</b> spun by Joey Logano, costing Johnson a shot at the win and giving the race to Matt Kenseth. Johnson was able to charge through the field after the caution and restart to salvage a ninth-place finish.|$|E
