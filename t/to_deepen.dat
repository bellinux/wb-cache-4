5|$|After being named, Kyle tracked north-northeastward before {{gradually}} executing a clockwise loop. Initially, {{the circulation}} center remained partly {{exposed to the}} south and west of the deep convection. On September22, the convection increased around the center as the system developed a warm thermal core, and as a result it was reclassified as a fully tropical cyclone. A building anticyclone to the northwest turned Kyle to the southwest. After the storm briefly weakened, previously moderate wind shear began decreasing, which allowed convection <b>to</b> <b>deepen</b> and the outflow over the cyclone to improve. Tracking over progressively warmer waters, Kyle began developing a banding eye feature late on September24. Slow strengthening continued, and the storm attained hurricane status at 1200UTC on September25. The next day, Kyle reached peak winds of 85mph (130km/h) about 490miles east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E

Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas.

5|$|Hurricane Daisy {{brought the}} worst {{flooding}} to New England since Hurricane Diane in 1955. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1962 Atlantic hurricane season, Daisy developed from a tropical disturbance located well {{east of the}} Leeward Islands on September29. Initially a tropical depression, it headed west-northwestward and failed to strengthen significantly.

Around that time, the storm turned back to the west-northwest and continued <b>to</b> <b>deepen.</b> Daisy reached hurricane status late on October3. Two days later, it became a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, but briefly weakened back to a Category1 on October6.|$|E

The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red wine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the addition of elderberries <b>to</b> <b>deepen</b> the color.

5|$|Kaga {{designed}} Gaiden {{to address}} issues raised with the first game, such as tedious elements of map navigation. The system of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was used as base for various improvements to aspects such as enemy AI, although the gameplay adjustments ended up removing some of the strategic elements. These elements included a navigable overworld and more overt role-playing elements, along {{with the introduction of}} the class evolution system. Balancing these elements proved challenging for the team. The game made use of the new MMC4 memory chip, developed partially in response to the memory capacity problems faced during the development of the first game. For the story, Kaga wanted <b>to</b> <b>deepen</b> the relationship between the player and their units, represented through the growth of the characters through their battles.
