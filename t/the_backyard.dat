5|$|In {{terms of}} competitiveness, {{intensity}} and longevity, <b>the</b> <b>Backyard</b> Brawl with the Pittsburgh Panthers is West Virginia's fiercest and most storied rivalry. Separated by only 70 miles, the two universities have competed on a mostly annual basis since 1895 (beginning in 1920 and resuming again in 1943 after World War II). Although Pitt holds a 61–40–3 series lead, {{more than half}} of its victories in <b>the</b> <b>Backyard</b> Brawl came prior to 1952 when the Panthers dominated the series 34–9–1. The Mountaineers hold a 26–22–2 edge over the Panthers since 1962 when the series began to interchange annually between Morgantown and Pittsburgh. West Virginia has also won seven of the last ten meetings. Put on hiatus following the 2011 season due to conference realignment, the series will resume with four games running from 2022–2025.|$|E
