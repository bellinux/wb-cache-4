40|$|The large {{rate of the}} J/ψ+η_c {{production}} {{observed by}} the Belle collaboration has posed a serious challenge {{to our understanding of}} the quarkonium. We examine a scenario that there exists a light scalar boson around 5 GeV, with an enhanced coupling solely to the charm quark. Such a scenario would explain the Belle anomaly. It also predicts a significant increase in J/ψ plus open charm pair production. An immediate <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> boson is to look for a peak around 5 GeV in the recoil mass spectrum of J/ψ, because <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> boson can also be produced in association with the J/ψ. Finally, we also point out that the process e^+ e^- → H γ is sizable for observation. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Single {{scalar field}} {{inflation}} with a generic, non-quadratic in derivatives, field Lagrangian is considered. It is shown that non-Gaussianity of curvature perturbations {{is characterized by}} two dimensionless amplitudes. One of these amplitudes can be {{expressed in terms of}} the usual inflationary observables [...] <b>the</b> <b>scalar</b> power, <b>the</b> tensor power, and the tensor index.

40|$|Super Feynman {{rules for}} any superspin are given for massive N= 1 supersymmetric theories, {{including}} momentum superspace on-shell legs. This {{is done by}} extending, from space to superspace, Weinberg's perturbative approach to quantum field theory. Superfields work just as a device that allow one to write super Poincare-covariant superamplitudes for interacting theories, relying neither in path integral nor canonical formulations. Explicit transformation laws for particle states under finite supersymmetric transformations are offered. C, P, T, and R transformations are also worked out. A key feature of this formalism {{is that it does}} not require the introduction of auxiliary fields, and when introduced, their purpose is just to render supersymmetric invariant the time-ordered products in the Dyson series. <b>The</b> formalism is <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cubic <b>scalar</b> superpotential. It is found that when a superparticle is its own antisuperparticle the lowest-order correction of time-ordered products, together with its covariant part, corresponds to the Wess-Zumino model potential.
