25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the <b>tool</b> <b>position</b> above the weld plate.|$|E

40|$|High-precision <b>tool</b> <b>positioning</b> {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} requirements for the industry now-a-days. Earlier, <b>tool</b> <b>positioning</b> and its verification were done using sensors etc. In this paper, an algorithm has been proposed to increase the <b>tool</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy by analyzing the information obtained using CCD camera. The images of lathe tool are used for carrying out the experiments. Firstly, the images of lathe tool, before and after movement, are captured. From these images, the distance traversed by the tool is calculated which is the observed distance. <b>Tool</b> <b>positioning</b> can be achieved accurately if the errors arising out of target (distance expected to be traversed by the <b>tool)</b> and observed <b>position</b> of the <b>tool</b> are optimized.

40|$|Free Form Thick Layered Object Manufacturing FF-TLOM {{is based}} on {{application}} of a reshapeable cutting device, which allows a free form shaping of thick polystyrene foam layers. Once manufactured, these layers are stacked to produce a physical model. Tool path generation for the heated flexible blade tool is a challenging task, since it influences {{the quality of the}} manufactured objects as well as the effectiveness of the fabrication process. The difficulties arise from the following facts: (a) when slicing is computed, the instantaneous <b>tool</b> <b>positions</b> are defined by matching the blade profile against the nominal shape of the CAD model, (b) the <b>tool</b> <b>positions</b> calculated relative to the cut layers have to be converted into the global reference frame of the layer cutting equipment, (c) the resultant tool path should maintain the achieved preciseness approximating the front surface of the layers, and (d) it is impossible to calculate all points of the tool path in real time. This paper proposes an effective tool path calculation method for flexible blade cutting. The contour of the layers is converted into an ordered set of smooth and awkward boundary features. For the smooth boundary features, the <b>tool</b> <b>positions</b> are computed by dense sampling in order to achieve the optimal cutting...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of bending on a press brake, each {{is defined by}} the {{relationship}} of the end <b>tool</b> <b>position</b> to the thickness of the material. These three are Air Bending, Bottoming and Coining. The configuration of the tools for these three types of bending are nearly identical. A die with a long rail form tool with a radiused tip that locates the inside profile of the bend is called a punch. Punches are usually attached to the ram of the machine by clamps and move to produce the bending force. A die with a long rail form tool that has concave or V shaped lengthwise channel that locate the outside profile of the form is called a die. Dies are usually stationary and located under the material on the bed of the machine. Note that some locations do not differentiate between the two different kinds of dies (punches and dies.) The other types of bending listed use specially designed tools or machines to perform the work.|$|E

Consequently, the tool movements are discontinue in tangency and in curvature which create vibrations and consequently affects the finish of the surface. With the development of CNC interpolators that accept B-Spline curve, it is more advantageous to use them.

40|$|The {{parametric}} interpolators {{of modern}} CNC machines use Taylor&# 039;s series approximation to generate successive parameter {{values for the}} calculation of x, y, z coordinates of <b>tool</b> <b>positions.</b> In order to achieve greater accuracy, higher order derivatives are required at every sampling period which complicates the calculation for contours represented by NURBS curve. In addition, this method calculates the chordal error in a given segment through estimation of the curvature neglecting {{a fraction of the}} error. In order to avoid calculating higher derivatives and make the calculations simpler, this paper proposes the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method for the determination of successive <b>tool</b> <b>positions</b> requiring the calculation of the first derivatives only. Furthermore, a method of estimating the chordal error on the average value of parameters at the end points of a given curve segment is proposed here that does not require the calculation of curvature at every segment. Finally, a variable feedrate interpolation scheme is designed combining the RK method of parameter calculation and the proposed method of chordal error calculation. Results show that reduced chordal error and feedrate fluctuations are achievable with the proposed interpolator compared to the conventional interpolator based on Taylor&# 039;s approximation with higher order terms...|$|R

40|$|Five-axis flank milling {{has been}} {{commonly}} used in the manufacturing of complex workpieces because of its greater productivity than that of three-axis or five-axis end milling. The advantage of this milling operation largely depends on effective cutter location planning. The finished surface sometimes suffers from large geometrical errors induced by improper <b>tool</b> <b>positioning,</b> due to the non-developability of most ruled surfaces in industrial applications. In addition, a slender flank-milling cutter may be deflected when subjected to large cutting forces during the machining process, further degrading the surface quality or even breaking the cutter. This paper proposes a novel tool path planning scheme to address those problems. A simple but effective algorithm is developed to adaptively allocate a series of cutter locations over the design surface with each one being confined within an angular rotation range. The allocation result satisfies a given constraint of geometrical errors on the finished surface, which consists of the <b>tool</b> <b>positioning</b> errors at each cutter location and the sweeping errors between consecutive ones. In addition, a feed rate scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the machining efficiency subject to the cutting force constraint and the kinematical constraints of a specific machine configuration. Simulation and experimental tests are conducted to validate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms. Both the machining efficiency and finish surface quality are greatly improved compared with conventional cutter locations...|$|R
