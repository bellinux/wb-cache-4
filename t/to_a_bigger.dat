5|$|On 19 August 2010, {{it emerged}} {{that the new}} owners King Power wanted to rename the stadium The King Power Stadium, and had plans to {{increase}} the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion. On 7 July 2011, Leicester City confirmed the Walkers Stadium would now {{be known as the}} King Power Stadium. In 2015, vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha stated plans were in place to increase the capacity of the stadium to around 42,000. Relocation <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> stadium has also been considered.|$|E
5|$|With {{the switch}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with less shanks. However this has diminished his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot. Since his {{comeback}} in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both {{down the line}} and cross court which was cited {{as the reason for}} his defeat of Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th Round.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{was born}} in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 10 July 1927. His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself {{frequently}} out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer when he was 12. He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his thinking in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so {{they would be more}} adept in control when progressing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> football.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} founded in 1883 as the Ottawa Senators, a {{successful}} independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in 1917. From the mid-1920s onward, they endured financial strain caused, in part, by being in the NHL's smallest market. The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season. Upon their return to play, having sold their better players {{in an effort to}} raise funds, the Senators finished in last place for two straight seasons and continued to lose money. Following the repeat last place finish, the team decided that it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> market.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of network}} effects, {{successful}} platforms enjoy increasing returns to scale.

This sets network platforms apart from most traditional manufacturing and service businesses. In traditional businesses, growth beyond some point usually leads to diminishing returns: Acquiring new customers becomes harder as fewer people, not more, find the firm's value proposition appealing.|$|E

25|$|Just before Barnes left Watford, manager Graham Taylor had {{departed}} to Aston Villa to be succeeded by Dave Bassett, who had resigned himself to losing Barnes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> club. He offered Alex Ferguson {{the chance to}} sign Barnes for Manchester United, but Ferguson rejected the opportunity to sign Barnes as he still had faith in United's left winger Jesper Olsen. This was revealed in Ferguson's autobiography Managing My Life in 1999. Ferguson has since expressed regret at not signing Barnes.|$|E
25|$|Though often {{environmental}} and economic agendas may be at odds, the ‘ban the can’ legislation along with being environmentally driven, was also economically motivated as it protected jobs. Seaman's Beverages, a bottling company and carbonated beverage manufacturer, was established in 1939 and a major employer in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Making it illegal to retail cans led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> share of the carbonated beverage market for Seamans. Seamans Beverages was eventually acquired by Pepsi Bottling Group Inc in 2002 prior to {{the lifting of the}} legislation.|$|E

In {{an effort to keep}} Batistuta, Fiorentina hired Giovanni Trapattoni as coach and promised to do everything to win the Scudetto. After an excellent start to the season, Batistuta suffered an injury that kept him out of action for more than a month. Losing momentum, Fiorentina lost the lead and finished the season in third place, although the result enabled them to participate in the Champions League the following season.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the {{folic acid}} {{fortification}} regulation in 1996, the projected increase in folic acid intake was 100nbsp&µg/d.

Folic acid intake above the {{upper tolerable intake level}} (1000µg folic acid/d) increased only among those individuals consuming folic acid supplements as well as folic acid found in fortified grain products. Taken together, folic acid fortification has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> increase in folic acid intake than first projected.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> stage. But when expanding it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

25|$|Affiliate {{marketing}} {{has grown}} quickly since its inception. The e-commerce website, {{viewed as a}} marketing toy {{in the early days}} of the Internet, became an integrated part of the overall business plan and in some cases grew <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> business than the existing offline business. According to one report, the total sales amount generated through affiliate networks in 2006 was £2.16billion in the United Kingdom alone. The estimates were £1.35billion in sales in 2005. MarketingSherpa's research team estimated that, in 2006, affiliates worldwide earned US$6.5billion in bounty and commissions from a variety of sources in retail, personal finance, gaming and gambling, travel, telecom, education, publishing, and forms of lead generation other than contextual advertising programs.|$|E
25|$|In general, though, Machen {{thoroughly}} disliked {{work at the}} newspaper, and it {{was only}} the need to earn money for his family which kept him at it. The money came in useful, allowing him to move in 1919 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> house with a garden, in St John's Wood, which became a noted location for literary gatherings attended by friends such as the painter Augustus John, D. B. Wyndham Lewis, and Jerome K. Jerome. Machen's dismissal from the Evening News in 1921 came as a relief in one sense, though it caused financial problems. Machen, however, was recognized as a great Fleet Street character by his contemporaries, and he remained in demand as an essay writer for much of the twenties.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} of 1998, Kill joined the band as the new drummer, while they began to gain real {{recognition}} and notoriety in the indie scene. At this moment they had {{caught the attention of}} the recently re-incarnated Misfits. Now being headed by original member and long time bassist Jerry Only, Balzac was asked to open for The Misfits when they came for their first Japanese tour. This would mark a milestone in the band's career, which would lead to much success for Balzac outside Japan in the coming years. This year was explosive to the band, as they were playing in much larger venues and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> crowd. They released a split CD with The Hate Honey, were featured on the Devilock Night video, released their own VHS, entitled Video Deep II, and their third album, 13 Stairway - The Children of the Night. They launched a full-scale all-Japan tour to promote their album and played to sold-out crowds.|$|E

25|$|The luthiers {{also worked}} {{with the idea of}} modifying the {{mandolin}} to meet local musical styles, making experimental changes to the necks of violins, guitars and mandolins to suit them to Cai luong opera music. In the mid-1930s, they made concave frets, scooping out extra wood between the frets, making the space between them deep and to allow the musicians to bend the notes, and stringing them with four single strings. Musicians Hai Nén and Hai Nhành were associated with the instruments, possibly being the first to use them. The sunken-fret mandolin (mandolin phím lõm) did not meet the musical needs as well as the sunken-fret guitar, because the mandolin's rigidity made it painful to get the same effects from the strings. Also the mandolin's narrow fretboard made it difficult to hit the notes. Another reason to move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> instrument was the pitch range of the mandolin, high pitched and not as useful to accompany singing as the instruments that replaced it in the opera.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{intelligence}} did {{not fall}} for German deceptions that they might attack in Italy or the Balkans. At an Army Commanders Conference (Saturday 2 March), Cox reported that a German offensive was imminent, perhaps designed to “cut off the Cambrai salient” (Third Army sector) and draw in British reserves, although it was still expected to be prior <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> offensive in Flanders or Champagne. Haig privately thought the Guards Division “our only reliable reserve”. He has been criticised for writing (2 March) that he “was only afraid that the Enemy would find our front so very strong that he will hesitate to commit his Army to the attack with the almost certainty of losing very heavily”. The claim {{does not appear in}} the official minutes, which merely warn of a “prolonged” German offensive. In Sheffield's view he was in fact referring to the First, Third and Fourth (actually the former Second Army at Ypres, temporarily renumbered as it was under Rawlinson's command whilst Plumer was away commanding in Italy) Army fronts which he had spent a week inspecting, and which were well-defended – Smuts and Hankey had come to the same conclusion in January. Haig thought the Canadians “really fine disciplined soldiers now and so smart and clean” compared to the Australians.|$|E
