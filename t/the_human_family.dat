5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>family</b> dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1855, {{the letters}} of the word [...] "Dollars" [...] were enlarged, {{following}} complaints from the public. The same year, coinage began at the San Francisco Mint, where 6,600were struck as opposed to 50,555at Philadelphia. [...] Mintages at Philadelphia declined {{for the remainder of the}} decade, to 7,036by 1860; pieces were also struck at San Francisco in 1856, 1857, and 1860. [...] In 1859, early numismatic writer Montroville W. Dickeson wrote of the three-dollar piece, [...] "it is very unpopular, being frequently mistaken for a quarter eagle, and often counted as a five-dollar piece. [...] It is exceedingly annoying to that portion of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>family</b> whose vision is dependent on artificial aid, and we think its retirement would meet with public approbation." [...] Perhaps a dozen contemporary numismatists collected three-dollar pieces; those who were serious ordered proof coins from the Mint. [...] Coins in this condition became easier to obtain from Philadelphia as officials responded to the rise in interest in coin collecting which followed the introduction of the Flying Eagle cent in 1857.|$|E
