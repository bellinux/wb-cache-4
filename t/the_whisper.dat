5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly beat down Hardy and {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried {{to come back with}} a mule kick from the corner, but MVP moved out of the way, leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing <b>the</b> <b>Whisper</b> in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} song have been described: the day song {{is the most}} common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an antiphonal duet, {{generally}} {{over the course of}} the day and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. <b>The</b> <b>whisper</b> song is sung more commonly in wet or windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree warbling soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the breeding song at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and more complex than the day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may chatter or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes.|$|E
25|$|While {{flicking}} is used {{to higher}} notes, <b>the</b> <b>whisper</b> key is used for lower notes. From the A right below middle C and lower, <b>the</b> <b>whisper</b> key is pressed with the left thumb and held {{for the duration of}} the note. This prevents cracking, as low notes can sometimes crack into a higher octave. Both flicking and using <b>the</b> <b>whisper</b> key is especially important to ensure notes speak properly during slurring between high and low registers.|$|E

25|$|The {{left thumb}} alone {{operates}} nine keys: B1, B1, C1, D1, D4, C4 (also B4), two keys when combined create A4, and <b>the</b> <b>whisper</b> key. <b>The</b> <b>whisper</b> key {{should be held}} down for notes between and including F1 and G2 and certain other notes. Additional notes can be created with the left thumb keys. The D1 and bottom key above <b>the</b> <b>whisper</b> key on the tenor joint (C key) together create both C2 and C3. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering, to create E4 and F4. D4 and C4 together create C4. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A4 are used with slightly altered fingering on the boot joint, B4 is created. <b>The</b> <b>whisper</b> key may also be used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound.|$|E

2500|$|The {{right thumb}} {{operates}} four keys. The top key {{is used to}} produce B2 and B3, and is used in B4, C4, D4, F4, and E4. The large circular key, otherwise known as the [...] "pancake key", is held down for all the lowest notes from E1 down to B1. It is also used, like <b>the</b> <b>whisper</b> key, in additional fingerings for muting the sound. For example, in Ravel's [...] "Boléro", the bassoon is asked to play the ostinato on G4. This is easy to perform with the normal fingering for G4, but with the E1 key (pancake key). The next key operated by the right thumb {{is known as the}} [...] "spatula key": its primary use is to produce F1 and F2. The bottom key is used less often: is used to produce A1 (G1) and A2 (G2), when the tone may be improved by combining this with the backmost key E1 of the right hand little finger: this is most advantageous in pieces like Dukas's [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice".|$|E
