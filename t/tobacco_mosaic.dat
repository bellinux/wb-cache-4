Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like <b>tobacco</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E

40|$|Expression of many host genes can {{be altered}} during virus infection. In a {{previous}} study of sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) infection in maize (Zea mays), we observed that expression of ZmTrm 2, a gene encoding thioredoxin m, was up-regulated at about 10 days post-inoculation (dpi). In this present study we determined that ZmTrm 2 silencing in maize by virus-induced gene silencing significantly enhanced systemic SCMV infection. In contrast transient over-expression of ZmTrm 2 in maize protoplasts inhibited accumulation of SCMV viral RNA. Furthermore, we found that in inoculated Nicotiana tabacum leaves transient expression of ZmTrm 2 inhibited accumulation of the RNA of <b>tobacco</b> vein-banding <b>mosaic</b> virus (TVBMV), a potyvirus infecting dicotyledonous plants. Interestingly in ZmTrm 2 transiently expressed N. tabacum leaves, we detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR a reduced level of the mRNA of class I beta- 1, 3 -glucanase (GluI), a protein known to {{have a role in}} cell wall callose deposition and viral movement.

40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{systems were}} used to study the translocation of virus particles in plants and translocation followed by infection of non-wounded plant cells. Transloca-tion of virus particles in cut plant stems occurred with e beetle-transmissible viruses southern bean mosaic, bean pod mottle and cowpea severe mosaic, but not with sunn hemp <b>mosaic</b> and <b>tobacco</b> ringspot viruses, which are not transmitted by eetles. When purified viruses were injected below sections of steam-killed stems, only the beetle-transmissible viruses were translocated and infected non-wounded tissue above the steam-killed area.

These results uggest that both translocation of virus particles in the xylem of plants and establishment of infection in non-wounded tissue are key properties of viruses that are transmitted by beetles.

5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and <b>tobacco</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied <b>tobacco</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as <b>tobacco</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 22 - 23). Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a method of regulation of protein expression in which a change in reading frame during translation brings about the formation of an alternative gene product. This process {{is an important part of}} the replicative machinery of many RNA viruses, including HIV- 1, the causative agent of AIDS. Programmed - 1 frameshifting is commonly stimulated via an as yet undetermined mechanism that requires an RNA structural motif in the mRNA coding sequence known as an RNA pseudoknot, found just downstream of the site of - 1 slippage. Recently, it was shown that engineering two structural features of the pseudoknots derived from <b>tobacco</b> yellow <b>mosaic</b> virus (a specifically placed loop 2 adenosine), TYMV, and mouse mammary tumor virus (an unpaired adenosine at the stem 1 - stem 2 junction), MMTV could restore efficient frameshifting to a functionally inactive pseudoknot. Thermodynamic analysis presented here shows that a mutant pseudoknot lacking the loop 2 adenosine forms a pseudoknot structure which is stabilized by 1. 4 ? 0. 5 kcal mol??. In contrast, two other pseudoknots, in which the junction adenosine residue was substituted with guanosine and the and the other one in which the loop 2 adenosine was replaced with guanosine, both formed moderately less stable structures. All three RNAs display frameshifting efficiencies greatly reduced relative to the wild type RNA. Although these findings suggest that there is no clear correlation between pseudoknot stability and frameshifting efficiency, our data does suggest that a specific interaction between a loop 2 adenosine and helical stem 1 makes a measurable contribution to pseudoknot stability...|$|R

A newly emerged virus often loses fitness in the original host. Such fitness trade-offs prevent continuous expansion of host ranges and explain why host ranges of viruses are limited. Even though viral mu-tations critical for adaptation to new hosts have been identified in many instances, little is known about how these mutations lead to the trade-offs (2, 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Nicotiana tabacum L. {{was chosen}} as an {{experimental}} plant for several practical reasons. The plants were grown in large pots in a glasshouse at 22 °C and great humidity in February-March and September-October until 4 normal leaves were present.

It {{was not until the}} work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Mosaic</b> Virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation {{of a wide range of}} microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.|$|E

The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the <b>tobacco</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E
40|$|Movement protein binding 2 C (MPB 2 C) is a plant {{endogenous}} microtubule-associated protein previously {{identified as}} an interaction partner of <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana tabacum) <b>mosaic</b> virus movement protein (TMV-MP). In this work, the role of MPB 2 C in cell-to-cell transport of TMV-MP, viral spread of TMV, and subcellular localization of TMV-MP was examined. To this end, plants with reduced MPB 2 C levels were generated by a gene-silencing strategy. Local and systemic spread of TMV and cell-to-cell movement of TMV-MP were unimpaired in MPB 2 C-silenced plants as compared to nonsilenced plants, indicating that MPB 2 C is not required for intercellular transport of TMV-MP itself or spread of TMV. However, a clear change in subcellular distribution of TMV-MP characterized by a nearly complete loss of microtubular localization was observed in MPB 2 C-silenced plants. This result shows that the MPB 2 C is a central player in determining the complex subcellular localization of TMV-MP, in particular its microtubular accumulation, a phenomenon that has been frequently observed and whose role is still under discussion. Clearly, MPB 2 C mediated accumulation of TMV-MP at microtubules is not required for intercellular spread but may be a means to withdraw the TMV-MP from the cell-to-cell transport pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{variability}} {{and genetic}} structure of <b>tobacco</b> mild green <b>mosaic</b> tobamovirus (TMGMV) was analyzed {{in a collection}} of isolates fromNicotiana glaucaplants from Australia, California, Spain, and the east Mediterranean Basin. Ribonuclease protection was assayed on 53 isolates with six probes representing 85 % of the TMGMV genome. Results showed that conserved domains in the TMGMV genome were different for each geographic population. The nucleotide sequence of two regions of the TMGMV genome was determined for 33 isolates. Nucleotide diversity values were smaller than those reported for other RNA genomes. For each population, genetic diversity was not related {{to the size of the}} area from which the isolates were collected, and was particularly small for Australia and Spain. Diversity values indicated population differentiation, which was largest between the less diverse Spanish and Australian populations. Nucleotide diversity values for nonsynonymous vs synonymous positions indicate moderate negative selection, except for the Spanish population for which it gave evidence of positive selection. On the whole, our data indicate that the low genetic diversity for this plant virus may be due to different factors such as positive and negative selection or the recent colonization of new areas or host plants. The intensity of these factors appears to be different for the various TMGMV geographical populations...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{specific}} and sensitive PCR-based procedures for simultaneous detection of economically important plant seed infection pathogenic bacteria and virus, Xanthomonns campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm), Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Ecc), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and <b>Tobacco</b> mild green <b>mosaic</b> virus (TMGMV) in pepper and tomato seeds. Most of pepper and tomato bacterial and virus diseases are responsible for germination and growth obstruction. PCR with arbitral primers: selection of specific primers, performance of PCR with specific primers and determination of the threshold level for pathogens detection. To detect simultaneously the Xcv, Cmm, Ecc, PMMoV and TMGMV in pepper and tomato seeds, five pairs (Cmm-F/R, Ecc-F/R, Xcv-F/R, PMMoV-F/R, TMGMV-F/R) of specific primer were synthesized by primer-blast program. The multiplex PCR for the five pathogens in pepper and tomato seeds could detect specially without interference among primers and/or cDNA of plant seeds and other plant pathogens.

40|$|Any {{individual}} virus can infect only {{a limited}} range of hosts, and most plant species are “nonhosts” to a given virus; i. e., {{all members of the}} species are insusceptible to the virus. In nonhost plants, the factors that control virus resistance are not genetically tractable, and how the host range of a virus is determined remains poorly understood. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a nonhost species for <b>Tobacco</b> mild green <b>mosaic</b> virus (TMGMV) and Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), members of the genus Tobamovirus. Previously, we identified Tm- 1, a resistance gene of tomato to another tobamovirus, Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), and found that Tm- 1 binds to ToMV replication proteins to inhibit RNA replication. Tm- 1 is derived from a wild tomato species, S. habrochaites, and ToMV-susceptible tomato cultivars have the allelic gene tm- 1. The tm- 1 protein can neither bind to ToMV replication proteins nor inhibit ToMV multiplication. Here, we show that transgenic tobacco plants expressing tm- 1 exhibit resistance to TMGMV and PMMoV. The tm- 1 protein bound to the replication proteins of TMGMV and PMMoV and inhibited their RNA replication in vitro. In one of the tm- 1 -expressing tobacco plants, a tm- 1 -insensitive TMGMV mutant emerged. In tomato protoplasts, this mutant TMGMV multiplied as efficiently as ToMV. However, in tomato plants, the mutant TMGMV multiplied with lower efficiency compared to ToMV and caused systemic necrosis. These results suggest that an inhibitory interaction between the replication proteins and tm- 1 underlies a multilayered resistance mechanism to TMGMV in tomato...|$|R

Among five leafhopper-transmitted g miniviruses, beet curly top and tobacco yellow dwarf viruses were distantly related but no relationship was detected between either chloris striate mosaic, maize streak or wheat dwarf viruses {{and any of}} the other four. No relationship was detected between any whitefly-transmitted and any leafhopper-transmitted virus. A similar pattern of relationships was found by spot hybridization experiments in which extracts from infected leaves were tested with probes for ACMV DNA- 1 or DNA- 2. Imperfect nucleotide sequence homologies were found between ACMV DNA- 1, which contains the particle protein gene, and the DNA of five other whitefly-transmitted viruses: bean golden mosaic, tomato golden <b>mosaic,</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaf curl, tomato leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl, the last three of which are not sap-transmissible. Thus, relationships were established between sap-transmissible and sap non-transmissible g miniviruses. No homologies were d tected with a full-length probe for ACMV DNA- 2. Extracts from plants infected with three teafhopper- transmitted viruses (beet curly top, maize streak and wheat dwarf) did not react with probes for ACMV DNA- 1 or DNA- 2. Because each of the leafhopper-transmitted geminiviruses has a different vector species whereas the whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses all have the same vector, Bemisia tabaci, the genome homologies and antigenic relationships detected among members of the group could be explained if their coat proteins have a key role in transmission by vectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} tables {{outline the}} procedures recommended {{for the detection}} of viruses of small fruit crops in the genera, Fragaria, Humulus, Ribes, Rubus and Vaccinium. In cases where a test needs validation it is recommended that an additional test be performed on the test plants. These tests that need validation have only been used on one or a few isolates of a virus. Before they can be recommended tests they need to be evaluated on a broad range of isolates from multiple locations. In the case of polymerase chain reaction assays it is necessary to state primer sequences that {{have been shown to be}} useful for detecting a wide range of virus isolates when recommending a test. Only a subset of a virus sequence is likely to be highly conserved and suitable for detecting all strains of a virus. This is also true for monoclonal antibodies that will be recommended for ELISA tests. Some monoclonal antibodies will be strain specific as has been shown for tomato ringspot, <b>tobacco</b> streak, cucumber <b>mosaic</b> etc. In some cases, polyclonal antisera must be designated as well since strain specificity can be a problem with some polyclonal antibodies, this is notably so with many nepoviruses. At the meetings in Valencia, Spain in 2003, it was decided that a standard protocol should be used to validate new testing procedures before they are listed as recommended procedures. This protocol would apply to new biological indicators, serological assays or nucleic acid based assays. The data set that will be required before a new test is recommended is given in the Proceedings of the Tree Fruit Symposium from the meetings in Spain.
