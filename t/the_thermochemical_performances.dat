40|$|For the {{thermochemical}} performance {{implementation of}} Mg(OH) 2 as a heat storage medium, several hybrid materials have been investigated. For this study, high-performance hybrid materials {{have been developed}} by exploiting the authors’ previous findings. Expanded graphite (EG) /carbon nanotubes (CNTs) -Mg(OH) 2 hybrid materials have been prepared through Mg(OH) 2 deposition-precipitation over functionalized, i. e., oxidized, or un-functionalized EG or CNTs. The heat storage performances of the carbon-based hybrid materials have been investigated through a laboratory-scale experimental simulation of the heat storage/release cycles, carried out by a thermogravimetric apparatus. This study offers a critical evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>thermochemical</b> <b>performances</b> of developed materials through their comparison in terms of heat storage and output capacities per mass and volume unit. It was demonstrated that both EG and CNTs improves <b>the</b> <b>thermochemical</b> <b>performances</b> of the storage medium in terms of reaction rate and conversion with respect to pure Mg(OH) 2. With functionalized EG/CNTs-Mg(OH) 2, (i) the potential heat storage and output capacities per mass unit of Mg(OH) 2 have been completely exploited; and (ii) higher heat storage and output capacities per volume unit were obtained.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the hydrodynamic behaviour and <b>the</b> <b>thermochemical</b> <b>performance</b> of biomass and coal blends in a Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB) riser. This is the first practical experience of using this type of rig in Malaysia. Hydrodynamic studies were conducted in the rectangular riser section of a cold circulating fluidised bed test rig. Core annulus flow structure was found in the riser while the axial voidage distribution in the riser ranged from 0. 58 - 0. 90 for the primary air flow ranging from 0. 0076 to 0. 020 m 3 /sec. Pyrolysis studies of oil palm shell waste, empty fruit bunches, rice husk, Silantek coal, Merit Pila coal, and Mukah coal and its blends with palm shell waste were carried out using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA analyses suggested that there is an obvious lateral shift in the thermograms for different heating rates. From the differential thermogravimetric curves (DTG), it was found that the pyrolysis of oil palm shell waste is pure reaction kinetics controlled. The kinetic studies were done for all the biomass and coal blends. For palm shell waste powders, it was found that the particle size and heating rates affect the activation energies that ranged from 98. 3 - 124. 4 kJ/mole while for different types of Malaysian coals, the activation energies ranged from 110. 6 - 138. 8 kJ/mole. The activation energies for Mukah coal/palm shell blends ranged from 80. 8 - 100. 8 kJ/mole for a blending ratio of 10 - 50 percent. Combustion studies for empty fruit bunches, palm shell wastes and coal blends were also carried out in a hot circulating fluidised bed test rig. The temperature dependence on the combustion process and emission behaviour was identified. The effects of varying the primary air and feed rate have also been analysed and their influence on emissions has been established. It was found that NOx and CO decreased with the percentage increase in the blending ratio. The optimum blending percent was found to be in the ratio of 40 percent Mukah coal and 60 percent palm shell waste. ...|$|R

Dopant concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 mol % have been investigated and thermally cycled at reduction temperatures of 1773 K and oxidation temperatures ranging from 873 to 1073 K by thermogravimetry. The degree of reduction of Hf and Zr doped materials is substantially higher than those of pure ceria and Sc doped ceria and increases with dopant concentration. Overall, 10 mol % Hf doped ceria results in the largest CO yields per mole of oxide (∼ 0. 5 mass % versus 0. 35 mass % for pure ceria) based on measured mass changes during oxidation. However, these yields were largely influenced by their rate of reoxidation, not necessarily thermodynamic limitations, as equilibrium was not achieved for either Hf or Zr doped samples after 45 min exposure to CO 2 at all oxidation temperatures. Additionally, sample preparation and grain size strongly affected the oxidation rates and subsequent yields, resulting in slightly decreasing yields as the samples were cycled up to 10 times. X-ray diffraction, Raman, FT-IR, and UV/vis spectroscopy in combination with SEM-EDX have been applied to characterize the elemental, crystalline, and morphological attributes before and after redox reactions...|$|R
