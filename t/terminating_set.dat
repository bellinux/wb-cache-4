5000|$|For example, a {{4-wire circuit}} may, {{by means of}} a 4-wire <b>terminating</b> <b>set,</b> be {{connected}} to a 2-wire telephone set. Also, a pair of 4-wire terminating sets may be used to introduce an intermediate 4-wire circuit into a 2-wire circuit, in which loop repeaters may be situated to amplify signals in each direction without positive feedback and oscillation.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} of a {{voiceband}} hybrid coil is to convert between 2-wire and 4-wire operation in sequential sections of a communications circuit, for example in a four-wire <b>terminating</b> <b>set.</b> Such conversion was necessary when repeaters were introduced in a 2-wire circuit, a frequent practice at early 20th century telephony. Without hybrids, the output of one amplifier feeds directly into the input of the other, resulting in a howling situation (upper diagram). By using hybrids, the outputs and inputs are isolated, resulting in correct 2-wire repeater operation. Late in the century, this practice became rare but hybrids continued in use in line cards.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{two-wire}} circuit {{is characterized by}} supporting transmission in two directions simultaneously, as opposed to four-wire circuits, which have separate pairs for transmit and receive. In either case they are twisted pairs. Telephone lines are almost all two wire, while trunks and switching are almost entirely four wire. To communicate in both directions in the same wire pair, conversion between four-wire and two-wire is necessary, both at the telephone and at the central office. A hybrid coil accomplishes the conversion for both. At the central office, {{it is part of}} a four-wire <b>terminating</b> <b>set,</b> more often as part of a line card.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn equational {{formula is}} a first-order formula over an {{alphabet}} F of function symbols and the equality predicate. Such formulae are interpreted in the algebraT(F) of ground terms. A unification problem is an equational formula {{which does not}} contain negation (in particular no disequation). We give a <b>terminating</b> <b>set</b> of transformation rules such that a formula is semantically equivalent to a unification problem iff its irreducible form is a unification problem. More precisely, our set of transformation rules computes a finite complete set of most general unifiers for an equational formula each time such a finite set exists, thus extending the results of Lassez and Marriott on explicit representation of terms defined by counter examples. We extend the above results also to equational formulae interpreted inT(F) /=E, the quotient of the free algebra by a congruence generated by a setEof shallow permutative equations (commutative axioms are a particular case) ...|$|E
40|$|Knuth-Bendix {{completion}} is {{a classical}} calculus in automated deduction for transforming {{a set of}} equations into a confluent and <b>terminating</b> <b>set</b> of directed equations {{which can be used}} to decide the induced equational theory. Multi-completion with termination tools constitutes an approach that differs from the classical method in two respects: (1) external termination tools replace the reduction order-a typically critical parameter-as proposed by Wehrman et al. (2006), and (2) multi-completion as introduced by Kurihara and Kondo (1999) is used to keep track of multiple orientations in parallel while exploiting sharing to boost efficiency. In this paper we describe the inference system, give the full proof of its correctness and comment on completeness issues. Critical pair criteria and isomorphisms are presented as refinements together with all proofs. We furthermore describe the implementation of our approach in the tool mkbTT, present extensive experimental results and report on new completions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Knuth-Bendix {{completion}} {{algorithm is}} a procedure which generates confluent and <b>terminating</b> <b>sets</b> of rewrite rules. The algorithm has many applications: the resulting rules {{can be used}} as a decision procedure for equality or, in the case of program synthesis, as a program. We present an effective algorithm to solve some cases of divergence in the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm, starting from a grammar characterising the infinite rule set. We replace an infinite set of rewrite rules by a finite complete set by enriching the original (order-sorted) signature with new sorts and new operator arities, while remaining within a conservative extension of the original system and within the original term set. The complexity of the new rewriting system is no worse than that of the original system. We characterise the class of examples for which this approach is applicable and give some sufficient conditions for the algorithm to succeed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a constrained equational logic where the constraints are membership conditions t∈swheresis {{interpreted as a}} regular tree language. Our logic includes a fragment of second-order equational logic (without projections) where second-order variables range over regular sets of contexts. The problem with constrained equational logics is {{the failure of the}} critical pair lemma. This is the reason why we propose new deduction rules for which the critical pair lemma is restored. Computing critical pairs requires, however, solving some constraints in a second-order logic with membership constraints. In a second paper we give a <b>terminating</b> <b>set</b> of transformation rules for these formulas, which decides the existence of a solution, thus showing a new term scheme unification algorithm. Since an order-sorted signature is nothing but a bottom–up tree automaton, order-sorted equational logic falls into the scope of our study; our results show how to perform order-sorted completion without regularity and without sort-decreasingness. It also shows how to perform unification in the order-sorted case, with some higher-order variables (without any regularity assumption) ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{new ideas}} are {{presented}} on graph reduction applied to graphs with bounded treewidth.

Also, the existence is shown of finite, safe, complete, and <b>terminating</b> <b>sets</b> of reduction rules, such that on any graph G with treewidth at most some constant k,Ω (n) applications of reduction rules can be applied simultaneously. This result is used to obtain a class of randomized parallel algorithms that solve many problems on graphs with bounded treewidth and bounded degree in O(log n) expected time with O(n) processors on a EREW PRAM. Among others, such an algorithm is obtained to recognize the class of graphs with treewidth at most k and maximum vertex degree at most d, for constant k and d...|$|R
