40|$|This {{work was}} {{designed}} to determine <b>the</b> influence of <b>tributes</b> on <b>the</b> optimum economical age of harvestingEucalyptus spp. stands, {{to determine the number}} of cuttings between the reform of Eucalyptus spp. stands, to determine and analyzethe contribution of <b>tributes</b> to <b>the</b> wood production costs. Many tributes are due on the forest sector. In this study, the tributesconsidered are the ones falling on the production of forest on products and services (TMS), income tax on businessoperation (ITJP), social raw material, not including, therefore, those which are due on industrialization. They are: forestrate (FR), cadastrum and registration rate (CRR), chainsaw record rate (MRR), chainsaw ownership tax (MPT), landownership tax (RTT), commercialization tax contribution on profit (SCP), contribution for financing of social security(CFSS), Contribution for the National Institute of Social Security (CNISS), contribution for the social integration program(CSIP), rural syndicate contribution (RSH). The criterion utilized to determine economic rotation and to determine theoptimum moment to renew the stand was the Net Present Value (NPV), considering an infinite planning horizon. The resultsobtained allowed to identify the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>tributes</b> in <b>the</b> total wood production cost [...] It was found that the optimumharvesting time, not considering <b>the</b> <b>tributes,</b> occurred at 7 years o age; considering all <b>the</b> <b>tributes,</b> <b>the</b> optimum age occurredat 8 years. By not considering tributes would cause to unduly anticipate the optimum harvesting age. The optimum momentto make the renewal of the stand, not considering <b>the</b> <b>tributes,</b> occurred at 21 years, after the third cutting. However,taking into account <b>the</b> <b>tributes,</b> it would occur at 32 years (after the fourth cutting). By not considering the effect oftributation would cause one to unduly antecipate the optimum time to renew the stand. Tributation stands for 37. 78 % ofwood production cost, i. e., taxes contribute with 3. 8 %, imposts with 25. 32 % and contributions with 8. 99 %...|$|R
