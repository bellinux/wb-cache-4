5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sperm</b> whale's {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> whale has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E
5|$|The genital {{openings}} (gonopores) of {{both sexes}} are located {{on the underside of}} the third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two penes which deposit <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. Millipede sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sperm</b> whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. <b>The</b> <b>sperm</b> whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E

5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|Atop the whale's skull is {{positioned}} a large complex of organs {{filled with a}} liquid mixture of fats and waxes called spermaceti. The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds, which <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> whale uses for echolocation and communication.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs, {{which are}} aquatic, use {{external}} fertilization, {{in other words}} <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> and ova meet outside the parents' bodies. Their trilobite-like larvae look rather like miniature adults as they have full sets of appendages and eyes, but initially they have only two pairs of book-gills and gain three more pairs as they molt.|$|E
50|$|Most first ejaculations (90 percent) lack <b>sperm.</b> Of <b>the</b> few early ejaculations that do contain <b>sperm,</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of <b>sperm</b> (97%) lack motion. <b>The</b> remaining <b>sperm</b> (3%) have abnormal motion.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> human <b>sperm</b> cell is <b>the</b> {{reproductive}} cell in males and will only survive in warm environments; once {{it leaves the}} male body <b>the</b> <b>sperm's</b> survival likelihood is reduced and it may die, thereby decreasing <b>the</b> total <b>sperm</b> quality. Sperm cells come in two types, [...] "female" [...] and [...] "male". Sperm cells {{that give rise to}} female (XX) offspring after fertilization differ in that they carry an X-chromosome, while sperm cells that give rise to male (XY) offspring carry a Y-chromosome.|$|R

5|$|In caecilians, {{fertilisation}} is internal, {{the male}} extruding an intromittent organ, the phallodeum, and inserting {{it into the}} female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish <b>the</b> <b>sperm.</b> Fertilisation probably {{takes place in the}} oviduct.|$|E
5|$|In males, the semen {{is forming}} in the testis. <b>The</b> <b>sperm</b> {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the vas deferens to the penis. The penis {{is located on the}} inner side of the right tentacle.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sperm</b> whale {{belongs to}} the order Cetartiodactyla, the order {{containing}} all cetaceans and even-toed ungulates. It {{is a member of}} the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, Physeter, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus Kogia, the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps and the dwarf sperm whale K. simus, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> whale family).|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say much}} on that point: I only know that, when a sperm whale is killed, they make oil {{out of the}} fat part as they do of ours; but <b>the</b> <b>Sperms</b> {{have a sort of}} cistern in their heads, full of stuff like cream, and rose-colored. They cut a hole in the skull, and dip it out; and {{sometimes}} get sixteen or twenty barrels. This is made into what you call spermaceti candles.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>sperm's</b> crucial {{function}} is to locate and fuse with a mature oocyte. Under laboratory conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans sperm are very efficient at navigating the hermaphrodite reproductive tract and locating oocytes. Here, we identify chemosensory and oxygen-sensing circuits that affect <b>the</b> <b>sperm's</b> navigational capacity. Multiple Serpentine Receptor B (SRB) chemosensory receptors regulate Gα pathways in gustatory sensory neurons that extend cilia through the male nose. SRB signaling is necessary and sufficient in these sensory neurons to influence <b>sperm</b> motility parameters. <b>The</b> neuropeptide Y pathway acts together with SRB- 13 to antagonize negative effects of the GCY- 35 hyperoxia sensor on spermatogenesis. SRB chemoreceptors are not essential for sperm navigation under low oxygen conditions that C. elegans prefers. In ambient oxygen environments, SRB- 13 signaling impacts gene expression during spermatogenesis and <b>the</b> <b>sperm's</b> mitochondria, thereby increasing migration velocity and inhibiting reversals within the hermaphrodite uterus. The SRB- 13 transcriptome is highly enriched in genes implicated in pathogen defense, {{many of which are}} expressed in diverse tissues. We show that the critical time period for SRB- 13 signaling is prior to spermatocyte differentiation. Our results support the model that young C. elegans males sense external environment and oxygen tension, triggering long-lasting downstream signaling events with effects on <b>the</b> <b>sperm's</b> mitochondria and navigational capacity. Environmental exposures early in male life may alter sperm function and fertility...|$|R
40|$|Postcopulatory sexual {{selection}} {{is thought to}} be a potent evolutionary force driving <b>the</b> diversification of <b>sperm</b> shape and function across species. In birds, insemination and fertilisation are separated in time and <b>sperm</b> storage increases <b>the</b> duration of <b>sperm</b> female interaction and hence <b>the</b> opportunity for <b>sperm</b> competition and cryptic female choice. We performed a comparative study of 24 pheasant species (Phasianidae, Galliformes) to establish the relative importance of <b>sperm</b> competition and <b>the</b> duration of <b>sperm</b> storage for <b>the</b> evolution of <b>sperm</b> morphometry (i. e. size of different sperm traits). We found that sperm size traits were negatively associated with <b>the</b> duration of <b>sperm</b> storage but were independent of <b>the</b> risk of <b>sperm</b> competition estimated from relative testis mass. Our study emphasises the importance of female reproductive biology for <b>the</b> evolution of <b>sperm</b> morphometry particularly in sperm storing taxa. ...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sperm</b> whale {{characteristically}} has a large, squarish head {{one-third the}} length of its body; the blowhole is slightly to the left hand side; the skin is usually wrinkled; and it has no teeth on the upper jaw.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sperm</b> whale is a {{prominent}} user of echolocation and communication, with vocalization {{as loud as}} 230 decibels (re 1 µPa at 1 m) underwater. It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live for more than 60 years.|$|E

40|$|Industrial and {{technological}} advances {{have brought a}} great benefit in human life, but these also bring negative effects to human and environment. Several toxic agents often influence human health, {{one of them is}} lead which give toxic effect on male reproductive  system. Lead can cause male infertility through two main mechanisms. First, lead reduces the mannose receptors so that <b>the</b> <b>sperms</b> are unable to conduct the acrosome recation, or cause premature acrosome reaction. Secondly, lead competes with zinc in binding protamine, as the result, it will interfere the chromatin stability of <b>the</b> <b>sperms</b> which are closely related to  male fertility.    ...|$|R
30|$|Another {{interpretation}} of decreased sperm count {{may be due}} to ω- 6 which affects spermatogenesis, by the incorporation into spermatozoa cell membrane so that the disruption of spermatogenesis at any stage of cell differentiation can decrease <b>the</b> total <b>sperm</b> count, increase <b>the</b> abnormal <b>sperm</b> count, and impair <b>the</b> stability of <b>sperm</b> chromatin or damage sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Mangelsdorf, Buschmann, & Orthen, 2003).|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{motility}} {{analysis has}} a particular place in male fertility diagnosis. Computerized sperm tracking has {{an important role in}} extracting sperm trajectory and measuring sperm’s dynamic features. Due to free movements of sperms in three dimensions, occlusion has remained a chal-lenging problem in this area. This paper aims to present a robust single sperm tracking method being able to handle misdetections in sperm occlusion scenes. In this paper, a robust method of segmentation was utilized to provide the required measurements for a switchable weight particle filtering which was designed for single sperm tracking. In each frame, <b>the</b> target <b>sperm</b> was categorized in one of these three stages: before occlusion, occlusion, and after occlusion where the occlusion had been detected based on sperm’s physical characteristics. Depending on <b>the</b> target <b>sperm</b> stage, particles were weighted differently. In order to evaluate the algorithm, two groups of samples were studied where an expert had selected a single sperm of each sample to track manually and automatically. In the first group, <b>the</b> <b>sperms</b> with no occlusion along their trajectories were tracked to depict the general compatibility of <b>the</b> algorithm with <b>sperm</b> tracking. In <b>the</b> second group, the algorithm was applied on <b>the</b> <b>sperms</b> which had at least one occlusion during their path...|$|R
5|$|There {{is little}} data {{regarding}} <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> content of pre-ejaculatory fluid. While some tentative research {{did not find}} sperm, one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers. The withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3% of couples.|$|E
5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (spermatophore) in a receptacle {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). <b>The</b> <b>sperm,</b> when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore {{may be at the}} end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
40|$|The {{freezing}} and thawing process {{not only is}} associated with serious damage to sperm such as damage to the plasma membrane and the acrosomal membrane but also changes the membrane permeability to some ions including calcium. Also, the generation of oxygen free radicals is increased during the freezing-thawing process. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate of the effects of Trolox as an antioxidant and edetic acid (EDTA) as a calcium chelator on frozen-thawed (FT) sperm and compare these effects with those on fresh sperm. This study was done on these men of 25 healthy men, who referred to Shiraz Infertility Centerbetween 2012 and 2013. Normal samples were transferred to the ReproductivePhysiology Laboratory, Department of Physiology,Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz. The samples were divided into two groups randomly: fresh and FT sperm groups. Each group was divided into five subgroups: control group, the solvent group (0. 1 %dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), Trolox group (200 μM), EDTA group (1. 1 mM), and Trolox+EDTA group. The percentages of motility, viability, and acrosome-reacted <b>sperm</b> were tested. <b>The</b> percentages of motility and viability in <b>the</b> FT <b>sperm</b> were lower than those in <b>the</b> fresh <b>sperm.</b> <b>The</b> progressive motility of <b>the</b> FT <b>sperm</b> was improved nonsignificantly with Trolox+EDTA. However, the effect of Trolox+EDTA on the progressive motility of <b>the</b> FT <b>sperm</b> was much more than that on <b>the</b> fresh <b>sperm.</b> <b>The</b> fewest acrosome-reacted <b>sperm</b> were observed in <b>the</b> EDTA-containingFT <b>sperm.</b> Antioxidant supplementation or omission of extracellular calcium may partly improve motility and also reduce acrosomal damage in FT sperm...|$|R
5000|$|Some prosobranch {{gastropods}} (snails) produce two {{or three}} <b>sperm</b> types. <b>The</b> infertile types may be large [...] "carrier" [...] types <b>the</b> fertile <b>sperm</b> attach to for transport, or [...] "lancet" [...] types. <b>The</b> lancet <b>sperm</b> sometimes contain many lysosomes.|$|R
50|$|Oviparous species show {{relatively}} larger {{testes and}} sperm midpiece length than viviparous species because oviparous species often reproduce annually {{as opposed to}} the bi annual cycle of the viviparous species. Because the oviparous species reproduce less frequently, these traits may have been selected to generate stronger propulsions, develop more mitochondria and increase <b>the</b> amount of <b>sperm</b> per ejaculate to help aid in <b>the</b> <b>sperms</b> success rate.|$|R
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>sperm.</b> The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick {{is based}} on a true story about a sperm whale that {{attacked}} and sank the whaleship Essex. Melville associated <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> whale with the Bible's Leviathan. The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales' ability to fiercely defend themselves from attacks by early whalers, occasionally resulting in the destruction of the whaling ships.|$|E
5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which <b>the</b> <b>sperm</b> from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E
5000|$|Following <b>The</b> <b>Sperm's</b> breakup in <b>the</b> early 1970s, Airaksinen {{turned to}} Buddhism and ceased making music. He {{returned}} to {{music in the}} mid 1980s with his album Buddhas of Golden Light, which mixed free jazz with percussion from a Roland 808 drum machine.|$|R
50|$|There is {{correlational}} {{evidence for}} this theory in a butterfly, Pieris napi. Females that were receptive to a second mating had fewer of <b>the</b> non-fertile <b>sperm</b> type in storage than did non-receptive females. Thus, <b>the</b> infertile <b>sperm</b> {{may be responsible for}} delaying female remating.|$|R
50|$|Semen {{displacement}} has {{two main}} benefits for a male. Firstly, by displacing a rival male's <b>sperm,</b> <b>the</b> risk of <b>the</b> rival <b>sperm</b> fertilising <b>the</b> egg is reduced, thus minimising <b>the</b> risk of <b>sperm</b> competition. Secondly, <b>the</b> male replaces <b>the</b> rival's <b>sperm</b> with his own, therefore increasing his own chance of fertilising {{the egg and}} successfully reproducing with the female. However, males have to ensure they do not displace their own sperm. It is thought that the relatively quick loss of erection after ejaculation, penile hypersensitivity following ejaculation, and the shallower, slower thrusting of the male after ejaculation, prevents this from occurring.|$|R
