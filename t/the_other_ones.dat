5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory {{can be thought of}} as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ones,</b> too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, {{along with}} several other musicians, formed a band called <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Ones,</b> and {{performed}} a number of concerts that year, releasing a live album, The Strange Remain, the following year. In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Ones</b> toured again, this time with Kreutzmann but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band toured again in 2002 with Lesh. That year, <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Ones</b> then included all four living former Grateful Dead members {{who had been in}} the band for most or all of its history. At different times the shifting lineup of <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Ones</b> also included guitarists Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, and Jimmy Herring, keyboardists Bruce Hornsby, Jeff Chimenti, and Rob Barraco, saxophonist Dave Ellis, drummer John Molo, bassist Alphonso Johnson, and vocalist Susan Tedeschi.|$|E

60|$|If {{speculation}} tends thus to {{a terrific}} unity, {{in which all}} things are absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is the course of gravitation of mind; {{the second is the}} power of nature. Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many. <b>One</b> is being; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> intellect; <b>one</b> is necessity; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> freedom; <b>one,</b> rest; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> motion; <b>one,</b> power; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> distribution; <b>one,</b> strength; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> pleasure; <b>one,</b> consciousness; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> definition; <b>one,</b> genius; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> talent, <b>one,</b> earnestness; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> knowledge; <b>one,</b> possession; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> trade; <b>one,</b> caste; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> culture; <b>one</b> king; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> democracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher, and name the last tendency of both, we might say, {{that the end of the}} one is escape from organization,--pure science; and the end of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is <b>the</b> highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive deity.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{multiple}} developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various Stargate productions {{are not entirely}} consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official canon, the largest following exists for the three live-action series.

25|$|The {{complexity}} of the figure of Juno has caused much uncertainty and debate among modern scholars.

25|$|Nest refoundation by colonies that {{lose the}} {{original}} one is pretty common, and allows this species of wasps {{to thrive in}} highly disturbed landscapes, that face frequent fires or other disturbances. When the nest is destroyed or goes lost, the swarm just moves to a near point (a branch or else) and begins another nest. Sometimes, when {{there are lots of}} wasps, the swarm may break up and create several new little nests. Only the one with the foundress in it will produce female offspring and complete the cycle, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ones</b> will end up producing worker males. If one of those secondary nests is lost, its workers will rather rejoin a near group of other sisters instead of trying to found it again.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the game in Manipur are traced to early {{precursors}} of Sagol Kangjei. This was one of three forms of hockey in Manipur, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ones</b> being field hockey (called Khong Kangjei) and wrestling-hockey (called Mukna Kangjei). Local rituals such as those connected to the Marjing, the Winged-Pony God of Polo and the creation-ritual episodes of the Lai Haraoba festival enacting the life of his son, Khori-Phaba, the polo-playing god of sports. These may indicate an origin earlier than the historical records of Manipur. Later, according to Chaitharol-Kumbaba, a Royal Chronicle of Manipur King Kangba who ruled Manipur much earlier than Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (33AD) introduced Sagol Kangjei (Kangjei on horse back). Further regular playing of this game commenced in 1605 during the reign of King Khagemba under newly framed rules of the game. However it was the first Mughal emperor, Babur, who popularised the sport in India and ultimately made a significant influence on England.|$|E

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it.

That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ones.</b> It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes.
