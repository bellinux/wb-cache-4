6000|$|... "Aha! Talk {{about trying}} to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got <b>to</b> go <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> <b>to</b> {{the middle of the}} woods, where you know there's a spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say: ...|$|R

But {{you would have to}} say good-bye <b>to</b> <b>all</b> your own people and come and be my {{constant}} companion in this ruined castle. There is one habitable room in it, {{in which there is a}} golden bed; there you will have <b>to</b> live <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> and don't forget that whatever you may see or hear in the night you must not scream out, for if you give as much as a single cry my sufferings will be doubled.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Bessie Smail sleuthed {{out this}} anarchy. She yammered, [...] "Why, Carrie, you ain't going <b>to</b> sleep <b>all</b> alone <b>by</b> <b>yourself?</b> I don't believe in that. Married folks {{should have the}} same room, of course! Don't go getting silly notions. No telling what a thing like that might lead to. Suppose I up and told your Uncle Whit that I wanted a room of my own!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, luckless being!' sighed the girl; 'how {{will you}} ever get through with it. The white horse, who is our master's grandmother, is always hungry: it takes twenty men always mowing {{to keep it in}} food for one day, and another twenty to clean out its stall. How, then, do you expect <b>to</b> do it <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself?</b> But listen <b>to</b> me, and do what I tell you. It is your only chance. When you have filled the manger as full as it will hold you must weave a strong plait of the rushes which grow among the meadow hay, and cut a thick peg of stout wood, and be sure that the horse sees what you are doing. Then it will ask you what it is for, and you will say, 'With this plait I intend to bind up your mouth so that you cannot eat any more, and with this peg I am going to keep you still in one spot, so that you cannot scatter your corn and water all over the place!' After these words the maiden went away as softly as she had come.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} it's wise," [...] I asked, [...] "to be <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> {{at night in}} such a lonely house as yours? Why don't you have a manservant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, here's Dad!" [...] she exclaimed, flinging {{her arms}} around his neck. [...] "Daddy, how dare you be sitting here <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> whilst we are having dinner! When did you get back? What a fish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might take}} it, {{if you were}} not a stranger," [...] she said. [...] "Why don't you tell us who you are, and what your reason is for living <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> in this dull place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your gran'mother's in her bed. Wipe {{your shoes}} well if you're goin' up, and don't go burstin' {{in on her}} like a skyrocket. My word, but that's a fine posy! Did you do it <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> an' all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ah!' she said, 'I {{know why}} you're sitting here, and fretting, <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself.</b> The {{best thing that}} can happen for your advantage, Rosanna, will be for Mr. Franklin's visit here to come to an end.

6000|$|... "Your wheel {{does seem}} to be a sort of a companion," [...] she said; [...] "not so good as a horse, but better than nothing. I should think, {{travelling}} <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> in this way, you would have quite a friendly feeling for it. Did you ever think of giving it a name?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Uncle Billy. He {{slipped out}} of the door, and ran like a deer to the waiting carriage. Thrusting a twenty-dollar gold-piece into the coachman's hand, he said hoarsely, [...] "I ain't wantin' that kerridge just now; ye ken drive around and hev a private jamboree <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself</b> the rest of the afternoon, and then come and wait for me at the top o' the hill yonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And pray {{what are}} you, Constance?" [...] {{retorted}} the other. [...] "A fair divided excellence or an excellence <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself,</b> or what? If you find pleasure in contemplating a deep romantic attachment, {{think a little}} more of Mr. Northcott. He is the type of a gentleman, if you like--brave and gentle, and without stain.

60|$|Strictly speaking, {{there is}} no such thing as an English Peasant. Indeed, the type can only exist in community, so much does it depend on {{cooperation}} and common laws. One must not think primarily of a French Peasant; any more than of a German Measle. The plural of the word is its proper form; you cannot have a Peasant till you have a peasantry. The essence of the Peasant ideal is equality; and you cannot be equal <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Both Seger's {{studio and}} live {{versions}} of [...] "Turn the Page" [...] feature a mellotron and a saxophone part played by founding Silver Bullet member Alto Reed. Tom Weschler allegedly helped inspire Reed {{to create the}} opening melody. During recording, Weschler told Reed: [...] "Alto, think about it like this: You're in New York City, on the Bowery. It's 3 a.m. You're under a streetlamp. There's a light mist coming down. You're <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>yourself.</b> Show me what that sounds like."
