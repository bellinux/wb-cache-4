40|$|Railways {{all over}} the world suffer from <b>track</b> <b>buckles</b> caused by {{variations}} in thermal stresses arising from temperature fluctuations due to climate. Notable studies during the 1960 s to 1980 s include Kerr, Samavedam and Kish from the Volpe Centre in the United States, Esveld from the European Railway Research Institute and Hagaman and Kathage for the Railways of Australia (ROA). Buckling and trackparameters which contribute to track instabilities have been studied and characterised comprehensively during those years. From the 1990 s, track lateral stability studies have focused on risk analysis andmanagement procedures probabilistically using software such as CWR-SAFE. Recently buckling research has been on forecasting rail temperatures. Two notable rail temperature prediction models have beendeveloped by Chapman et al. with the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board, Zhang and Lee from Ensco Inc, and Federal Railroad Administration in the United States. An advanced predictive model like that developed by Chapman for rail temperature signifies for industry the difference between blanket speed restriction procedures and focused operational management based on localised risk conditions determined using a scientific approach. This paper gives a comparative review on the models developed by Chapman et al and Zhang and Lee, and what knowledge is currently available in Australia including studies by Whittingham and, more recently, Munro. It also outlines the steps that the Australian rail industry needs to take to further develop a comprehensive track stability management system. Collating existing knowledge is the first step for the Australian railway industry to have a more compreehnsive hot weather rail management policy...|$|E
40|$|Buckling of {{railroad}} track {{continues to be}} problematic for railway engineers and maintenance personnel across all railway networks. Thermal forces are the principal longitudinal load on railroad track. In an effort to ensure track stability under dynamic loads, the magnitude to which longitudinal thermal stresses develop {{is controlled by the}} choice of an appropriate Design Neutral Temperature (DNT). The longitudinal movement of rail, referred to as creep, causes a deviation of the rails’ neutral temperature (RNT) from that of the DNT. It is crucial that the RNT is maintained at or near the DNT to provide the necessary leeway for dynamic traffic loads and ensure lateral stability of the track. However, techniques for monitoring the RNT are very limited and difficult to employ. Railway networks generally rely on preventative measures, such as track strengthening work, to control the risk of buckles occurring. This approach to managing the risk of <b>track</b> <b>buckles</b> is resource hungry and time consuming. This project develops a recursive methodology for identifying situations where the longitudinal movement of rail is likely to result in the accumulation of longitudinal stresses, which is conducive to buckling. The methodology has been developed for the Western and South-Western systems of Queensland Rail. The approach presented in this paper focuses on identifying certain trends in rail creep observed at locations that result in the development of stress condition that are conducive to buckling. The trends in the rate and extent of creep displayed at the locations and the locations’ proximity to fixed track structures are used to predict potential high stress areas...|$|E
40|$|<b>Track</b> <b>buckling</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} as a major concern for Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) since the introduction of CWR on railway networks. Both static and dynamic loadings on track can cause <b>track</b> <b>buckling.</b> <b>Track</b> can be subjected to static loads such as tensile and compressive loads due to temperature differential, and misalignment due to maintenance operations and cumulative deflections. Dynamic parameters include vehicle loading on track under differenct speeds, Net Axle Lateral to Vertical (L/V) force ratio and bogie centre spacing. A number of research studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate the effect of different parameters of <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> to establish a safety operating criteria. Railways around the world follow their own specific standards to safeguard against <b>track</b> <b>buckling.</b> However, all the studies differ in environment and operational characteristics. Hence unification of knowledge concerning different <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> parameters is important. In the present study a comparative analysis of different parameters of <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> is presented...|$|R

Each day {{the company is}} responsible for the movement of about 700, 000 tonnes of coal, iron ore and other freight across Australia. Among the challenges, <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> has been a major hurdle to overcome. Compressive stress in the hot weather periods has historically caused rails to misalign, causing delays to services, reputational impact on the coal business, and significant financial stresses on the track maintainer and budget holder. Ultimately, in a number of cases, it has also caused <b>tracks</b> to <b>buckle</b> under trains and been the direct cause of train derailments. The use in the field of using an artificial thermal method of heating rail upon installation has been deemed as a major factor and a root cause of future problems occurring. <b>Track</b> <b>buckling</b> and heat related track misalignments {{over the last five years}} have shown a significant increase. Goals are to manage and control the causes of <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> with the aim of delivering zero train derailments.

40|$|Preventing <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> is {{important}} to the railroad industry’s goal of operational safety. It is a common practice for railroads to impose slow orders during hot weather when the risk of <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> is high. Numerous factors affect <b>track</b> <b>buckling,</b> but the instantaneous rail temperatures and stress-free (neutral) rail temperatures are the most critical factors. Unfortunately, neither of these two temperatures is easily obtainable. Decisions for slow orders are often based on an arbitrary, ambient temperature limit. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development has initiated a research project to develop a model for predicting rail temperatures based on real-time meteorological forecast data. The rail temperature prediction model is based on the heat transfer process of a rail exposed to the sun. In developing such a model, a rail-weather station was established, composed of a portable weather station and a short segment of rail track with temperature sensors installed on both rails. The model has proven to be able to predict the maximum rail temperature within a few degrees and within 30 minutes of the actual time when the maximum rail temperature occurs during the day. The model is being validated for three locations where real-time weather data and rail temperature are collected. A prototype webbase...|$|R
40|$|<b>Track</b> <b>buckling</b> is {{a serious}} problem for railways. High {{longitudinal}} rail stresses contribute to many problems such as <b>track</b> <b>buckling,</b> rail joint failure, rail breakage and failure of turnouts. The direct and indirect costs of <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> problems are very high. The influences of rail temperature, SFT and lateral misalignment of <b>track</b> on <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> need comprehensive investigation. In this paper, an experimental design comprising strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress sensors has been implemented on the QR heavy haul 60 kg/m rail network. A new creep measurement technique using internal rail stress has been developed. The changes in rail neutral temperature due to the variation of actual rail temperature and the occurrence of rail creep in straight and curved track is quantified. Modes of differences of SFT in the two rails at a location, and of SFT in straight track and in curved track are discussed. The relationship of SFT to rail temperature is also presented. Daily variation in rail temperature due to ambient air temperature is presented. Field trials showed that SFT can vary by 2 - 30 C during the day. Based on this finding and the derivation of an equation for change of SFT, an improvement in utilising rail creep measurements for assessing track condition has resulted. This finding suggests {{that it is possible to}} determine the SFT throughout a day rather than just a single SFT value. This paper also presents a simple track stability management tool that is based on two major parameters, namely rail stress and track resistance. Each parameter in the tool has been given three levels of value to determine the required preventive measures. Overall, the tool decides the need for speed restriction during hot weather based on the quantified parameters from the field trials and rail standards...|$|R
40|$|<b>Track</b> <b>buckling</b> in {{continuously}} {{welded rail}} {{is a significant}} problem in the railroad industry [1 – 3]. Buckling {{is caused by the}} buildup of compressive stress (longitudinal force), which is primarily caused by an increase in rail temperature while the rail is constrained and cannot expand longitudinally. The buckling is typically manifested in the wavy lateral displacement of the track over a distance of approximately 100 feet [3]. Because buckling can cause the derailment of a passing train, extensive efforts are spent on preventive maintenance of the track. If a region of rail is known to be in a high state of compressive stress, the rail can be de-stressed by cutting it, allowing it to expand, and then welding it back together. Currently, one of the major difficulties in preventing <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> is lack of a means for detecting the highly stressed areas...|$|R

30|$|Continuously welded rails (CWRs) are an {{important}} technology in modern railway track structures. Nowadays, most new railways worldwide belong to super long continuously welded rail tracks. In addition, along with the rapid development of high-speed railways in recent years, new technologies in track structure {{have been widely used}} for ballastless tracks, large-sized welded turnouts, CWRs on long-span bridges, etc. As there is an additional longitudinal rail force caused by track-bridge interaction, it poses important challenges to preventing the expansion and breaking of CWRs, especially <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> and breakage on long-span bridges which severely threat the track structures of high-speed railways based on ballastless tracks [1, 2, 3]. In high-temperature seasons, an excessively high longitudinal tension in rail bars may cause <b>track</b> <b>buckling,</b> lifting, rail-pad shifting, part damage and malfunction, etc. In low-temperature seasons, rail bars under an excessively high longitudinal tension are likely to cause track breakage. The accurate measurement of longitudinal rail stress and rail temperature is the key to scientific evaluation, management and maintenance of CWRs [4, 5].|$|R

50|$|A {{special case}} is heat related buckling: {{in hot weather}} the rail steel expands. This is managed by {{stressing}} continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 <b>track</b> <b>buckle</b> incidents in Great Britain).|$|R
40|$|Because thermal {{expansions}} are constrained within continuous {{welded rail}} track, the <b>track</b> can <b>buckle,</b> and does so mainly in the horizontal plane. In this paper, a parametric finite element model of railway track is presented, and its sensitivity to the variations of the main parameters that characterise the scenario has been investigated and discussed. Comparison with existing literature shows good agreement. It is found that curved tracks suffer from thermal buckling more than tangent tracks do. To simulate a track misalignment defect, a new methodology has been utilised that does not introduce, as is usual, geometrical discontinuities near the same defect, because it takes into account – in a natural way – the bending stiffness of the whole railway track in the horizontal plane. To contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the safe utilisation of raw experimental data obtained from in situ tests, a deep analysis of the effects on the thermal <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> response produced by each parameter characterising the sleeper–ballast lateral resistance curve is presented and discussed. It is found that for current ballasted railway <b>tracks,</b> the minimum <b>buckling</b> temperature depends only on the limit lateral resistance, whereas a high value of the initial stiffness can lead to overestimation of the maximum buckling temperature, also taking into account the ‘natural’ decrease in the maximum buckling temperature due to an increase in the railway-traffic-induced defect amplitude...|$|R

40|$|Railway <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> occurs due to {{inadequate}} rail stress adjustment.

The main aim {{of this paper is}} to describe a 24 hour rail temperature prediction model which was developed for use in rail operations to assist in predicting adverse rail temperature conditions which could lead to or initiate <b>track</b> <b>buckling.</b> By applying predictive information, trains can be directed to travel at a regulated speed to reduce the longitudinal loading on the track. The model uses multivariate linear regression to predict the rail temperatures from the predicted weather forecast. Data from a field experiment, involving a weather station and rail temperature sensors, was statistically evaluated and compared to determine the accuracy of the rail temperature model. This paper evaluates the accuracy of i) rail temperatures predicted using only Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) weather forecasts ii) rail temperature predictions using on site weather station data, and iii) empirical weather prediction equations. Concluding results of this paper show that rail temperature can be predicted 24 hour in advance from a BoM forecasts and if calibrated properly the accuracy is within +/- 2. 6 ºC of actual rail temperatures. Real time rail temperature predictions using on site weather station data have an accuracy of +/- 4. 2 ºC; whereas empirical methods have at most an accuracy of +/- 5. 9 ºC from actual rail temperatures. The accuracy of the forecasted rail temperature prediction using BoM weather forecasts is within the magnitude of temperature sensors accuracies this is very encouraging for possibility of rail forecasting rail temperatures without the use of instrumentation...|$|R

In {{order to}} ensure the safety of running train against the <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> in a sultry weather, a speed {{reduction}} scheme has been implemented in railway operating companies.

The rational speed reduction scheme based on the probabilistic method for the buckling of the CWR track is proposed to apply to Korea high and normal speed railway. Permissible level of the reduced speed according to the rule of restricted speed signal, accepted degree of the buckling probability, the practically managing degree of the variation of the rail temperature, and effects of the maintenance work on the track condition are reflected in the rational speed reduction scheme...|$|R

Therefore, a direct stress measurement approach utilizing a probe which could be scanned continuously along the rail would be very valuable for surveying the state of rail stress {{to determine if a}} potentially unsafe condition exists. In the research described in this paper, the nonlinear harmonics (NLH) method was investigated as an approach for measuring stress in a railroad rail.

40|$|In railway applications, track {{alignment}} represents the forming {{curvature of the}} running edge of the rails. During construction, alignment measurements are normally obtained with chord measuring systems. When traditional surveying methods are implemented, {{track alignment}} is taken at sparse spaced points directly from the versine measurement – i. e., the offset observed at an intermediate point from a straight line chord. In contrast, track recording vehicles either apply the chord measuring technique directly or employ a combination of an inertial/gauge sensing system. For ballast track sections, deviations in track alignment from the projected track settlement would raise serious concerns for <b>track</b> <b>buckling.</b> This is because any deviation from the nominal geometry reduces the load needed to induce buckling. Today, modern lining systems and automated maintenance procedures are used to restore track surface and alignment. Contrary to the ballast track technique, the connection of the slab track and the underground is rigid. Consequently, adaptations to the nominal geometry after paving over are only possible with additional expenditure. As a result, positional accuracy requirements in slab track projects are very high...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of concrete sleeper becomes very important due {{to increase in}} train speed and {{development of}} the long welded rails. Due to this, it is necessary to increase the weight and the strength of the concrete sleepers to resist <b>track</b> <b>buckling</b> and reduce vibration in ballast. Modem high speed trains impart considerable amount of impact energy to the track and this also generates high frequency vibrations in the rails. Sleeper should be able to absorb the impact energy and damp vibrations to a considerable extent and transmit the balance safely to the ballast. At higher speed, the stress component of the Prestressed Concrete Sleeper developed on quasi-static response to dynamic force. This can lead to fairly high tensile stresses in sleepers and problem of concrete sleepers cracking.
