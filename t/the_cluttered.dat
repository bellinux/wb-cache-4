By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>cluttered</b> arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Miró {{joined the}} Surrealist group. The already {{symbolic}} and poetic nature of Miró’s work, {{as well as}} the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Miró’s work lost <b>the</b> <b>cluttered</b> chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as “x” in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Miró’s dream paintings.|$|E

2500|$|The Remingtons' {{substantial}} Gothic revival {{house was}} situated at 301 Webster Avenue, on a prestigious promontory known as Lathers Hill. A sweeping lawn rolled south toward Long Island Sound, providing views {{on three sides}} of the beautiful Westchester County countryside. Remington called it “Endion", an Ojibwa word meaning [...] "the place where I live." [...] In the early years, no real studio existed at [...] "Endion" [...] and Remington did most of his work in a large attic under the home's front gable where he stored materials collected on his many western excursions. Later he used his library on the main floor, a larger, more comfortable room that soon took on <b>the</b> <b>cluttered</b> appearance of an atelier. However, neither situation was completely satisfactory: the space was limited, the light was less than adequate, and the surroundings were generally uninspiring. In the spring of 1896 Remington retained the New Rochelle architect O. William Degen to plan a studio addition to the house.

2500|$|Berry's love of North Staffordshire {{was deep}} and permanent; he indulged an incurable {{addiction}} to the place. He [...] "had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by [...] "an invisible umbilical cord", which could never be cut." [...] He said of his childhood [...] "every house seemed to have an old woman, a drunken man, a gang of kids and a snarling dog."

[...] He said he had [...] "always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part", while declaring, [...] "I am a man of habit and pattern." [...] He [...] "became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands." [...] His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, [...] "when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea College of Art he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor." [...] And indeed [...] "propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable."

[...] He was [...] "a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face." [...] He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for [...] "he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me." [...] He was really [...] "a painter and poet of <b>the</b> <b>cluttered</b> and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque." [...] As a painter, he strained [...] "to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away." [...] He felt his paintings to be [...] "the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut." [...] This was indeed [...] "a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to."

60|$|This small {{struggle}} sprang not a little, in its way, {{from the}} same impulse that had now carried him across to Notre Dame; the impulse to let things be, to give them time to justify themselves {{or at least to}} pass. He was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire not to be, for the hour, in certain other places; a sense of safety, of simplification, which each time he yielded to it he amused himself by thinking of as a private concession to cowardice. The great church had no altar for his worship, no direct voice for his soul; but it was none the less soothing even to sanctity; for he could feel while there what he couldn't elsewhere, that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday he had earned. He was tired, but he wasn't plain--that was the pity and the trouble of it; he was able, however, to drop his problem at the door very much {{as if it had been}} the copper piece that he deposited, on the threshold, in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar.

This form of sacrifice did at any rate for the occasion as well as another; it made him quite sufficiently understand how, within the precinct, for the real refugee, the things of the world could fall into abeyance. That was the cowardice, probably--to dodge them, to beg the question, not to deal with it in the hard outer light; but his own oblivions were too brief, too vain, to hurt any one but himself, and he had a vague and fanciful kindness for certain persons whom he met, figures of mystery and anxiety, and whom, with observation for his pastime, he ranked as those who were fleeing from justice. Justice was outside, in the hard light, and injustice too; but one was as absent as the other from the air of the long aisles and the brightness of the many altars.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{detecting}} target in system-dependent clutter (SDC) background with a single observation from the test cell is researched. Classical detectors, such as the generalized likelihood ratio detectors (GLRDs) and the adaptive matched filters (AMFs), etc., usually deal with <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> and <b>the</b> noise as a whole. The low rank detectors (LRDs) {{make use of the}} low rank property of <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> to improve <b>the</b> detection performance.

The SDC-ASD designs the test statistic by replacing the signal and <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> covariance matrix with their maximum likelihood estimations (MLEs). Its theoretical false alarm probability and detection probability are analytically deduced. Analytical results show that the test statistic has the form of non-central distribution. Besides, it is shown that the SDC-ASD has constant false alarm rate (CFAR) performance w. r. t. <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> and <b>the</b> noise.
