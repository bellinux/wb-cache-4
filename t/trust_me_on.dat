6000|$|He felt {{something}} knock against his shoulder, {{and he looked}} up to have his hat struck from his head by a horse's nose. He saw the horse put his foot on the hat, and he reflected, [...] "Now it will always look like an accordion," [...] and he heard the horse's driver address him some sarcasms before he could fully awaken to the situation. He was standing bareheaded in the middle of Fifth Avenue and blocking the tide of carriages flowing in either direction. Among the faces put out of the carriage windows he saw that of Dryfoos looking from a coupe. The old man knew him, and said, [...] "Jump in here, Mr. March"; and March, who had mechanically picked up his hat, and was thinking, [...] "Now I shall have to tell Isabel about this at once, and she will never <b>trust</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the street again without her," [...] mechanically obeyed. Her confidence in him had been undermined by his being so near Conrad when he was shot; and it went through his mind that he would get Dryfoos to drive him to a hatter's, where he could buy a new hat, and not be obliged to confess his narrow escape to his wife till the incident was some days old and she could bear it better. It quite drove Lindau's death out of his mind for the moment; and when Dryfoos said if he was going home he would drive up to the first cross-street and turn back with him, March said he would be glad if he would take him to a hat-store. The old man put his head out again and told the driver to take them to the Fifth Avenue Hotel. [...] "There's a hat-store around there somewhere, seems to me," [...] he said; and they talked of March's accident as well as they could in the rattle and clatter of the street till they reached the place. March got his hat, passing a joke with the hatter about the impossibility of pressing his old hat over again, and came out to thank Dryfoos and take leave of him.|$|E

500|$|After {{she rose}} to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her major-label debut Pies Descalzos (1995), Shakira was introduced to Emilio Estefan, the most important producer in the Hispanic market at the time, by her promoter and longtime friend, Jairo Martínez. Estefan was renowned for launching the careers of various Hispanic singers, such as Enrique Iglesias, Thalía, and his wife Gloria Estefan. He decided to work with Shakira as he identified her potential to strongly break into the US Latin market and expand her commercial presence there. One of Shakira's concerns was having creative autonomy over her music. Before signing their contract, the roles and duties were defined. Estefan would be her manager and her executive producer, but she would be in charge of all the material and arrangements and have approval over the final look of the records. She later stated about her producer, [...] "He had a great respect for me as an artist and <b>trusted</b> <b>me</b> totally <b>on</b> this project". Since then, they started working on Estefan's Crescent Moon Studios in Miami.|$|R

My grandmother was a singer and comedienne. My step-grandfather, a stand up comic and producer. My father, a comic, pianist, writer, composer, personality, producer, actor and finally critic - a good resting place for all his other skills. My mother, an actress and writer herself. I am doublebred for this life, from a family who melded myth, mayhem and magic into something that sometimes resembled a soap opera, more often a sitcom, with all the self-dramatization and chaos that entails. I come from three generations of non-marrying women which is in itself another story.So now I do for my daughter what three generations have trained me to. I use words to make sense of it all, to try and tease out the reality from the publicity releases, to fit the jigsaws together with my own glue - words. Words are dangerous. They turn on you, they go for the throat and draw blood, they twist under your hand into something strange and unknown to you, filled with meanings that you never anticipated. <b>Trust</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> this.
