5|$|On 27 January 1991, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met in Basra {{with the}} two Iraqi army corps commanders who would lead the operation, and Major General Salah Mahmoud told him that Khafji would be his by 30 January. During his return trip to Baghdad, Saddam Hussein's convoy was {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft; <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> escaped unscathed.|$|E
25|$|Later, Iraq and Kuwait met {{for a final}} {{negotiation}} session, which failed. Saddam {{then sent}} his troops into Kuwait. As tensions between Washington and Saddam began to escalate, the Soviet Union, under Mikhail Gorbachev, strengthened its military relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader,</b> providing him military advisers, arms and aid.|$|E
25|$|In February and March 2003, {{he visited}} Iraq {{and talked with}} Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as a special {{representative}} of President Putin. He brought to Baghdad a message from Putin to call for Saddam to resign voluntarily. He tried to prevent the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a move which received some support from several nations opposed to the war. Primakov suggested that Saddam must hand over all Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} to the United Nations, among other things. However, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> told Primakov he was confident that no harm would befall him personally—a belief that was later proven incorrect. Primakov later claimed Saddam's execution in 2006 was rushed to prevent him from revealing information on Iraq–United States relations that could embarrass the U.S. government.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>the</b> former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> Saddam Hussein, Doebbler argued before <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Special Tribunal that the court was illegal and did not respect human rights.|$|R
2500|$|Before the war, Aziz {{claimed he}} would rather die than be a U.S. {{prisoner}} of war: [...] "Do you expect me, after all my history as a militant and as one of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders,</b> {{to go to an}} American prison – to go to Guantanamo? I would rather die", he told Britain's ITV.|$|R
50|$|POW {{status for}} Saddam Hussein meant that <b>the</b> former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> would be {{eligible}} to stand trial for war crimes.|$|R
500|$|Saddam Hussein, who is {{believed}} to have said, [...] "The air force has never decided a war," [...] nevertheless worried that the air campaign would erode Iraq's national morale. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> also believed that the United States would not be willing to lose many troops in action, and therefore sought to draw Coalition ground troops into a decisive battle. In an attempt to provoke a ground battle, he directed Iraqi forces to launch Scud missiles against Israel, while continuing to threaten the destruction of oilfields in Kuwait. These efforts were unsuccessful in provoking a large ground battle, so Saddam Hussein decided to launch a limited offensive into Saudi Arabia with the aim of inflicting heavy losses on the Coalition armies.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. {{ambassador}} to Iraq April Glaspie met with Saddam {{in an emergency}} meeting on 25 July 1990, where <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> attacked American policy with regards to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates: ...|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{has also}} noted that, while President Bush [...] "never {{directly}} accused the former Iraqi leader {{of having a}} hand in the attacks on New York and Washington", he [...] "repeatedly associated the two in keynote addresses delivered since 11 September", adding that [...] "Senior members of his administration have similarly conflated the two." [...] For instance, the BBC report quotes Colin Powell in February 2003, stating that [...] "We've learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September 11, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America." [...] The same BBC report also noted the results of a recent opinion poll, which suggested that [...] "70% of Americans believe <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> was personally involved in the attacks." ...|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, Solarz {{stated that}} [...] "if the force used against Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the {{punishing}} U.N. economic sanctions {{that have been}} in place for seven years haven't persuaded Hussein to cooperate with U.N. inspectors, it's unlikely that a new and 'much more limited' military strike will change <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader's</b> mind." ...|$|R
50|$|Da'ud's father Ahmad al-Shaikh Da'ud {{was among}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> arrested during <b>the</b> 1920 <b>Iraqi</b> revolt and {{subsequently}} exiled. Her mother, Na'ima Sultan Hamuda, was also politically active: in 1919 she encouraged Gertrude Bell to provide education for girls, in 1920 she headed a Baghdad women's committee {{to support the}} revolt, and in 1923 {{she was one of}} the founding members of the Women's Awakening Club.|$|R
50|$|Saudi Arabia {{reportedly}} offered <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Kurdish <b>leaders</b> $2 {{billion in}} exchange for delaying the process for ten years.|$|R
2500|$|On December 25, 2006, the United States {{arrested at}} least four senior {{military}} officials on their visit to Baghdad. It has been mentioned that the Iranians have been arrested after US soldiers raided the compound of Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the influential Shiite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). President of Iraq Talabani, a strong US ally, has asked for their release. Hiwa Othman, Talabani's media adviser, told Reuters: [...] "The president is unhappy. He is talking to the Americans about it as we speak." [...] Othman said the Iranian diplomats came to Iraq {{at the invitation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> but he was not aware if they had met with him."The invitation was within the framework of an agreement between Iran and Iraq to improve the security situation." [...] Finally, it seems that they have been released on 30 December. One of the commanders, identified by officials simply as Chizari, was the third-highest-ranking official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' al-Quds Brigade, the unit most active in aiding, arming and training groups outside Iran, including Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, U.S. officials said.|$|E

50|$|Just {{prior to}} Desert Fox, the U.S. nearly led a bombing {{campaign}} against Saddam called Operation Desert Thunder. It was abandoned {{at the last}} minute when <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> allowed the UN to continue weapons inspections.|$|E
5000|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross {{says the}} US-led {{coalition}} in Iraq {{had given the}} agency the [...] "green light" [...] to visit Saddam Hussein, <b>the</b> former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|R
50|$|Red Cross {{spokesman}} Florian Westphal {{confirmed that}} ICRC visits to <b>the</b> captured <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> would go ahead according to international rules governing the detention of all prisoners of war. He said discussions {{are under way}} as to how and where those visits would take place.|$|R
50|$|On 13 June 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush paid a {{visit to}} Baghdad to meet with al-Maliki and President of Iraq Jalal Talabani, as a token of support for the new government. During this visit, they {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Leaders</b> Initiative, in which students from Iraq would go to the United States to build a personal connection between the two countries. On 25 June, al-Maliki presented a national reconciliation plan to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> parliament. <b>The</b> peace plan sets out to remove powerful militias from the streets, open a dialogue with rebels, and review the status of purged members of the once dominant Ba'ath party. Some viewed this as a bold step towards rebuilding Iraq and reaching out to Sunnis.|$|R
50|$|Clinton {{authorized}} {{the use of}} punitive military force against Saddam's regime {{as part of this}} strategy, such as in 1993, when it was discovered that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> had plotted to assassinate George H. W. Bush, and in 1998 when Saddam expelled United Nations weapons inspectors.|$|E
50|$|Later, Iraq and Kuwait met {{for a final}} {{negotiation}} session, which failed. Saddam {{then sent}} his troops into Kuwait.

5000|$|In January 1994, Galloway faced some of {{his strongest}} {{criticism}} on his return from a Middle-Eastern visit during which he had met Saddam Hussein. At his meeting with <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader,</b> he reported the support given to Saddam {{by the people of}} the Gaza Strip which he had just visited: [...] "I can honestly tell you that {{there was not a single}} person to whom I told I was coming to Iraq and hoping to meet with yourself who did not wish me to convey their heartfelt, fraternal greetings and support." [...] He ended his speech with the statement [...] "Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability." [...] Galloway has asserted that he was saluting the Iraqi people rather than Saddam Hussein in the speech, which was translated for <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{government}} and <b>leaders</b> behind the campaign were not punished for their campaign of genocide or the violations against the Geneva Protocol of 1928.|$|R
50|$|The spokesman, Major Michael Shavers, said Saddam, {{captured}} by US troops in December, {{was entitled to}} all the rights under the Geneva Conventions. The International Committee of the Red Cross had asked to visit <b>the</b> former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> as soon as possible. The US spokesman did not give further details about Saddam Hussein's conditions of detention.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{reports have}} {{questioned}} the official Saddam Hussein government version of how much blood was donated {{in the making of}} the Quran (or if it was even Saddams blood in the first place). Reporter Philip Smucker reported in Baghdad on July 29, 2001; [...] "Most striking is the dubious and totally unverifiable claim that Saddam donated nearly 50 pints of his own blood for the writing of a Quran." [...] Smucker also wrote: [...] "Western diplomats based in Baghdad are unimpressed with <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> religious devotion, dismissing the mosque and its holy book written in blood as a crude publicity stunt. How can we be sure this is Saddams blood and not that of some of his victims? one asked." ...|$|R
50|$|Seven years later, Operation Bramble Bush II {{once again}} {{targeted}} Saddam. Mossad agents had scouted locations in Iraq for the ambush of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader.</b> However, as before, {{the plan was}} scrapped, this time due to both the U.S. and Britain's Operation Desert Fox and concerns that the assassination could harm the Israeli-Arab peace process.|$|E

5000|$|On September 25, the Washington Post {{reported}} that [...] "Kuwait City's hospitals are being stripped of incubators."The president of Citizens for a Free Kuwait wrote to Representative Gus Yatron stating {{of how he}} [...] "recently learned that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> has ordered that maternity hospital incubators Kuwait, used for treating premature babies, be turned off, allowing these infants to die of exposure." ...|$|E
5000|$|Zarqawi's second wife, Isra, was 14 {{years old}} when he married her. She was the {{daughter}} of Yassin Jarrad, a Palestinian Islamic militant, who is blamed for the killing in 2003 of Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Shia <b>leader.</b> She bore him a child when she was 15 and was killed along with Zarqawi and their child.|$|R
5000|$|The {{guards at}} the Baghdad {{detention}} facility called their prisoner [...] "Vic," [...] and let him plant a small garden near his cell. The nickname and the garden are among the details about <b>the</b> former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> that emerged during a 27 March 2008 tour of prison of the Baghdad cell where Saddam slept, bathed, and kept a journal {{in the final days}} before his execution.|$|R
50|$|Al-Hakim {{returned}} to Iraq on 12 May 2003 following {{the overthrow of}} Saddam's regime by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. There he {{emerged as one of}} <b>the</b> most influential <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders,</b> with his longtime opposition to Saddam gaining him immense credibility, especially among the majority Shia population.|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 1996, the Iraqi {{military}} {{launched its}} biggest offensive since 1991 {{against the city}} of Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan. This attack stoked American fears that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> Saddam Hussein intended to launch a genocidal campaign against the Kurds similar to the campaigns of 1988 and 1991. It also placed Saddam in clear violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 forbidding repression of Iraqs ethnic minorities.|$|E
5000|$|Anti-Saddam Iraqi groups begin {{defacing}} and vandalising {{posters of}} the dictator all over Iraq. Demonstrations also {{take place in}} Kirkuk, where an estimated crowd of 20,000 marched on the Ba'ath party's main administrative headquarters demanding the overthrow of Saddam's government. Three posters of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> were torn to pieces and a grenade was thrown at the government building. Some reports indicate that one senior Ba'ath party official {{was killed in the}} attack.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was removed}} from the {{position}} in 1986 in favour of Saddam Hussein's son, Qusay Hussein. Due to his close resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader,</b> he played the part of Saddam Hussein in the film The Long Days, a propagandistic account of Saddam Hussein's life. In 1995, he defected from Iraq with his brother and their wives. His brother gave information to UNSCOM, the CIA and MI6 about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.|$|E
50|$|France {{supported}} Iraq as {{the second}} greatest military supplier, and tended to supply higher-technology equipment than <b>the</b> Soviets. <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> were inclined to blame their Soviet-supplied equipment for failings rather than admit their own organizational and training problems. While Soviet equipment may have been inferior to others, it was effective when handled properly, but <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> supplemented or replaced it with French equipment. The competition between France and the Soviet Union as an arms supplier was a continuing issue for Iraq. Iraq approached the French in late 1980 with requests to buy Crotale and Roland surface-to-air missile systems (SAMs) to augment their depleted Soviet SAM arsenal.|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to Iraq in 1979, when Saddam Hussein came to power, and largely {{stayed out of}} the public and political spotlight afterwards. He was allowed to leave the country once to undertake the Hajj. Arif left Iraq permanently after Hussein was removed from power by the U.S.-led invasion, and lived in Amman, Jordan from 2004. He died in Amman on August 24, 2007, being yet one of <b>the</b> few <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> in modern times to die a natural death. He was married to Faika Abdul-Mageed Faris Alanee.|$|R
5000|$|During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> armor {{was usually}} tanks of Russian design, which {{included}} the T-54/55, T-62, Type 59, Type 69, and T-72. In the Battle of Khafji, the first major ground engagement of <b>the</b> Gulf War, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> Saddam Hussein, {{tried and failed to}} draw Coalition troops into a costly ground engagements with his armoured forces and sent the 1st and 5th Mechanized Divisions and 3rd Armored Division to conduct a multi-pronged invasion toward Khafji, engaging American, Saudi and Qatari forces along the coastline.|$|R
