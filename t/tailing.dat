40|$|<b>Tail</b> biting in pigs is a {{widespread}} behavioural vice with significant animal welfare and economic consequences. All too often, <b>tail</b> biting is not diagnosed nor dealt with until <b>tail</b> damage is present. To effectively reduce {{the negative effects of}} <b>tail</b> biting, it must be diagnosed in an early stage. So far no predictors for <b>tail</b> damage have been found. Predictors that recognise <b>tail</b> biting in an early stage, however, would be helpful in practice. We tested the hypothesis that <b>tail</b> behaviour can predict <b>tail</b> damage. To analyse this, we observed <b>tail</b> posture, <b>tail</b> motion and <b>tail</b> damage of 992 weaned piglets on an experimental farm with known <b>tail</b> biting problems. <b>Tail</b> posture (curled <b>tail,</b> hanging <b>tail</b> or <b>tail</b> between legs), <b>tail</b> motion (motionless, wagging or intense wagging) and <b>tail</b> damage (no damage, bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound) were observed three times a week during the 32 days post-weaning period. Results showed that both <b>tail</b> posture and <b>tail</b> motion were related to <b>tail</b> damage at the same observation moment (P 0. 05). When a piglet was observed with a curled <b>tail</b> (and no <b>tail</b> damage), the chance of bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound 2 – 3 days later were 8. 6 % and 3. 5 %. When a piglet was observed with its <b>tail</b> between the legs (and no <b>tail</b> damage), the chance of bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound 2 – 3 days later increased to 22. 3 % and 8. 5 %. Furthermore, when a piglet was observed with its <b>tail</b> between the legs (and no <b>tail</b> damage) in two consecutive observations, the chance of bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound 2 – 3 days later increased to 32. 4 % and 23. 7 %. It was concluded that a piglet's <b>tail</b> posture is strongly related to <b>tail</b> damage at the same moment and can predict <b>tail</b> damage 2 – 3 days later. Checking <b>tail</b> postures on a regular basis increases early recognition of <b>tail</b> biting. This can help pig producers to take appropriate measures to prevent further escalation of the problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Tail</b> biting is {{a common}} and serious welfare problem in pig production, causing large {{economical}} losses. <b>Tail</b> docking is performed routinely in most EU countries to reduce the <b>tail</b> biting risk. However, <b>tail</b> docking is painful, and does not prevent <b>tail</b> biting totally. The risk factors behind <b>tail</b> docking are multifactorial and most analyses are based on studies using biological or epidemiological approaches. There is very little information available on how producers deal with <b>tail</b> biting on-farm. There are also no studies on the attitude of producers towards <b>tail</b> docking and <b>tail</b> biting in systems with long-tailed pigs. We aimed to study how farmers rate the efficiency of different measures for preventing and intervening with <b>tail</b> biting, when <b>tail</b> docking is not allowed. Furthermore, we investigated the attitudes of Finnish farmers to <b>tail</b> docking and <b>tail</b> biting. Results Respondents scored feeding-related issues to be most important for prevention of <b>tail</b> biting, identifying and removing the biting pig as most important intervention measures, and straw {{as the most important}} manipulable material when preventing <b>tail</b> biting. <b>Tail</b> biting was not perceived as a very serious problem by over 70  % of the respondents, even though docking is not allowed, and was reported to occur close to a level which was also considered acceptable by the respondents. Most respondents did not think it is probable they would raise <b>tail</b> docked pigs if it were possible, but about 21  % probably would. Conclusions In comparison with other authors’ findings, the ranking of importance of risk factors for <b>tail</b> biting differs between scientists and farmers, and between farmers in different cultures of pig production. In addition, the attitude towards <b>tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> docking appears to be very different in producers with different experiences of <b>tail</b> docking.

40|$|<b>Tail</b> biting is {{an adverse}} {{behaviour}} characterised by manipulation of a pig’s <b>tail</b> by another pig resulting in <b>tail</b> damage {{and a possible}} <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. <b>Tail</b> biting is a common problem in the pig husbandry causing economic losses and reduced animal welfare worldwide. To prevent <b>tail</b> biting, the majority of newborn piglets are <b>tail</b> docked, a procedure which is not only painful but generates more and more public concern. This emphasizes the need to prevent the occurrences of <b>tail</b> biting without having to dock a pig’s <b>tail.</b> So far, research focused mainly on the risk factors that can induce <b>tail</b> biting. However, the way a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak evolves {{in a group of}} pigs (the ‘aetiology’) is still poorly understood. For that reason, the main aim of this thesis was to gain more insight in the aetiology of a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. This will not only enhance our understanding of the current preventive and curative treatments of <b>tail</b> biting, but can also generate more effective measures to prevent, predict and counteract a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. Therefore, the development of <b>tail</b> biting behaviour and <b>tail</b> damage was studied in relation to preventive and curative measures, group composition and indicators for an upcoming <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. The results showed that the provision of twice daily a handful of long straw strongly reduced <b>tail</b> biting. Furthermore, this measure was also effective in counteracting an ongoing <b>tail</b> biting outbreak (an outbreak was defined as the first day with a minimum of one piglet with a <b>tail</b> wound or two piglets with bite marks in a pen), although this outbreak could not be totally eliminated. In pens without straw almost all pigs performed and received <b>tail</b> biting behaviour at low levels prior to a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. However, considerable variation in <b>tail</b> biting behaviour between pigs was found. In most pens one or a few pigs could be identified as pronounced biters prior to the <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. Although less clear, often one or a few pigs could similarly be identified as pronounced victims. In mixed-sex pens male pigs developed <b>tail</b> damage most rapidly, while in single-sex pens the quickest <b>tail</b> damage development was found in all-female groups. These results indicate that female pigs are more likely to become biters and male pigs are more likely to become victims. More detailed study of pronounced biters and victims showed that prior to a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak, biters not only directed more of their biting behaviour to their penmates’ <b>tail,</b> but also to the enrichment device. Victims were the heavier pigs in the pen and tended to be more often male and more restless preceding an outbreak. Victims also performed more aggressive behaviour, while biters tended to receive more aggressive behaviour. Furthermore, it was found that <b>tail</b> posture is a predictor for <b>tail</b> damage. Pigs with their <b>tail</b> between the legs had a higher chance of <b>tail</b> damage 2 - 3 days later. Based on the results of this research an aetiology model of a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak was developed. Subsequently practical suggestions were given to prevent (e. g. providing effective environmental enrichment), predict (e. g. observing the pigs’ <b>tail</b> posture) and counteract (e. g. removing the biter) a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. This provides opportunities to omit <b>tail</b> docking without the negative consequence of <b>tail</b> biting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{increasing}} interest in recording <b>tail</b> damage in pigs at slaughter to identify problem farms for advisory purposes, {{but also for}} benchmarking within and between countries as part of systematic monitoring of animal welfare. However, {{it is difficult to}} draw conclusions when comparing prevalence’s between studies and countries partly due to differences in management (e. g. differences in <b>tail</b> docking and enrichment routines) and partly due to differences in the definition of <b>tail</b> damage. Methods <b>Tail</b> damage and <b>tail</b> length was recorded for 15, 068 pigs slaughtered during three and four consecutive days at two slaughterhouses in Sweden. <b>Tail</b> damage was visually scored according to a 6 -point scale and <b>tail</b> length was both visually scored according to a 5 -point scale and recorded as <b>tail</b> length in centimetres for pigs with injured or shortened <b>tails.</b> Results The total prevalence of injury or shortening of the <b>tail</b> was 7. 0 % and 7. 2 % in slaughterhouse A and B, respectively. When only considering pigs with half or less of the <b>tail</b> left, these percentages were 1. 5 % and 1. 9 %, which is in line with the prevalence estimated from the routine recordings at slaughter in Sweden. A higher percentage of males had injured and/or shortened <b>tails,</b> and males had more severely bitten <b>tails</b> than females. Conclusions While the current method to record <b>tail</b> damage in Sweden was found to be reliable as a method to identify problem farms, it clearly underestimates the actual prevalence of <b>tail</b> damage. For monitoring and benchmarking purposes, both in Sweden and internationally, we propose that a three graded scale including both old and new <b>tail</b> damage would be more appropriate. The scale consists of one class for no <b>tail</b> damage, one for mild <b>tail</b> damage (injured or shortened <b>tail</b> with {{more than half of the}} <b>tail</b> remaining) and one for severe <b>tail</b> damage (half or less of the <b>tail</b> remaining). </p...|$|R
