30|$|However, AR is also {{prone to}} {{presenting}} {{too much information}} and too much context from the environment leading to cluttered displays (Peterson et al. 2009; Grasset et al. 2012). This problem arises {{from the fact that}} the environment cannot be controlled by the author of the content, whereas all other types of multimedia (books, computer-based media, virtual environments, etc.) give authors full control of the content. For example, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> illustration as abstract or as contextualized as they like by removing or adding some details. In the case of AR, the environment is a given and authors of AR learning contents must make use of the environment creatively.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical {{reasoning}}; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see fuzzy logic). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, {{it is necessary to}} specify and formalize what those gradations are, if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other substructural logics. The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially infinite number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that Judgment is an {{inevitable}} aspect {{of living for}} both individuals and organizations. Judgments involve information acquisition and processing that are required in helping individuals <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision.

Unfortunately individuals, as human beings, have cognitive limitations in searching for and processing information. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> inaccurate judgment. As Hogarth (1980) argues, although individuals are adaptive, they have limited information processing capacities. This paper discusses cognitive limitations of individuals in obtaining and processing information, {{the potential impact of}} the limitations on making decisions, and possibilities to over come the limitations. ...|$|R
