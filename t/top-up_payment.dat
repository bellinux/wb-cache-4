40|$|In {{the year}} 2008, Chile {{brought in a}} {{comprehensive}} reform of its pension system, the main change being {{the introduction of a}} New Solidarity Pillar designed to eliminate the incidence of poverty among elderly adults. This new program sets a floor of around 50 % of a minimum monthly income for the poorest 60 % of the population by means of noncontributory benefits for people without pension rights and a solidarity <b>top-up</b> <b>payment</b> for people who have not accumulated enough in the way of pension rights. Although special attention was given {{in the design of the}} new scheme to minimize the adverse effects on incentives to take part in the contributory scheme, the theory suggests that both the level of benefits and the gradual reduction of these, conditional upon the selffunded pension, could affect contributory participation. On the one hand, greater future wealth is likely to reduce the incentive to save in the present (income effect); this effect is magnified by the fact that the future subsidy is partially reduced if the person saved more in the present (substitution effect). Internationally, however, there is little empirical evidence about the real impact of these effects on people’s behavior with regard to pensions. The Chilean reform could constitute an opportunity to measure these effects in a real case. This paper describes the main characteristics of the solidarity pillar, the background that gave rise to its creation, presents some preliminary results of the program in terms of beneficiaries and amounts, and discusses the theoretical effects on incentives to pay into the contributory system, relative to the poverty-prevention schemes that were present prior to the reform...|$|E

30|$|Wage {{subsidies}} aim at complementing low incomes with an income-contingent {{wage subsidy}} {{to improve the}} financial incentives to accept a low-paid job. There are currently several forms of wage subsidies in Germany, e.g. <b>top-up</b> <b>payments</b> for recipients of unemployment compensation or the partial or full exemption of social contributions {{up to a certain}} threshold. We analyze a specific wage subsidy, the so-called ‘employment bonus’, which does not subsidize low wage incomes but low hourly wages and is related to individual but not household income. This avoids negative labor supply incentives for secondary earners.|$|R

40|$|The English National Health Service is {{promoting}} {{concentration of the}} treatment of patients with relatively rare and complex conditions into {{a limited number of}} specialist centres. If these patients are more costly to treat, the prospective payment system based on Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) may need refinement because these centres will be financially disadvantaged. To assess the funding implications of this concentration policy, we estimate the cost differentials associated with caring for patients that receive complex care and examine the extent to which complex care services are concentrated across hospitals and HRGs. We estimate random effects models using patient-level activity and cost data for all patients admitted to English hospitals during the 2013 / 14 financial year and construct measures of the concentration of complex services. Payments for complex care services need to be adjusted if they have large cost differentials and if provision is concentrated within a few hospitals. Payments can be adjusted either by refining HRGs or making <b>top-up</b> <b>payments</b> to HRG prices. HRG refinement is preferred to top-payments the greater the concentration of services among HRGs...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union. Special emphasis is given to effects that have resulted from implementing the Common Agricultural Policy. Two approaches are applied. First, in an ex post analysis we address how accession has thus far influenced structural changes and the income situation. Second, in an ex ante analysis we apply the agent-based model AgriPoliS to simulate the impact of decoupling <b>top-up</b> <b>payments</b> on structural change, farm income and payment redistribution. In the ex post analysis, it is observed that structural change is still influenced by the transformation process. Farm income partially follows the increase of payments, {{but there is also a}} capitalisation of payments into factor prices for land, labour and other inputs. Furthermore, simulations support empirical findings that accession slows down structural change compared to a scenario without accession, while decoupling top-ups in 2009 has no significant impact on structural change. However, depending on the type of decoupling, a redistribution of payments among farmers can be observed. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a cost - minimisation algorithm to explore the potential impact of two options for financial support for low carbon generation in the form of contracts for difference in a system with locational marginal pricing: 1. with a system-wide strike price; 2. with locational strike prices. A two zone system is modelled with the additional financial support for low carbon generation represented as negative variable costs that have the effect of filling in the difference between wholesale market prices and the strike price, the latter intended to cover the long-run costs of low carbon generation. The British case is modelled {{in which there is a}} limit to the total top-up expenditure. It is shown that the case of a system-wide strike price can result in less new low carbon generation capacity compared with the case of locational strike prices, due to the increased top-up spend in the lower price zone more rapidly meeting the constraint on the total cost of <b>top-up</b> <b>payments</b> to low carbon generation. However, it is also shown that the imposition of this constraint leads to a failure of the model to settle on one solution due to the non-convex relationship between installed capacity of low carbon generation and wholesale market price...|$|R

40|$|The article {{contains}} a proposal of the methodology {{for the creation of}} resources, monetary funds into agriculture by way of tax savings. Those are created by way of the utilization of items deductible from the tax base. The average official price of agricultural land for the cadastral area and a proposed “land rate” (3. 3 %) were used for the calculation of deductible items. The land rate was calculated as the inverse value of the return time for investments in agricultural land. The calculated tax savings according to the relevant tax rate and the amount of the deductible item constitutes the amount of CZK 306 - 388 /ha of agricultural land {{depending on the type of}} business entity. The arisen savings correspond, for example, to the compensation for the cancelled <b>TOP-UP</b> (2010) <b>payments</b> for agricultural land. Other reserves within the current economic system (untaxed agricultural subsidies) could also lead, for example, to the protection of the agricultural land fund in terms of quantity and quality. The said results can be important not only from an information standpoint, but primarily from a methodological standpoint.

40|$|Abstract Background Since the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, development assistance for HIV/AIDS has increasingly been provided through Global Health Initiatives, specifically the United States Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund to Fight HIV, TB and Malaria and the World Bank Multi-country AIDS Programme. Zambia, like many of the countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS in southern Africa, also faces a shortage of human resources for health. The country receives significant amounts of funding from GHIs for the large-scale provision of antiretroviral treatment through the public and private sector. This paper examines the impact of GHIs on human resources for ART roll-out in Zambia, at national level, in one province and two districts. Methods It is a qualitative policy analysis relying on in-depth interviews with more than 90 policy-makers and implementers at all levels. Results Findings show that while GHIs do not provide significant funding for additional human resources, their interventions have significant impact on human resources for health at all levels. While GHIs successfully retrain a large number of health workers, evidence suggests that GHIs actively deplete the pool of skilled human resources for health by recruiting public sector staff to work for GHI-funded nongovernmental implementing agencies. The secondment of GHI staff into public sector facilities may help alleviate immediate staff shortages, but this practice risks undermining sustainability of programmes. GHI-supported programmes and initiatives add significantly to the workload of existing public sector staff at all levels, while incentives including salary <b>top-ups</b> and overtime <b>payments</b> mean that ART programmes are more popular among staff than services for non-focal diseases. Conclusion Research findings suggest that GHIs need to actively mediate against the potentially negative consequences of their funding on human resources for health. Evidence presented highlights the need for new strategies that integrate retraining of existing staff with longer-term staff development to ensure staff retention. The study results show that GHIs must provide significant new and longer-term funding for additional human resources to avoid negative consequences on the overall provision of health care services and to ensure sustainability and quality of programmes they support. </p...|$|R
