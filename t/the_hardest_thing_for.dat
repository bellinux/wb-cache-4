We are all {{influenced}} by past figures we admire, but in the case Daymere's protagonist, Allan Mellish, he has almost become his idol. Struggling with his desire to be a screenwriter and his awkwardness in high school, Allan tends to just lock himself away in his room and is constantly watching Woody Allen films or writing in his notepad. In his creative writing class, his work is finally challenged when a brilliant young girl named Mia makes Allan realize that every piece he writes is essentially an exact replica of a Woody Allen script. Allan is forced to look at himself and discover how to blend his love of Woody's style with his own. In doing so, Allan will finally be able to release his inner voice.

40|$|Rapid vocal motor {{learning}} is observed when acquiring a language in early childhood, or learning to speak another language later in life. Accurate pronunciation {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> late learners to master and they are almost always left with a non-native accent. Here I propose a novel hypothesis that this accent could be improved by optimizing variability in vocal learning brain circuits during learning. Much of the neurobiology of human vocal motor learning has been inferred from studies on songbirds. Jarvis (2004) proposed the hypothesis that as in songbirds there are two pathways in humans: one for learning speech (the striatal vocal learning pathway), and one for production of previously learnt speech (the motor pathway). Learning new motor sequences necessary for accurate non-native pronunciation is challenging and I argue that in late learners of a foreign language the vocal learning pathway becomes inactive prematurely. The motor pathway is engaged once again and learners maintain their original native motor patterns for producing speech, resulting in speaking with a foreign accent. Further, I argue that variability in neural activity within vocal motor circuitry generates vocal variability that supports accurate non-native pronunciation. Recent theoretical and experimental work on motor learning suggests that variability in the motor movement {{is necessary for the}} development of expertise. I propose that there is little trial-by-trial variability when using the motor pathway. When using the vocal learning pathway variability gradually increases, reflecting an exploratory phase in which learners try out different ways of pronouncing words, before decreasing and stabilizing once the ‘best’ performance has been identified. The hypothesis proposed here could be tested using behavioral interventions that optimize variability and engage the vocal learning pathway for longer, with the prediction that this would allow learners to develop new motor patterns that result in more native-like pronunciation...|$|R

5000|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the rarity of the knuckleball is the difficulty of throwing the pitch. R.A. Dickey estimates that it takes {{at least a year}} to grasp the fundamentals of the knuckleball. The knuckleball is radically different than any other pitch in a pitcher's arsenal, and less predictable, thus difficult to control. It {{is for this reason that}} the knuckleball is widely regarded as unreliable, and knuckleball pitchers are prone to extended slumps, such as when Tim Wakefield was released from the Pirates in a mid-career slump during spring training in 1995. Another reason for the difficulty of the knuckleball is due to the network effect. Because there are so few knuckleball pitchers, the resources for learning and improving the knuckleball are few compared to more common pitches. Pitching coaches often struggle with knuckleball pitchers due to a lack of experience with the pitch.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{usability}} of the Umeå University library catalogue Album. The aim is to evaluate the catalogue in order to establish if there are any problems that could be solved by modifying the catalogue. The following questions are answered: How should a good catalogue be designed? Which problems are common when using a library catalogue? Is Album user friendly? Are there any problems that occur when using Album and how can the catalogue be changed to avoid the problems? To answer these questions I have performed a usability test in which five persons, all students, got to carry out twenty tasks in the catalogue and talk about what they were doing and thinking while doing the test. This method is a usability method called Think Aloud. After the test the users got to answer twenty interview questions about the catalogue. The material obtained from the test was analyzed and positive factors, problems and courses of action were picked out. The results of the study show that <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the users is to perform subject searches. It is not clear what subject and classification is and the users don’t know how to search the Index. They also think it’s hard to know in which fields to search and which words to use.

Although there are some problems with the catalogue, the overall impression of Album seems to be positive among the users...|$|E
40|$|Mater Thesis. Mentor: Dr. Sc. Qatip ArifiHelping {{students}} to relieve from the emotional factor, {{is not an}} easy job, especially for a teacher. As every student is different in behaviors, dealing with different attitudes and trying to understand every student in the way they learn best, can sometimes be <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> a teacher. According to the literature, when students enter secondary school they go through some changes that affect their overall behavior. If students do not find that warm environment that triggers them into learning, they must find school boring and probably they will quit on their efforts to learn. During the transition of students into high school, the emotional factor is another problem that most of the students encounter. Due to the emotional factor, students must find really hard to accommodate in the classroom. Thus it is very demanding that teachers help their students. This can be done through some methods that every EL teacher must provide in the classroom. This thesis will focus in the techniques and methods that a contemporary EL teacher must apply in the classroom in order get the students attention. The motivation that student must get, it is an important aspect that helps {{students to}} appreciate the real value of learning. This thesis will focus on the methods and the techniques that an English language teacher must provide in a classroom in order to engage their students in the process of learning. The construction of the thesis will be based on experiments and questionnaires. Due to these experiments it will be evaluated what are some specific aspects of contemporary teaching that help students to overcome the emotional factor that affects their ability to properly relate to topics demonstrated in the classroom...|$|E
