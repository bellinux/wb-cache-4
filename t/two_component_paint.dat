This type of paint can be useful for coating metal in port, ship structure, oil vessels and in agricultural and food safety applications. Also, usage of this paint for disinfection of veterinary environment such as aviculture space and walls and other places, inhibit the growth of pathogenic micro-organism, {{it can be used}} in generally for all positions and locations which are in clouding corrosion rough weather conditions. In this case additive materials and prime matters, the paint conditions shifted toward to a perfectly meet the above needs. The riched cine is such a <b>two</b> <b>component</b> <b>paint</b> based on resin epoxy polyamide. The second compound is the strengthener which the last part brought it as the catalyst and dryness of the film of the paint which has been responsible for hard duties. After physicochemical tests was found that due to the existence of proper percentage of zinc oxide and zinc phosphate pigments, the paint No. 10 had the best quality between other prepared paints...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} organic systems, containing either {{vinyl acetate}} resins or epoxy resins were applied on steel pretreated specimens exposed to deionized and deaerated water {{taken from the}} installations of the Public Greek Electricity Company. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization measurements, dielectric measurements and visual observations after salt spray test were performed for monitoring the changes of the organic systems characteristics at predetermined exposure time in the deionized - deaerated water. All four coating systems found providing protection on steel surfaces. The classification of their performance depends mainly on {{the composition of the}} primer, as well as, on the intrinsic characteristics of the other layers. Thus the system consisting of epoxy primer with zinc dust, epoxy high build layer and a <b>two</b> <b>component</b> epoxy <b>paint</b> with iron oxide is the one exhibiting the highest protection efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the levels of formaldehyde and organic acids that can build up within enclosed spaces. Another goal was to compare two types of paints {{that can be used}} as coating barriers within showcases and in turn compare them to the modern, and by many highly recommended, material of Marveseal®. A low volatile waterborne alkyd/acrylate <b>paint</b> and a <b>two</b> <b>component</b> polyurethane <b>paint</b> was compared to Marveseal® in two series of experiments. One series measured the level of formaldehyde, and thus the effectiveness of the three chosen barriers, and the other series measured the level of volatile organic acids, both the acids emitted from the paint itself, and that of the wood. One box in each series were not treated at all and was used as a reference. The fact that different types of materials emit volatile organic compounds have long been known. The prime concern for museums has been the emission of formaldehyde and organic acids, such as acetic acid and formic acd. Inorganic pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and ozone, are also of concern. The various effects these have on artefacts have been studied, especially the corrosive effects on metals and calcareous materials. However, the effects on paintings and their different components, such as pigments and varnishes, have not been quite so thoroughly investigated, even though some studies have been carried out. Completely airtight showcases, or showcases with very litte air exchange rate, are common at museums. They serve as protective ”boxes” for the exhibited artefacts inside against external airpollution, theft or vandalism. They can however also serve as a trap for internally emitted organic pollutants such as formaldehyde. In museums today staff and conservators work under tight timeframes, and the materials that are to be used in an exhibitions may not be given the time they need to be stable enough and safe to use. The results in this study showed that materials that have been recommended as so called safe materials, may not be as protective as they are known for, if they are not given the correct time for drying or if they are applied wrongly...|$|R

When the <b>two</b> <b>components</b> were partially de-natured under critical conditions, they were found to bind equally to the hydroxyapatite crystals; but they behaved very differently after being sub-jected to extensive denaturation, indicating the dependence of the chromato-graphic properties of the <b>two</b> <b>components</b> on their configuration.
