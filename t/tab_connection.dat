40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} next generation electric and hybrid vehicle technology is the control and management of heat generation and operating temperatures. Vehicle performance, reliability and ultimately consumer market adoption are integrally dependent on successful battery thermal management designs. It will be shown that in the absence of active cooling, surface temperatures of operating lithium-ion batteries can reach as high as 50 °C, within 5 °C of the maximum safe operating temperature. Even in the presence of active cooling, surface temperatures greater than 45 °C are attainable. It is thus of paramount importance to electric vehicle and battery thermal management designers to quantify the effect of temperature and discharge rate on heat generation, energy output, and temperature response of operating lithium-ion batteries. This work presents a purely experimental thermal characterization of thermo-physical properties and operating behavior of a lithium-ion battery utilizing a promising electrode material, LiFePO 4, in a prismatic pouch configuration. Crucial to thermal modeling is accurate thermo-physical property input. Thermal resistance measurements were made using specially constructed battery samples. The thru-plane thermal conductivity of LiFePO 4 positive electrode and negative electrode materials was found to be 1. 79 ± 0. 18 W/m°C and 1. 17 ± 0. 12 W/m°C respectively. The emissivity of the outer pouch was evaluated to enable accurate IR temperature detection and found to be 0. 86. Charge-discharge testing was performed to enable thermal management design solutions. Heat generated by the battery along with surface temperature and heat flux at distributed locations was measured using a purpose built apparatus containing cold plates supplied by a controlled cooling system. Heat flux measurements were consistently recorded at values approximately 400 % higher at locations near the external tabs compared to measurements taken a relatively short distance down the battery surface. The highest heat flux recorded was 3112 W/m 2 near the negative electrode during a 4 C discharge at 5 °C operating temperature. Total heat generated during a 4 C discharge nearly doubled when operating temperature was decreased from 35 °C to 5 °C, illustrating a strong dependence of heat generation mechanisms on temperature. Peak heat generation rates followed the same trend and the maximum rate of 90. 7 W occurred near the end of 5 °C, 4 C discharge rate operation. As a result, the maximum value of total heat generated was 41. 34 kJ during the same discharge conditions. The effect of increasing discharge rate from 1 C to 4 C caused heat generation to double for all operating temperatures due to the increased ohmic heating. Heat generation was highest where the thermal gradient was largest. The largest gradient, near negative electrode current collector to external <b>tab</b> <b>connection</b> and was evaluated using IR thermography to be 0. 632 °C/mm during 4 C discharge with passive room temperature natural convection air cooling. Battery designs should utilize a greater connection thickness to minimize both electrical resistance and current density which both drive the dominant mode of heat generation, ohmic heating. Otherwise cooling solutions should be concentrated on this region to minimize the temperature gradient on the battery...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural EngineeringKimberly W. KramerIn {{structural}} steel connection design, simple shear connections {{are one of}} the most common connection types utilized. The industry, especially from the side of the engineer, tends to lean toward using Double Clip Angle Connections as the default standard for simple shear connections. A double clip angle connection is a connection consisting of two angles transferring the shear forces from one member to the next either through bolts or welds. The design of Double Clip Angle Connections is efficient and the connections themselves are easy to fabricate. However, benefits to utilizing other types of shear connections exist. Many of these benefits are seen in the fabrication shop or during erection and construction. This is especially true of single shear plate or shear <b>tab</b> <b>connections</b> when applied to open structure design. Shear <b>tab</b> <b>connections</b> consist of a single plate that transfers the shear forces from one member to the next with bolts or with welds. The design of shear <b>tab</b> <b>connections</b> can be a more involved process than the design of double clip angles. Sometimes the shear plate or shear tab has to be longer than is typical. This is called an extended shear plate connection. These extended shear plates can bring other variables into the design that typically don’t occur with Double Clip Angle Connections such as bending of the plate or the need for multiple bolt columns. However, with proper planning and detailing, the benefits and savings experienced in the fabrication or construction phase may outweigh what can be seen as a more laborious design task. The purpose of this report is to identify the possible benefits achieved in using each of these connections, highlight the differences in the design approach for each, and use a study model to compare the outcome of using one connection over another in the design of a typical open structure. Double clip angles are typically the most efficient approach when speed of design and simplicity of fabrication are the desired outcomes. However, shear plate or shear <b>tab</b> <b>connections</b> have the potential to provide safer erection alternatives and materials savings if used in appropriate ways and with the right applications...|$|R

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a research}} investigation on connection details and bracing layouts for stability bracing of steel bridges with skewed supports. Cross-frames and diaphragms {{play an important}} role in stabilizing steel girders, particularly during construction. The commonly used bent plate connection between skewed braces and steel girders can introduce flexibility that can have detrimental effects on the bracing behavior. An alternative detail investigated in this study is a split pipe stiffener used to connect cross-frames to girders at a skew. The split pipe stiffener allows perpendicular connections to the cross-frame <b>connection</b> <b>tab,</b> regardless of the skew angle. The split pipe provides a stiffer connection between the cross-frame and the girder. More importantly, the split pipe stiffener increases the torsional stiffness of the girder by introducing substantial warping restraint. This increases the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the girder and allows the first line of intermediate cross-frames to be moved farther from the support. Overall, the increase in girder torsional stiffness and buckling capacity that results from the use of the split pipe stiffener will enhance the safety of the girder at all stages of construction: during transportation, lifting, erection, and placement of the concrete deck. This study also examined layout patterns for intermediate cross-frame...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 199) Members {{of space}} truss {{systems that are}} efficiently designed have an allowable load {{that is based on}} a primary failure mode such as long-column buckling. Local effects at the ends of the members should not be critical. A common truss member design is that of a thin-walled cylindrical tube with welded radially oriented <b>tabs</b> for bolted <b>connection</b> at the ends. In a typical truss arrangement these members are subjected to not only pure axial loading, but secondary transverse loading between the tabs. Local stress concentrations occur that may not only determine the allowable load on the member but may effect its overall stiffness.

The model was designed so as to allow for analysis of different tab orientations. Detailed plots of local stress fields and displacements show load distribution and areas of high stress concentration. Maximum stresses, stress concentration factors, and effective member stiffness considering end effects are presented for several common cylinder sizes. Published formulas, adapted to predict maximum local cylinder stresses and deflections, show reasonable agreement with model results.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional tubing instrumentation for measuring airflow, designers and technicians at the NASA Glenn Research Center have been fabricating packaging components and assembling a set of unique probes using commercial-off-the-shelf microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) integrated circuits (computer chips). Using MEMS as {{an alternative}} has some compelling advantages over standard measurement devices. Sensor technologies have matured through high-production usage in industries such as automotive and aircraft manufacturers. Currently, MEMS are the choice in applications such as tire pressure monitors, altimeters, pneumatic controls, cable leak detectors, and consumer appliances. Conventional instrumentation uses tubing buried in the model aerodynamic surfaces or wind tunnel walls. The measurements are made when pressure is introduced at the tube opening. The pressure then must travel the tubing for lengths ranging from 20 to hundreds of feet before reaching an electronic signal conditioner. This condition causes {{a considerable amount of}} damping and requires measurements to be made only after the test rig has reached steady-state operation. The electronic MEMS pressure sensor is able to take readings continuously under dynamic states in nearly real time. The use of stainless steel tubing for pressure measurements requires many tubes to be cleaned, cut to length, carefully installed, and delicately deburred and spliced for use. A cluster of a few hundred 1 / 16 -in. - (0. 0625 -in. -) diameter tubes (not uncommon in research testing facilities) can be several inches in diameter and may weigh enough to require two men to handle. Replacing hard tubing with electronic chips can eliminate much of the bulk. Each sensor would fit on the tip of the 1 / 16 -in. tubing with room to spare. The P 592 piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor (Lucas NovaSensor, Fremont, CA) was chosen for this project because of its cost, availability, and tolerance to extreme ambient conditions.

MEMS sensor technology has matured through mass production and use in the automotive and aircraft industries. At present, MEMS are the devices of choice for sensors in such applications as tire-pressure monitors, altimeters, pneumatic controls, cable leak detectors, and consumer appliances. Compactness, minimality of power demand, rugged construction, and moderate cost all contribute to making MEMS sensors attractive for instrumentation for future research. Conventional macroscopic flow-measurement instrumentation includes tubes buried beneath the aerodynamic surfaces of wind-tunnel models or in wind-tunnel walls. Pressure is introduced {{at the opening of}} each such tube. The pressure must then travel along the tube before reaching a transducer that generates an electronic signal. The lengths of such tubes typically range from 20 ft (approx. = 6 m) to hundreds of feet (of the order of 100 m). The propagation of pressure signals in the tubes damps the signals considerably and makes it necessary to delay measurements until after test rigs have reached steady-state operation. In contrast, a MEMS pressure sensor that generates electronic output can take readings continuously under dynamic conditions in nearly real time. In order to use stainless-steel tubing for pressure measurements, it is necessary to clean many tubes, cut them to length, carefully install them, delicately deburr them, and splice them.
