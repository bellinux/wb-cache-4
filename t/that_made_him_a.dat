5|$|Jervis {{was also}} {{recognised}} by {{both political and}} military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command {{with him when he}} took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} Czarniecki {{received}} territories from the king, {{along with the}} office of Crown oboźny. In 1653 he led a unit to Ukraine, ransacking much of the Cossack-held lands, although the attrition among the troops was high. During that campaign Czarniecki was wounded at Monastyryska. He continued his suppression campaign in 1654, and the following January took part in the battle of Okhmativ. In May 1655 he was called from Ukraine to Warsaw, as the king John Casimir Vasa, respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council, convened to discuss the looming thread of the war with Sweden. At that time his reputation was significant; Sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim Ukraine, and he was even held in much consideration by the Ottomans, then temporarily allied with the Commonwealth. On 14 May 1655 he received the office of the castellan of Kiev, a position <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> member of the Senate of Poland.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his career, Rypien {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as a tough and hardworking player. With the Canucks, he was a fourth-line forward, providing energy with his speed on the forecheck, aggression and fighting abilities – attributes <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> fan favourite throughout his junior and professional career, but also contributed to his injury troubles. He regularly fought players well above his weight and height, including Sheldon Brookbank (6-foot-2, 215 pounds) and Hal Gill (6-foot-7, 240 pounds).|$|E
25|$|After leaving {{government}} employment, Hagel co-founded Vanguard Cellular, {{a mobile}} phone service carrier <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> multi-millionaire. While working with Vanguard, {{he served as}} {{president and chief executive}} officer of the United Service Organizations and the Private Sector Council, as deputy director and chief operating officer of the 1990 G7 Summit, and on the board of directors or advisory committee of the American Red Cross, the Eisenhower World Affairs Institute, Bread for the World, and the Ripon Society. He also served as Chairman of the Agent Orange Settlement Fund and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.|$|E
25|$|Later {{on in the}} 1930s, Curry began wrestling in Detroit under {{promoter}} Adam Weissmuller (uncle of Johnny Weissmuller) {{who also}} trained him for his professional career. Curry stayed in Detroit for several years developing his brutal, hardcore style of wrestling <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> top name in the territory. Curry was so well known that he even faced legendary heavyweight pro boxer Jack Dempsey in an exhibition match in 1940. Years later Curry would often claim that he knocked Dempsey out in the match {{but the truth is}} that Curry was stopped in the second round.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013, Ashwin was {{victim of}} <b>an</b> {{accident}} <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> amputee. He {{participated in a}} marathon in Mumbai soon after the accident. He floated a petition to change the heights of platforms in Mumbai suburban train stations, that ended in victory.|$|R
50|$|On 20 November 1964 four monks were {{attacked}} in their cells by police {{and sent to}} prison on false charges. One of the monks {{was sent to a}} mental institution where he was given injections <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> invalid {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|R
5000|$|John Clute {{writes that}} [...] "McIntosh never lost the vivid {{narrative}} skills <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> interesting figure of 1950s sf, but {{his failure to}} challenge himself or his readers in his later career led to results that verged on mediocrity. His early work warrants revival".|$|R
25|$|It was {{his paper}} on the Eppes Convergence, which {{concerned}} asymptotics of Hermitian random matrices, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> star in his field. Following a seminar that heavily criticized this seminal piece many years after its initial publication, Charlie realized that his work with the FBI has prevented him from doing research significant to other mathematicians and now hopes to spend decades on cognitive emergence theory ("the mathematics of the brain") to rectify this certain inequity, which has delighted Fleinhardt. Although {{he was a child}} prodigy, Charlie now laments the fact that his best years in his research will never come ahead of schedule again.|$|E
25|$|Paige first {{played for}} the semi-{{professional}} Mobile Tigers from 1924 to 1926. He began his professional baseball career in 1926 with the Chattanooga Black Lookouts of the Negro Southern League {{and became one of}} the most famous and successful players from the Negro leagues. While his outstanding control as a pitcher first got him noticed, it was his infectious, cocky, enthusiastic personality and his love for the game <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> star. On town tours across the United States, Paige would sometimes have his infielders sit down behind him and then routinely strike out the side. He played his last professional game on June 21, 1966, for the Peninsula Grays of the Carolina League.|$|E
25|$|The {{independence}} of Ethiopia {{was interrupted by}} the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, beginning when it was invaded by Fascist Italy in early October 1935, and Italian occupation of the country (1936–1941). During this time, Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations in 1935, delivering an address <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> worldwide figure, and the 1935 Time Man of the Year. As {{the majority of the}} Ethiopian population lived in rural towns, Italy faced continued resistance and ambushes in urban centers throughout its occupation. Haile Selassie fled into exile in London and Mussolini was able to proclaim the Empire of Ethiopia and the assumption of the imperial title by the Italian king Vittorio Emanuele III, recognized by the countries belonging to the international organization of the League of Nations.|$|E

It was this love of America <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> authority on America." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Rafael Lucio was {{a long-time}} {{professor}} at the School of Medicine. In addition to his wisdom and vast experience, he showed an ease of expression and remarkable clarity in his classes; his unassuming manners, his kindness and his spotless morality must be added to this, all qualities <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> exemplary teacher.|$|R
25|$|For {{his defense}} of escaped slaves seized in Ohio under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793, Chase was dubbed the Attorney General for Fugitive Slaves. His {{argument}} {{in the case of}} Jonesv. Van Zandt on the constitutionality of fugitive slave laws before the U.S.Supreme Court attracted particular attention. In this and similar cases, the court ruled against him, and the judgment against John Van Zandt was upheld. Chase contended that slavery was local, not national, and that it could exist only by virtue of positive state law. He argued that the federal government was not empowered by the Constitution to create slavery anywhere and that when a slave leaves the jurisdiction of a state where slavery is legal, he ceases to be a slave; he continues to be a man and leaves behind the law <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> slave.|$|E
25|$|Uthman was {{a family}} man who {{apparently}} led a simple life even after becoming the Caliph of the Rashidun Empire and regardless {{of the fact that}} he was rich due to his flourishing family business. The caliphs were paid for their services from bait al-mal, the public treasury, but Uthman never took any salary for his service as a Caliph, as he was independently wealthy. Uthman was also a humanitarian: He developed a custom to free slaves every Friday, look after the widows and orphans, and give unlimited charity. His patience and endurance were among the characteristics <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> successful leader. As a way of taking care of Muhammad's wives, he doubled their allowances. Uthman wasn't completely plain and simple, however: Uthman built a Palace for himself in Medina, known as Al-Zawar, with a notable feature being doors of precious wood. Although Uthman paid for the palace with his own money, Shia Muslims considered it his first step towards ruling like a King.|$|E
25|$|A huge man, {{standing}} {{well over}} six feet tall and weighing more than 16 stone (102kg), Thompson was an excellent all-rounder. Despite his huge frame, his batting relied chiefly on a very watchful eye <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> very hard man to dismiss when pitches were hard and firm. Though at times he would hit very hard, he had very little backlift and could play only a restricted range of strokes, and his size made him rather slow of foot and hence seldom likely to make many runs on the numerous rain-affected pitches of his day. As a bowler, he was above medium pace and could gain a great deal of spin, which made him respected when pitches were hard and frequently unplayable after rain or on a crumbling pitch. His large hands and long reach made him an excellent fieldsman at slip: in 1914 he achieved the unequalled feat of taking three catches off consecutive balls against Warwickshire.|$|E
5000|$|Reagan {{said that}} it was his [...] "empathy" [...] with the American people <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> {{effective}} communicator and leader. Reagan was able to connect to people through storytelling. While this simple form of communicating led detractors such as Clark Clifford to label Reagan as [...] "an amiable dunce", Michael K. Deaver likened this dismissive attitude to a [...] "secret weapon." ...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, King Khalid {{was not an}} {{effective}} leader. Although {{he seemed to be}} reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. King Khalid is also considered to have been a genial caretaker during his reign. However, King Khalid failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some personal characteristics <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> respected king. Although he did not have an active interest in affairs of state and his health was not good, he was admired as an honest man who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country.|$|E
500|$|He {{married the}} girl in question, Margaret [...] "Polly" [...] Grubb, on April 13, 1933. Chronically short of money, he turned to {{full-time}} fiction writing to support himself and his new wife; six of his pieces were published commercially during 1932 to 1933 as he embarked on a literary career <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> somewhat well-known figure {{in the world of}} pulp magazine fiction.|$|E
500|$|Irwin, {{after his}} death, was {{described}} by Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland, as a [...] "modern-day Noah." [...] British naturalist David Bellamy lauded his skills as a natural historian and media performer. Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki paid tribute to Irwin, noting that [...] "umanity will not protect that which we fear or do not understand. Steve Irwin helped us understand those things that many people thought were a nuisance at best, a horror at worst. <b>That</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> great educator and conservationist." ...|$|E
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|R
50|$|Ruggieri left Europe with a {{group of}} missionaries which {{included}} Rudolph Acquaviva and Matteo Ricci. Arriving in India (September 1578), he promptly started to study the language used on the Malabar coast and in 6 months reached such proficiency that he could hear confession. It is probably this gift for language <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> ideal choice for the beginning of the Chinese mission.|$|R
5000|$|His {{history of}} winning cases {{and the large}} legal fees he is now able to command have put Cohen in the {{position}} of being able to choose the cases he wants to handle, including accepting clients that cannot afford his fees such as school teacher, Jennifer Porter. [...] Besides criminal matters, Cohen handles personal injury cases. [...] "The same investigative, negotiating and trial skills <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> outstanding defense lawyer also <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> excellent personal injury lawyer." ...|$|R
500|$|Biographers of Stanley characterise him {{as having}} an [...] "immensely active mind, and {{a strong sense of}} public duty" [...] and a [...] "great charm of manner and a sense of humour which {{concealed}} an almost ruthless determination" [...] <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> [...] "formidable negotiator". His [...] "intuitive understanding of his fellow men" [...] gave him [...] "presence, which allowed him to dominate meetings effortlessly" [...] and [...] "inspired loyalty, devotion even, among his staff". He was [...] "a dapper ladies' man, something of a playboy tycoon, who was always smartly turned out and enjoyed moving in high society".|$|E
500|$|Following his {{freshman}} season, Okafor {{was regarded as}} the second best college basketball prospect in the Chicago area behind Jabari Parker. The scouting report on him was that he possessed an improved midrange jump shot, nimble feet, soft hands and physical skills at [...] <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> mismatch against almost any high school competitor. Prior to his sophomore season Dave Spahn of SLAM Magazine described Okafor as a player with the footwork and ambidexterity to dominate his opponents, placing him in the conversation {{for the role of}} best player in the national class of 2014. In August 2011, ESPN ranked him as the third best player in the class of 2014.|$|E
500|$|After Sigappu Rojakkal, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of the thriller genre in Tamil cinema, as evidenced by films like Moodu Pani. According to film producer and writer G. Dhananjayan, the film [...] "inspired a generation to take up film-making". M. Suganth of The Times of India stated that Mahendra [...] "changed the landscape of Tamil cinema with his distinctive visuals and eclectic films" [...] such as Moodu Pani. Pothen recalled in January 2015 {{that it was the}} simultaneous release of Moodu Pani and his other film Varumayin Niram Sivappu <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> star. However, both Varumayin Niram Sivappu, which depicted Pothen as an eccentric director obsessed with an actress, and Moodu Pani led to him being typecast in similar roles. [...] "Both roles caught the public imagination, and I admit I cashed in when I was offered similar stuff. Now, unless I'm offered an unreasonable amount of money, I doubt I'll accept these roles," [...] he said in a 2014 interview.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 1983 season, Parker {{became a}} free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds.

In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a [...]312 batting average, 34 home runs, and 125 RBI. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee.|$|R
