25|$|The sudden {{nature of}} the {{complications}} of pre-existing atheroma, vulnerable plaque (non-occlusive or soft plaque), have led, since the 1950s, {{to the development of}} intensive care units and complex medical and surgical interventions. Angiography and later cardiac stress testing was begun to either visualize or indirectly detect stenosis. Next came bypass surgery, <b>to</b> <b>plumb</b> transplanted veins, sometimes arteries, around the stenoses and more recently angioplasty, now including stents, most recently drug coated stents, to stretch the stenoses more open.|$|E

500|$|To {{capitalize}} on Monk's popularity with intellectual and bohemian fans from venues {{such as the}} Five Spot Café, Riverside released Misterioso and reissues of his older records with designs referencing 20th century works of art. The album's cover art is a reproduction of Giorgio de Chirico's 1915 painting The Seer, which was originally painted {{as a tribute to}} French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Monk biographer Robin Kelley argued that, because Rimbaud had [...] "called on the artist to be a seer in order <b>to</b> <b>plumb</b> the depths of the unconscious in the quest for clairvoyance", the painting was the best choice for the cover: [...] "The one-eyed figure represented the visionary; the architectural forms and the placement of the chalkboard evoked the unity of art and science—a perfect symbol for an artist whose music has been called 'mathematical.'" [...] According to musicologist Robert G. O'Meally, the cover reflected [...] "the mysterious violations of convention of perspective, the silences, and oddly attractive angles (the overall futuristic quality) in Monk's music".|$|E
500|$|... "The Field Where I Died" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave [...] "The Field Where I Died" [...] a [...] "B+". He {{felt that it}} worked [...] "pretty well" [...] {{and there was a}} lot to appreciate about it, and while he noted that [...] "the episode isn't quite good enough for the conclusion to be as devastating as it should be", he still praised the tragic ending. However, he felt it not believable that Mulder quickly accepts his past lives and Melissa's part in it, and thought it would have worked better if he eased into believing it. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She called the entry [...] "unabashedly emotional episode" [...] that is [...] "unafraid <b>to</b> <b>plumb</b> the depths of human loss and grief". Furthermore, Vitaris praised Cloke's acting; she called her [...] "a truly gifted actor, slipping faultlessly into the skin of all of Melissa's personalities." [...] She was, however, more critical of Duchovny, noting that his hypnosis scene was underacted. Sarah Stegall, in The Munchkyn Zone, gave the episode a 5 out 5 rating. Stegall wrote that while the episode is [...] "drowned in tears and soaked in muted sunlight, [...] teeters on the brink of sentimentality", it manages [...] "to stay just this side of it for a dynamite, gripping episode that showcases some fine actors".|$|E

60|$|The {{psychology}} {{of a man}} of weak character {{under the influence of}} alcohol and disappointed ambition is not easy <b>to</b> <b>plumb,</b> for his moods follow one another with a rapidity which baffles the observer. Ten minutes before, Gerald Foster had been in the grip of a clammy self-pity, and it seemed from his aspect at the present moment that this phase had returned. But in the interval there had manifestly occurred a brief but adequate spasm of what would appear to have been an almost Berserk fury. What had caused it and why it should have expended itself so abruptly, Sally was not psychologist enough to explain; but that it had existed there was ocular evidence of the most convincing kind. A heavy niblick, flung petulantly--or remorsefully--into a corner, showed by what medium the destruction had been accomplished.|$|E

60|$|In short, I know nothing, {{except that}} my {{existence}} has been intertangled {{with one of}} the great mysteries of the world; that the glorious being called Ayesha won the secret of life from whatever power holds it in its keeping; that she alleged--although of this, remember, we have no actual proof--such life was to be attained by bathing in a certain emanation, vapour or essence; that she was possessed by a passion not easy to understand, but terrific in its force and immortal in its nature, concentrated upon one other being and one alone. That through this passion also some angry fate smote her again, again, and yet again, making of her countless days a burden, and leading the power and the wisdom which knew all but could foreknow nothing, into abysses of anguish, suspense, and disappointment such as--Heaven be thanked!--we common men and women are not called upon <b>to</b> <b>plumb.</b>|$|E
60|$|On earth, very probably, {{that deep}} affection {{would have become}} subject to the natural {{influences}} of weakening and decay; and, in the instance {{of a man and}} woman, the soul-possessing passion might have passed, {{to be replaced by a}} more moderate, custom-worn affection. But the dead are beyond the reach of those mouldering fingers. There they stand, perfect and unalterable, with arms which never cease from beckoning, with a smile that never grows less sweet. Come storm, come shine, nothing can tarnish the pure and gleaming robes in which our vision clothes them. We know the worst of them; their faults and failings cannot vex us afresh, their errors are all forgiven. It is their best part only that remains unrealised and unread, their purest aspirations which we follow with leaden wings, their deepest thoughts that we still strive <b>to</b> <b>plumb</b> with the short line of our imagination or experience, and to weigh in our imperfect balances.|$|E

Felipe came to my bedside with obvious cheerfulness; as I passed through the court the Señora was sunning herself with her accustomed immobility; and when I issued from the gateway I found the whole face of nature austerely smiling, the heavens of a cold blue, and sown with great cloud islands, and the mountain-sides mapped forth into provinces of light and shadow. A short walk restored me to myself, and renewed within me the resolve <b>to</b> <b>plumb</b> this mystery; and when, from the vantage of my knoll, I had seen Felipe pass forth to his labours in the garden, I returned at once to the residencia to put my design in practice. The Señora appeared plunged in slumber; I stood a while and marked her, but she did not stir; even if my design were indiscreet, I had little to fear from such a guardian; and turning away, I mounted to the gallery and began my exploration of the house.|$|E
