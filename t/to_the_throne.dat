5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E
5|$|According to custom, pretenders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> had {{historically}} {{been put to}} death upon the naming of a new sovereign. Radama was opposed to this practice and asked the brothers to help ensure his accession <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> with minimum bloodshed {{on the day of}} the queen's death. Rainilaiarivony successfully maintained authority over the palace guards anxiously awaiting the command from either faction to slaughter the other. When the queen's attendant quietly informed him that her final moments were approaching, Rainilaiarivony discreetly summoned Radama and Rainivoninahitriniony from the Prime Minister's palace to the royal Rova compound and ordered the prince crowned before the gathered soldiers, just as the queen was pronounced dead. Ramboasalama was promptly escorted to the palace where he was obliged to publicly swear allegiance to King Radama.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E

Edward lived a lavish lifestyle, however, including giving a huge gift of money to the exiled Charles II shortly before his restoration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> and later entertaining the royal court at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in 1673. Edward later fell out with the king over the proposal that the Roman Catholic James II should succeed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> on Charles's death, and after {{the discovery of the}} Rye House Plot in 1683 the castle was searched by royal officials looking for stocks of weapons that might be used in a possible revolt.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1350 or 1351, Ivan Shishman was {{the eldest}} son of emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) and his second wife Sarah–Theodora, a Jew {{converted}} to the Eastern Orthodox Church. His birth brought {{up the issue of}} the succession to the Bulgarian throne. Ivan Shishman had two elder brothers by the Ivan Alexander's first wife, Theodora of Wallachia. The eldest one, Michael Asen, was proclaimed successor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> and co-emperor shortly after Ivan Alexander's accession <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> However, Michael Asen's early death in battle against the Ottomans in 1355 put forward the question of succession once more. It is likely that Sarah–Theodora pressured Ivan Alexander to select her own son as his successor, although Ivan Sratsimir would have come next under the majorat system. The issue was decided in Ivan Shishman's favour because the latter was born in the purple (after his father was crowned), thus making him eligible as successor. By the end of 1355, Ivan Shishman had been proclaimed heir <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> and co-emperor.|$|E
