5|$|Snow in {{the city}} is so rare {{that it has been}} {{observed}} only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept.

5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson looking {{to close the}} {{distance}} early. Jackson immediately went for a double-leg takedown, and picked Silva up. Silva then locked his legs, creating a standing closed guard, and applied a guillotine choke. The two stayed in this position until Jackson loosened his own grip, taking the fight to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the first time, with Silva holding onto the chokehold.|$|E
5|$|The ground hosted East Stirlingshire's first Scottish Football League {{match in}} 1900–01 {{which ended in}} a 3–2 defeat to Airdrieonians.

5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Alefeld (1820–1872), {{who used}} Latin variety names, in a {{monographic}} study of beans, lentils and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories: Unterart (subspecies), Varietäten Gruppe and Kultur-Varietät, all with Latin names. In doing this {{he was probably}} laying <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group. In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.|$|E
5|$|From 1909 to 1922, Juventus {{played their}} {{internal}} competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving {{the following year}} to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles.

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 the Queen's Park Oval hosted England and saw West Indian {{victory by}} an innings, {{followed}} by a draw against India in 1982. The first One-Day International at the ground took place between India and the West Indies in March 1983, with the hosts taking a comfortable victory. Australia, New Zealand and England all visited <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> Test and ODI games during 1985 and 1986, faring poorly. The decade ended with tours by Pakistan and India, mixed with matches from the now entitled Red Stripe Cup, the new name for the West Indian domestic first-class competition.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of their performances during the game, North Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team, and Virginia Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen was named the most valuable player of the losing team. Keldorf finished the game having completed 12 of his 28 pass attempts for 290 yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Sorensen completed four of eight passes for 24 yards and carried the ball 10 times on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> a total of 19 yards. Al Clark, the quarterback whom Sorensen replaced, finished the game having completed nine of 17 pass attempts for 66 yards.|$|E

5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} from Kyle in South Carolina {{peaked at}} 6.35inches (161mm) in Edisto Beach, with the precipitation resulting in minor urban flooding. In and around St. Stephen, flooding reached several feet in depth in roads and buildings; there, {{a nursing home}} had to be evacuated because of flooding. High waters in Manning severely damaged 17mobile homes, forcing about 50people to move to shelters. Ten car accidents were reported in Florence. The tropical storm spawned an F2 tornado in Georgetown that remained on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> about 1.25miles (2km). At its peak strength, the tornado overturned five mobile homes and a car. The tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged 106buildings, 28severely. Eight people were injured by the tornado.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after {{getting hit by}} an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> filming.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw {{the number}} of {{supporters}} falling {{to some of the}} ground's lowest levels. The lowest ever attendance at Prenton Park was on 20 February 1984, when only 937 supporters watched a 2–0 victory over Halifax Town. However, the decade also saw a high number of supporters in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> other reasons. In the Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool F.C. fans lost their lives and, on 15 April 1989, 12,000 people attended a memorial service at Prenton Park.|$|E

5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Frenchman’s Creek {{took place}} during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States {{in the early hours of}} November 28, 1812, in the Crown Colony of Upper Canada, near the Niagara River. The {{operation}} was conceived as a raid to prepare <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> a larger American invasion. The Americans succeeded in crossing the Niagara and landing at both of their points of attack. They achieved one of their two objectives before withdrawing but the invasion was subsequently called off, rendering useless what had been accomplished. The engagement was named, “the Battle of Frenchman’s Creek” by the Canadians, after the location of some of the severest fighting. To contemporary Americans, it was known as, “the Affair opposite Black Rock”.|$|E
