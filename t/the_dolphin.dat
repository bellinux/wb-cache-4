5|$|Tião was a {{well-known}} solitary female Bottlenose Dolphin that was first spotted {{in the town}} of São Sebastião in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed humans to interact with her. <b>The</b> <b>dolphin</b> became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which later earned her the nickname killer dolphin.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} short-finned pilot whale, the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin.

5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse <b>the</b> <b>dolphins.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> are in <b>the</b> bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> cannot escape. <b>The</b> <b>dolphins</b> are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> are caught one by one and killed.|$|R

5|$|The family Lipotidae {{is another}} {{monotypic}} taxon, containing only the baiji. Fossil records suggest <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> first appeared 25 {{million years ago}} and migrated from the Pacific Ocean to the Yangtze River 20 million years ago.

The town is strongly associated with the electronic music group Underworld.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, {{and analysis of the}} skulls {{is the best way to}} distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> family are also known as blackfish.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{released}} a combined, semi-portable Genesis/Sega CD unit called the Genesis CDX (marketed as the Multi-Mega in Europe). This unit retailed at $399.95 in the U.S. (roughly $100 {{more than the}} individual Genesis and Sega CD units put together, since the Sega CD dropped its price to $229 half a year before), and was bundled with Sonic CD, Sega Classics Arcade Collection, and the Sega CD version of Ecco <b>the</b> <b>Dolphin.</b> The CDX features a small LCD screen that, when the unit is used to play audio CDs, displays the current track being played.

5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{hours after}} the Dolphins' game against the Cincinnati Bengals, <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> {{suspended}} Incognito indefinitely for conduct detrimental to <b>the</b> team. <b>The</b> <b>Dolphins</b> also asked <b>the</b> NFL to join their own internal investigation of the matter. According to Schefter, the final straw for <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> was a highly graphic voicemail Incognito left in April 2013, in which Incognito called Martin a [...] "half-nig*er piece of s*it," [...] threatened to slap Martin's mother across the face and even uttered a death threat against Martin. Until then, <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> had publicly maintained the charges against Incognito were pure speculation. Schefter said that {{as late as the}} afternoon of November 3, <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> didn't even know the voicemail existed. Within hours of hearing the tape, Schefter said, <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> had suspended Incognito. The next day, a <b>Dolphins</b> source told <b>The</b> Miami Herald that Incognito would never play another down for <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> again, and that the team intended to cut ties with him at the earliest opportunity.|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the coat of arms {{originated}} in a seal from the late 14th century and were recorded by Clarenceux King of Arms during the heraldic visitation of Dorset in 1563. The wavy bars of black and gold represent the sea and <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> is sign of Poole's maritime interests.

5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E

5|$|The Genesis {{library was}} {{initially}} modest, but eventually grew to contain games {{to appeal to}} all types of players. The initial pack-in title was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog. Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog, its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Disney's Aladdin. During development for the console, Sega Enterprises in Japan focused on developing action games while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A {{large part of the}} appeal of the Genesis library during the console's lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, as well as more difficult entries such as Ecco <b>the</b> <b>Dolphin</b> and sports games such as Joe Montana Football. Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with several scenes interspersing, {{starting}} with Carey underwater, while holding onto a dolphins fin, {{as well as}} Carey lying on a beach at night in a bikini.

Carey then is shown inside a small cabana, singing to the camera and enjoying herself at a small party. Similar scenes of Carey in a gold bikini are shown, {{as well as more}} scenes of Hawaiian landscape.
