Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E

25|$|If a {{vaccination}} program successfully reduces the disease threat, it {{may reduce the}} perceived risk of disease as cultural memories {{of the effects of}} that disease fade. At this point, parents may feel <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to lose by not vaccinating their children. If enough people hope to become free-riders, gaining the benefits of herd immunity without vaccination, vaccination levels may drop to a level where herd immunity ceases to be as effective.|$|E

25|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} sleeps {{several times in}} a 24-hour cycle. Monophasic sleep occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> better to do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{meaningful}} alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, {{do not possess}} adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or {{the quality of education}} is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.|$|E
25|$|Charangas supplanted the típica as the {{standard}} instrumental line-up for the danzón. Initially called charangas francesas (though <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with France), they were 'invented' {{at the start of}} the 20th century. The formulation is still going strong, with appropriate adjustments to the instrumentation. The basic idea is to pitch the tone of the orchestra higher and brighter than the típica, by removing the brass, replacing the clarinet with a flute and replacing the kettle drums with a new invention, the pailas criollas, now called timbales. This metal-cased drum, hit with timbales sticks, and not timpani sticks, produces a distinctive effect. The two timbales drums are pitched differently, and may be supplemented with two timbalitos, pitched even higher, and one or two cencerros (cowbells). Also noteworthy is the use of the sticks on the metal casing to produce a rhythm known as the cascara. From early on these bands also included a piano. The overall effect is to produce a lighter, brighter flavor to the music; who actually originated the idea is not known.|$|E

25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E
500|$|For {{teams that}} {{face each other}} frequently, players may fight just to send {{the message to the}} {{opposing}} players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games. Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights {{near the end of the}} game when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to lose. Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a [...] "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.|$|E

The band also clarified that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> against men. As Rootes notes, [...] "Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men." [...] The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band. Rootes told Select: [...] "So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman." ...|$|E

500|$|The plot of Man of Steel {{employs a}} {{nonlinear}} narrative, and tells {{parts of the}} story in flashback. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A {{lot of people have}} approached Superman {{in a lot of different}} ways. I only know the way that has worked for us that's what I know how to do," [...] emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film. [...] "Each serves to the internal logic of the story. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with each other." [...] Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series.|$|E

It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions {{that he was the}} power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: [...] "People say I’m a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are the people who came in {{to pick up the pieces}} after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give up because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to eat." [...] Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: [...] "A country that’s not capable of discussing its own problems — it's not a country, it's not a state." ...|$|E

6000|$|Hence I gather these conclusions--1. That {{men that}} are wedded {{to their own}} righteousness {{understand}} not {{the doctrine of the}} forgiveness of sins. This is manifested by the poor Pharisee; he objected against the woman because she was a sinner. 2. Let Pharisees murmur still, yet Christ hath pity and mercy for sinners. 3. Yet Jesus doth not usually manifest mercy until the sinner hath nothing to pay. 'And when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to pay, he frankly,' or freely, or heartily, 'forgave them both.' If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to pay, then they were sinners; but he forgiveth no man but with respect to a righteousness; therefore that righteousness must be another's; for in the very act of mercy they are found sinners. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> but debt, nothing but sin, nothing to pay [with]. Then they were 'justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.' So, then, 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.' ...|$|R
