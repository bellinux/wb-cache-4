5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While the sleeves of musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed the moat and also started <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E
25|$|The City Hall was at 295 Concord Avenue (Concord is the town's main north-south street). It {{is open to}} {{the public}} 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Visitors are invited <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> and sign the town's guestbook. City Hall was built in the early 1900s as a {{community}} church. Later it was a Baptist church. From 1914 to 1946 it was the Evangelical church, from 1946 to 1968 the Evangelical United Brethren church, and from 1968 until closing in 1997 it was the Tenney United Methodist Church. The building was purchased by the city for $11 in 1999, and in 2006-07 underwent significant renovation and expansion.|$|E
25|$|In February 2002, Takahashi {{released}} his debut album, the self-produced Sepia, of which only 200 copies were produced. Over {{the next five}} years, Takahashi performed concerts and released albums based in Sapporo, such as in January 2004, when he performed street lives five times per week. In May 2007, he {{released his}} second album, Mugon no Bōryoku, limited to 500 copies. The album was relatively popular in Sapporo, charting at number 1 for three weeks at the Sapporo Stellar Place HMV's in-store independent releases charts. This lead him to hold his first solo concert, to 200 people at the Sapporo Colony. In September 2007, Takahashi began performing monthly live concerts titled , {{in which he would}} rent a CD shop and only allow 30 people <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> for the concert.|$|E

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice session were held, two one-and-a-half-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. At the first session, both Mercedes drivers were fastest, with Nico Rosberg being three-tenths {{of a second}} faster than teammate Lewis Hamilton. The Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{was the only other}} car <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> one second of the Mercedes. The other Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel set the slowest lap time, as a gearbox problem prevented him from driving more than four laps. The McLaren of Fernando Alonso suffered from gearbox issues as well, but the Spaniard was able {{to get back on track}} for the later part of the session. The team had brought a new aerodynamics package to Spielberg, which was tested by Alonso in free practice, who described it as [...] "an improvement to the car".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continue}} their {{investigation into the}} murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson. They repeatedly comb through the crime scene and conduct arrests and interrogations throughout the neighborhood, but they fail to find anything new. A frustrated Bayliss snaps at Pembleton, prompting Pembleton to request a new partner, but Gee refuses and remains confident Bayliss will solve the Watson case. Elsewhere, while Bolander (Ned Beatty) prepares for a date with medical examiner Blythe (Wendy Hughes), he complains to his neighbor Lorenzo Molera (Luis Guzmán) about noise he is making while doing his carpenter work. The two end up bonding over beers, with both confiding in each other about their ex-wives. Inside Molera's room is a coffin he built for a customer, which Bolander insists is bad luck. Bolander's date with Blythe goes well, but he nervously rejects an invitation back to her apartment when he receives a call about a murder. The call brings him back to Molera, who has been found dead inside his coffin. Bolander tells the investigating police that Molera died of [...] "a broken heart". Inspired by his deceased neighbor, Bolander returns to Blythe and asks <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> after all.|$|E

Cosick is about <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> when a boy on the street accidentally turns on a spotlight that blinds Robert, and he falls from the ledge. He manages to grab a net that the police had stealthily put below him, and he is hauled into the hotel. Dunnigan is greeted by his wife and son, and Danny and Ruth walk the street hand in hand.|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{the major}} {{metropolitan}} cities, few stores {{could afford to}} serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations {{that would allow them}} to separate wealthier customers from the [...] "riff raff." [...] One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. [...] This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside.</b> Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack. The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.|$|E
2500|$|Just before 11 on {{the night}} of August 8, 1898, Lt. Atwater thought he saw moving figures in white, {{on the edge of the}} woods 250 yards from the lighthouse. At 1145, with {{moonlight}} breaking through the clouds, he saw several men in the brush on the edge of the woods. Without giving an alarm, he instructed the lookouts to be on heightened vigilance. As he was heading to the yard gate to order the corporal of the guard and sentry <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> the light-house, those men came running up and announced they had seen Spanish troops in the road. Almost immediately, a volley of gunfire erupted from the surrounding woods. [...] Atwater ordered the lighthouse lamp doused as a signal to the three armed ships lying offshore that the light-house was under attack. The cruiser, , the only ship with an operable searchlight, trained it on the hill where the lighthouse sat in order to direct secondary battery gunfire from Cincinnati, Amphitrite and Leyden on the attacking Spanish troops.|$|E

50|$|John William Warde was a 26-year-old {{native of}} Southampton, New York who {{committed}} suicide on July 26, 1938. He leaped {{from a window}} ledge of the 17th floor of the Gotham Hotel. This case of suicide is famous because an estimated crowd of 10,000 gathered below to watch the events and 400 police officers were also present to try and convince him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>inside.</b> The 1951 motion picture Fourteen Hours {{is based on the}} events of that day.|$|R
2500|$|Outside the walls, Warden Powell {{was busy}} {{trying to deal with}} budding public {{reaction}} to the riot. [...] The word had leaked quickly, and wives of guards who were hostages started showing up at his house. [...] Powell decided to again enter the prison through the tunnel system which gave access to the gun ports in the mess hall and the catwalks in the cellblocks. [...] Luckily, the riot leaders had been unable to secure a key to the access points to this tunnel system, or else Powell may have been taken hostage again. [...] Just after sundown, Powell made his way through the tunnels to the mess hall and shouted for Myles and Smart. [...] Myles showed up, leading Jones with a knife at his throat. [...] Powell asked what Myles wanted, and received a verbal tirade from Myles, who stalked away, leaving Jones with Alton. [...] Powell was told that Myles wanted at least thirty members of the press <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> the prison, take pictures of the conditions and speak with the inmates. [...] Powell offered to get three reporters inside the walls under the understanding that they would not print a word of what they learned until the hostages were released. [...] Alton agreed to the plan. [...] Powell returned to his residence to await the coming day.|$|E

50|$|One {{example of}} a {{specialized}} communication product is a bone conduction speaker {{that is used by}} scuba divers. The device is a rubber over-moulded, piezoelectric flexing disc that is approximately 40 mm across and 6 mm thick. A connecting cable is moulded into the disc, resulting in a tough, waterproof assembly. In use, the speaker is strapped against one of the dome-shaped bone protrusions behind the ear and the sound, which can be surprisingly clear and crisp, seems <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from <b>inside</b> the user's head.|$|R

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{parallels}} are perhaps with the Biblical and post-Biblical narrative of John the Baptist. Here we find {{not only a}} beheading, but a problematic marriage (with suggestions of incest rather than exogamy), defiant denunciation of tyranny, a centrally-important young woman and presentation of the head to a third party. Here, however, {{the threat to the}} faith community seems <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from <b>inside.</b> The thematic parallel, nevertheless, was strong enough for the builders to back St Valerie's shrine in St Michel des Lions with a fine stained glass window depicting John the Baptist.|$|R
