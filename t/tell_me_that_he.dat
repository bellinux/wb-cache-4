500|$|The nostalgic [...] "Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park)" [...] {{contains}} a Reuben Wilson sample, which comprises {{the sound of}} a Hammond organ, guitar, vocals and percussion, and adds to the track's ghostly harmonies. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the lyrics evoke [...] "the crossroads of Old School and New School." [...] "One Love" [...] is composed of a series of letters to incarcerated friends, recounting mutual acquaintances and events that have occurred since the receiver's imprisonment, and address unfaithful girlfriends, emotionally tortured mothers, and underdog loyalty. The phrase [...] "one love" [...] signifies street loyalty in the song. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastises a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> liked my style [...] Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Produced by Q-Tip, [...] "One Love" [...] samples the double bass and piano from the Heath Brothers' [...] "Smilin' Billy Suite Part II" [...] (1975) and the drum break from Parliament's [...] "Come In Out the Rain" [...] (1970), complementing the track's mystical and hypnotic soundscape.|$|E
2500|$|Among those {{referenced}} in {{the song}} was fellow Queensbridge-based rapper Cormega ("And night time is more trife than ever/What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?"). Cormega's rapping career had been put on hold due to his incarceration during the early 1990s, before his release in 1995. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastizes a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> liked my style ... Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Music writer Susan Weinstein wrote that [...] "the literary technique Nas most strongly excels in {{is the one that}} would seem to be most pedestrian: rhyme", and cited [...] "One Love" [...] as the first display of Nas's [...] "formal inventiveness".|$|E

Winston Churchill reported in his book The Gathering Storm (1948) that Hitler appointed Papen for [...] "the undermining or winning over of leading personalities in Austrian politics". Churchill also quoted the United States ambassador in Vienna as saying of Papen that [...] "in the boldest and most cynical manner... Papen proceeded to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that...</b> <b>he</b> intended to use {{his reputation as a}} good Catholic to gain influence with Austrians like Cardinal Innitzer." [...] In 1935, Papen's major fear was with international attention focused on the impeding Italian invasion of Ethiopia and Czechoslovakia in crisis after the Nazi front organization the Sudeten Home Front won the majority of the volksdeutsch vote in the elections, that Schuschnigg might attempt a Habsburg restoration. On 11 July 1935, Papen handed a note to the Austrians offering a normalization of Austro-German relations where Berlin would order the Austrian Nazis to cease engaging in terrorism in return for Austrian support for German foreign policy. On 28 August 1935, Papen negotiated a deal under which the German press would cease its attacks on the Austrian fascist regime, in return for which the Austrian press would cease its attacks on the German fascist regime. On 1 October 1935, the Austrians indicated their interest in taking up Papen's note from July, but Papen pursued the subsequent talks in a [...] "dilatory" [...] manner as Hitler wanted to see what changes in the international order the Italo-Ethiopian war might cause before signing anything. In the same time, Papen was also offered advice to Hitler on other matters. On 12 March 1936, Papen told Sir Walford Selby, the British ambassador to Austria that Hitler's offer to return to the League of Nations in exchange for Anglo-French acceptance of the remilitarization of the Rhineland was his idea. In March 1936, the Austro-German talks gathered speed as the German support for Italy's aggression against Ethiopia improved Italo-German relations {{to such an extent that}} Schuschnigg became desperate for any sort of deal that might save his country's existence. At this point, Papen informed Schuschnigg that he wanted to see members of the [...] "national opposition" [...] included in the Austrian cabinet as the price for a deal ensuring Austria's existence. To provide further pressure on Schuschnigg, Papen had the German embassy start subsidizing the right wing of the Austrian trade union movement, the Freiheitsbund, which staged anti-Semitic and pro-German demonstrations in Vienna and other Austrian cities.|$|E
