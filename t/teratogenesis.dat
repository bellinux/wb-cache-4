50|$|Terato means {{monster in}} Greek. Until the 18th century, the preformism theory was {{accepted}} by which abnormal growth was considered as deformations. The 19th century saw developmental in descriptive embryology where abnormalities were now considered as malformations or errors during a developmental process giving rise {{to the concept of}} <b>teratogenesis.</b> By the 20th century, the concept of epigenesis the interaction between a genetic program and environment was established and {{in the second half of}} the 20th century researchers had evidence that environmental factors can cause malformations and even trans-generational effects.|$|E
50|$|Toxication or toxification is the {{conversion}} of a chemical compound into a more toxic form in living organisms or in substrates such as soil or water. The conversion {{can be caused by}} enzymatic metabolism in the organisms, as well as by abiotic chemical reactions. While the parent drug are usually less active, both the parent drug and its metabolite can be chemically active and cause toxicity, leading to mutagenesis, <b>teratogenesis,</b> and carcinogenesis. Different classes of enzymes, such as P450-monooxygenases, epoxide hydrolase, or acetyltransferases can catalyze the process in the cell, mostly in the liver.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{effects of}} {{ionizing}} radiation {{on human health}} are stochastic, meaning that their probability of occurrence increases with dose, while the severity is independent of dose. Radiation-induced cancer, <b>teratogenesis,</b> cognitive decline, and heart disease are all examples of stochastic effects. Other conditions such as radiation burns, acute radiation syndrome, chronic radiation syndrome, and radiation-induced thyroiditis are deterministic, meaning they reliably occur above a threshold dose, and their severity increases with dose. [...] Deterministic effects are not necessarily more or less serious than stochastic effects; either can ultimately lead to a temporary nuisance or a fatality.|$|E

50|$|Wilson's 6 principlesAlong {{with this}} new {{awareness}} of the in utero vulnerability of the developing mammalian embryo came the development and refinement of The Six Principles of Teratology which are still applied today. These principles of teratology were put forth by Jim Wilson in 1959 and in his monograph Environment and Birth Defects.8 These principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms:Susceptibility to <b>teratogenesis</b> depends on the genotype of the conceptus {{and the manner in}} which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.Susceptibility to <b>teratogenesis</b> varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents.Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events.The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes.There are four manifestations of deviant development (Death, Malformation, Growth Retardation and Functional Defect).Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% Lethality (LD100).|$|E
50|$|Its {{most common}} impact is the {{stochastic}} induction of cancer with a latent {{period of years}} or decades after exposure. The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits {{that the incidence of}} cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert. If this linear model is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second. Other stochastic effects of ionizing radiation are <b>teratogenesis,</b> cognitive decline, and heart disease.|$|E
50|$|F. grandis {{populations in}} the highly {{polluted}} waters of the Houston Ship Channel were recently found to have adapted to resist {{the effects of the}} pollution. This resistance confers protection to embryos of these populations from cardiac <b>teratogenesis</b> (developmental deformities in the heart) compared to embryos from reference and un-contaminated populations. Further, the adapted populations of Gulf killifish seem to also be more resistant to pesticides, oxidative stress, and have a higher metabolism, which could be stemming from the strong selection that these organisms have been under to develop resistance to strong contamination. This strong resistance and cross-resistance suggests the role of adaptation to anthropogenic contaminants in this environment. Such events are widespread in many fish species and populations.|$|E

5000|$|Radioactive {{nanoparticles}} {{combine the}} hazards of radioactive materials with {{the hazards of}} nanomaterials. Inhalation exposure {{is the most common}} route of exposure to airborne particles in the workplace. Animal studies on some classes of nanoparticles indicate pulmonary effects including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis, which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known fibrogenic materials such as silica, asbestos, and ultrafine carbon black. Some studies in cells or animals have shown genotoxic or carcinogenic effects, or systemic cadiovascular effects from pulmonary exposure. [...] The hazards of ionizing radiation depend on whether the exposure is acute or chronic, and includes effects like radiation-induced cancer and <b>teratogenesis.</b> [...] In some cases, the inherent physicochemical toxicity of the nanoparticle itself may lead to lower exposure limits than those associated with the radioactivity alone, which is not the case with most radioactive materials.|$|E
50|$|Adding {{compounds}} {{to developing}} embryos allow comprehension of {{mechanism of action}} of drugs, their toxicity and developmental processes involving their targets. Chemical screens have been mostly performed on either wild type or transgenic Xenopus and zebrafish organisms as they produce {{a large amount of}} synchronized, fast-to-develop and transparent eggs easy to visually score. The use of chemicals in developmental biology offers two main advantages. Firstly, it is easy to perform high-throughput screen using wide spectrum or specific target compounds and reveal important genes or pathways involved in developmental processes. Secondly, it allows narrowing the time of action of a particular gene. It can also be used as a tool in drug development to test toxicity in whole organism. Procedures such as FETAX (Frog Embryo <b>Teratogenesis</b> Assay - Xenopus) are being developed to implement chemical screenings to test toxicity. Zebrafish and Xenopus embryos have also been used to identify new drugs targeting a particular gene of interest.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} the 17th century, {{teratology}} referred to a discourse on prodigies and marvels of anything so extraordinary as to seem abnormal. In the 19th century it acquired a meaning {{more closely related to}} biological deformities, mostly in the field of botany. Currently, its most instrumental meaning is that of the medical study of <b>teratogenesis,</b> congenital malformations or individuals with significant malformations. Historically, people have used many pejorative terms to describe/label cases of significant physical malformations.In the 1960s David W. Smith of the University of Washington Medical School (one of the researchers who became known in 1973 for the discovery of fetal alcohol syndrome), popularized the term teratology. With the growth of understanding of the origins of birth defects, the field of teratology [...] overlaps with other fields of science, including developmental biology, embryology, and genetics.Until the 1940s teratologists regarded birth defects as primarily hereditary. In 1941 the first well-documented cases of environmental agents being the cause of severe birth defects were reported.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{field of}} activity associated with drug safety is increasingly government-regulated, and is of major concern for the public, {{as well as to}} drug manufacturers. The distinction between adverse and nonadverse effects is a major undertaking when a new drug is developed and tested before marketing it. This is done in toxicity studies to determine the nonadverse effect level (NOAEL). These studies are used to define the dosage to be used in human testing (phase I), as well as to calculate the maximum admissible daily intake. Imperfections in clinical trials, such as insufficient number of patients or short duration, sometimes lead to public health disasters, such as those of fenfluramine (the so-called fen-phen episode), thalidomide and, more recently, of cerivastatin (Baycol, Lipobay) and rofecoxib (Vioxx), where drastic adverse effects were observed, such as <b>teratogenesis,</b> pulmonary hypertension, stroke, heart disease, neuropathy, and a significant number of deaths, causing the forced or voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market.|$|E
