5|$|Batwoman {{was created}} by writer Edmond Hamilton and artist Sheldon Moldoff under the {{direction}} of editor Jack Schiff, as part of an ongoing effort to expand Batman's cast of supporting characters. Batwoman began appearing in DC Comics stories beginning with Detective Comics #233 (1956), in which she was introduced as a love interest for Batman in order to combat the allegations of Batman's homosexuality arising from the controversial book Seduction of the Innocent (1954). When Julius Schwartz became editor of the Batman-related comic books in 1964, he removed non-essential characters including Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Bat-Mite, and Bat-Hound. Later, the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths retroactively established that Batwoman had never existed, <b>though</b> <b>her</b> alter ego Kathy Kane continued to be referred to occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Carson rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications. <b>Though</b> <b>her</b> position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities.

That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E

5|$|In Goa, Mohini is worshipped as Mahalasa or Mahalasa Narayani. She is the Kuladevi (family goddess) of many Hindus {{from western}} and {{southern}} India, including Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivajnas and Bhandaris. The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol, Goa, <b>though</b> <b>her</b> temples also {{exist in the}} states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a drinking bowl. She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu-matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the Bhavishya Purana.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser Barbarossa {{served with}} the German navy from her {{commissioning}} in 1901, <b>though</b> <b>her</b> active career was limited by two lengthy stays in dry dock.

She returned to service for another two years, before being decommissioned in 1909 {{and placed in the}} Reserve Division. She continued to participate in fleet training exercises for the next three years.|$|E

Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet.

5|$|After {{making her}} way to New York, West Gate took on 6,700 tons of cargo that {{included}} locomotives, steel rails, and other materiel for the United States Army and departed in a convoy for France on 28 June. The ship soon developed engine trouble and {{dropped out of the}} convoy to head to St. John's, Newfoundland, for repairs. While headed to St. John's in moderate seas under a cloudy sky, West Gate was attacked by two German submarines at 19:15 on 3 July. One U-boat surfaced in front of the cargo ship, crossing to starboard. As West Gate quickly turned to port to evade the U-boat, a second U-boat surfaced one point to starboard. While West Gates radio operator sent out a preemptive SOS, her gunners opened fire on the two submarines. <b>Though</b> <b>her</b> gunners made hits on neither boat, both were bracketed with fire, quickly submerged, and apparently departed the scene. West Gate arrived at St. John's at 18:00 on 7 July without any further contact with enemy vessels.|$|E

5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that <b>though</b> <b>her</b> behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. <b>Though</b> <b>her</b> doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
5|$|Callie Torres is {{introduced}} as an orthopedic surgery resident with {{a crush on}} intern George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). The two start a relationship and Torres moves into Meredith's house (Meredith and Izzie Stevens lived there as well). Uneased at the way their relationship is progressing, O'Malley confronts her, which results in her moving into a hotel. In {{the aftermath of the}} breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas {{on the spur of the}} moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. <b>Though</b> <b>her</b> personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter.|$|E
