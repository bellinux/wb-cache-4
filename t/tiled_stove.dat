60|$|It {{was late}} at night, {{and outside the}} prairie lay white and utterly silent under the Arctic cold, when Maud Barrington, who glanced at it through the double windows, flung back the {{curtains}} with a little shiver, and turning towards the fire, {{sat down on a}} little velvet footstool beside her aunt's knee. She had shaken out the coils of lustrous brown hair which flowed about her shoulders glinting {{in the light of the}} shaded lamp, and it was with a little gesture of physical content she stretched her hands towards the hearth. A crumbling birch log still gleamed redly amidst the feathery ashes, but its effect was chiefly artistic, for no open fire could have dissipated the cold of the prairie, and a big <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> brought from Teutonic Minnesota furnished the needful warmth.|$|E
60|$|She raised {{herself a}} trifle, and, looking round with a shiver, saw a {{half-moon}} sailing low above a dusky mass of trees. What {{seemed to be}} a wooden house stood in the midst of them, and its windows flung out streaks of ruddy light upon the snow. Behind it, she could dimly see a range of strange, shapeless buildings. They did not in the least look like English stables, barns, or granaries. Then there was a sound of voices, and a door swung open, letting out a broader track of brightness, in the midst of which the sleigh pulled up. Shadowy figures appeared here and there, and Leland, who unstrapped the robes, rolled them about her. Then, before she quite realised his purpose, he had lifted her and them together, and was walking stiffly towards the house. In another minute or two he set her down in a little log-walled room which had a <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> in the middle of it, and a hard-featured elderly woman came towards her with a kindly smile in her eyes.|$|E

50|$|Inside, {{the ground}} floor was {{designed}} to house kitchens and simpler living quarters. The first, main floor displays an unusually rich and well-preserved décor. In {{the centre of the}} floor is an octagonal dining room designed in a rather strict Neoclassical style: green and grey faux marble wall paintings with golden festoon-like decoration. Above the doors are painted reliefs depicting Mercury, Venus and Ceres. The <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> was made by the Marieberg <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> factory; Johan Liljencrantz was the main owner of the factory and seventeen of only approximately thirty known such stoves are located in Sturehov manor. The <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> in the so-called yellow antechamber, also on the first floor, is generally considered to be the most accomplished <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> in Sweden. In total, seven main rooms occupy the first floor, all richly embellished in a style ranging from late Rococo to Neoclassicism. The manor has also been furnished with furniture, art and objets d'art from the epoch, and it houses among other things sculptures by Tobias Sergel, a piano by John Broadwood and furniture by Georg Haupt.|$|E

50|$|Casa Malaparte was {{abandoned}} and neglected {{after the death}} of Curzio Malaparte in 1957. It suffered from vandalism and natural elements for many years and was seriously damaged, including the desecration of a <b>tiled</b> <b>stove,</b> before the first serious renovation started in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The building was donated to the Giorgio Ronchi Foundation in 1972.|$|E
50|$|The {{pavilion}} {{contains a}} set of interior of slightly later date, {{from the time of}} king Gustav III. It contains, among other things, a <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> which is probably the tallest in Sweden (4.65 m). The walls of the main room of the pavilion are decoratively painted with Ionic pilasters between which are decorative elements depicting medallions, vases, birds and antique figures. It also contains an unusually large chandelier.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is noteworthy for its very rich display of stucco decorations {{of high quality}} in late baroque-early neoclassicist style. Stucco decorations adorn all the main rooms of the manor. Additionally, there are fine baroque <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves</b> in the manor.|$|R
50|$|Imastu knight manor (Mönnikorb) {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in written records in 1447. The present-day building {{was built in}} the 1880s by master builder Friedrich Modi from Rakvere.

50|$|In 1870-74, a new {{manor house}} was built at the site by the {{landowner}} at the time, Otto Ludwig von Rennenkampff. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is built in a neo-Gothic style, with turrets and other details inspired by a romantic perception of the Middle Ages. The ceremonial rooms of the manor, on the first floor, have been restored. The interior also houses a wrought iron staircase and a noteworthy art nouveau <b>tiled</b> <b>stove.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} guarded by a {{specially}} appointed militia. Initially, the passage was free, but later fees were collected to cross it. On the Praga {{side of the}} bridge, from 1569 to 1572, a wooden mansion was built for King Sigismund Augustus. It was erected on a stone foundation and had 3 main rooms: a large heated dining hall, a chamber with a <b>tiled</b> <b>stove,</b> and a bedroom with an entrance to the basement. It {{was surrounded by a}} garden and a palisade and was used by the king to rest.|$|E
50|$|The centrepoint of {{the living}} area was a centrally-sited <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> or Kachelofen. It was also known in Alemannic as a Kunscht. Heated from the kitchen, it {{simultaneously}} warmed the parlour {{as well as the}} bedrooms above. The distribution of warm air to the floors above can be regulated by wooden slats. Often there was no chimney, rather the smoke was funnelled away by a flue, was used to smoke meat and then exited through the roof. That neutralised the dampness of the stalls and preserved the wood.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with his}} younger brother Carl Frederik Kähler, {{he took over the}} running of the factory in 1872. Carl became {{responsible}} for producing faiance while Herman specialized in manufacturing <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves.</b> In 1875, after Carl withdrew, Herman built a new factory on the town's outskirts where he produced both stoves and pottery.|$|R
50|$|The {{project had}} its {{beginnings}} in 1878 when Baron Alexander von Stieglitz (1814-84), a millionaire philanthropist, donated funds {{to build a}} museum {{for the benefit of}} students of the Central School of Engineering Design, which had been established by him earlier. The new museum was to accommodate Stieglitz's private collection of rare glassware, porcelains, tapestries, furniture, and <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves.</b>|$|R

50|$|Vatla manor {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the late 16th century. It became the property of Swedish noble family Bielke but was later {{taken over by the}} Swedish state through one of the so-called reductions. Later, it again came into the hands of different Baltic German aristocratic families. The current building dates from around 1810, and there are still some rather typical neoclassicist interior details preserved, such as a painted frieze and a <b>tiled</b> <b>stove.</b> Following the land reform that was enacted when Estonia gained its independence in 1919, the manor was transformed into a school.|$|E
50|$|On the north-west side of {{the street}} is the Tessin Palace, and on the {{opposite}} corner is the Royal Coin Cabinet. On the latter location was until 1903 a restaurant called Skomakare-Källaren, Café & Restaurant ("Shoemaker-Basement") {{known as one of the}} best eating houses in town and decorated with a coffered ceiling, pilasters, <b>tiled</b> <b>stove,</b> and the symbol of the shoemaker's guild, a silver shoe with a jingle on the toecap. The restaurant was preceded by another called Drufvan ("The Grape"), later renamed to Draken ("The Dragon"). The restaurant is today part of the museum of the Royal Coin Cabinet.|$|E
50|$|The {{next room}} is the Aldermans’ Hall, {{also known as}} the Court Room. It dates from 1299, and was used by members of the municipality. It has a special podium for the {{administration}} of justice. Beyond that lies the Council Chamber, dating from {{the first half of the}} 14th century. Here, important city decisions were made and you can find a Renaissance portal from 1528, probably painted by Andreas Walter. Until 1945, this room was richly decorated but some of the elements, such as wood paneling, furniture, and paintings, have been irretrievably lost. The wall paintings and baroque <b>tiled</b> <b>stove,</b> however, have survived.|$|E
50|$|Johann Michael Bossard {{was born}} in Zug/Switzerland in 1874. He was apprenticed as a builder of <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves</b> before {{studying}} art at Munich and Berlin. In 1907, he became professor for sculpture at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Hamburg (today the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg), a position he held {{until his retirement in}} 1944. Jutta Krull, 29 years his junior, was his student before they married in 1926.|$|R

50|$|During the {{ownership}} of Herman Wrangel, the castle started to change appearance; it was slowly transformed from a fortress into a residence. Wrangel had fireplaces and <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves</b> put in place, enlarged the windows and doors and added an extra floor to the building. The courtyard was also transformed into a household yard. The most visible legacy of his reconstruction scheme, however, is that he transformed the southern cannon tower into the present-day church, which is still standing.|$|R
5000|$|The Ern is {{the central}} area {{of the house and}} has a stove area (later a kitchen) at the back This {{developed}} from the ancient hearth near the main entrance or between the doors if the house had a [...] "crosspassage". On one side of the Flur there is a doorway to the living area and on the other to the working area. From the outset the house had two fireplaces. In the living room, the Stube, there was a <b>tiled</b> <b>stove,</b> and in the Flur was a stove for cooking, which was later partitioned off to form a kitchen.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 December 1920, {{the newly}} created toy museum was opened in the State Trade Training School (Staatliche Fachgewerbeschule). The {{collection}} of [...] "Older and Newer Playthings" [...] acquired since 1914 by its founder, Oberstudienrat Professor Alwin Seifert (1873-1937) was enhanced by the Härtel Collection. For the 1944 trade show a farmhouse parlour was put together, along with a <b>tiled</b> <b>stove</b> (Kachelofen) and a fireside bench. A candelabra that hung over the table (made by Louis Strauß and restored today) gave the parlour the usual Christmas time decoration. Neither were Christmas angels, miners, nutcrackers or Räuchermännel missing. The exhibition also included interesting old and new toys and demonstration lessons from the training school. At {{that time it was}} the only toy museum in Saxony.|$|E
50|$|The {{profile of}} the arc, that {{consists}} of two strong sharp-clear edge toruses, is repeated variably also in the two-vaulted parlour of the Town Hall that is behind the Citizens Hall. Low-relief keystones in the vaulted ceiling in the parlour of the Town Hall {{is one of the}} first examples of low embossing style that is representative to local late Gothic. The parlour of the Town Hall (raesaal) is the most important room of the Town Hall. The aldermen kept meetings and carried the votes there. One of the conveniences of the parlour was that it was heated. In the Middle Ages, not all the rooms had a fireplace or some other heating that could provide warmth in the winter, but the aldermen could not serve their duties in cold rooms. The <b>tiled</b> <b>stove,</b> standing in the corner, appeared several centuries later.Two money closets were immured in the walls of the parlour of the Town Hall. The closets' oak doors (oak is a very durable tree) have tinned iron hinges. These doors could have been locked, because the documents, money and the other valuable things were kept there. The town council held a town clerk in position, whose task was to mark important things in documents and who besides a beautiful handwriting, had a good education. The accounting room called kämmerei kemmerai can be named the Ministry of Finance. An account over all the town’s income and expenses was kept there. You could get into the treasury only through the kämmerei. Treasured pewter, silverware and other high-dimensional treasures, that did not fit in the closets of the parlour of the Town Hall, were stored there.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} still {{contains some}} very fine examples of original {{baroque and rococo}} interiors. These include two fine <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves</b> as well as stucco decorations, some of them possibly executed by master stucco craftsman Johann Michael Graff, who is famous for his extraordinary work at Rundāle Palace in Latvia. In the 19th century, further additions to the interior were made, such as the study with its richly carved and decorated wainscoting, neo-baroque stoves and stair balusters.|$|R
50|$|The manorial {{estate of}} Hatu (Hattoküll) dates from 1609, {{but the main}} {{building}} which can be seen today is much later, built only in 1864. It is constructed in an eclectic style and contains some original features in neo-Gothic and classical style, such as <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves</b> and doors. The property belonged to the Baltic German families of Mohrenschildt and Ramm. The last owner before the Estonian Declaration of Independence and the ensuing land reforms was Fridolf Gustav-Adolf von Ramm.|$|R
25|$|Leonardo da Vinci invented an {{automated}} {{system for a}} rotating spit for spit-roasting: a propeller in the chimney made the spit turn all by itself. This kind of system was widely used in wealthier homes. Beginning in the late Middle Ages, kitchens in Europe lost their home-heating function even more and were increasingly moved from the living area into a separate room. The living room was now heated by <b>tiled</b> <b>stoves,</b> operated from the kitchen, which offered the huge advantage of not filling the room with smoke.|$|R
