40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{duration}} of the floods on abiotic variables and attributes of species tolerant and intolerant to hypoxia (STH and SIH respectively) were evaluated in rivers and lakes of the upper Paraná River. Fish were sampled once a year, in six sampling stations, during the high water period from 2000 to 2003. There were overall reductions in dissolved oxygen levels and increases in transparency of water in lakes in years of moderate floods. The duration of floods influenced species differentially based on their tolerance to hypoxia: in moderate floods, richness <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> increased and numerical abundance and biomass of SIH reduced significantly. Opposite relationships were detected between dissolved oxygen and the attributes <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> and SIH. Dissolved oxygen was the best predictor <b>of</b> variability <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> and SIH in years of moderate floods, whereas water transparency predicted significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> in years <b>of</b> short floods. Being positively affected by dissolved oxygen reductions, <b>STH</b> seem to <b>take</b> advantages in persisting in seasonally harsh lentic habitats. The incorporation of abiotic data as well the differential tolerance of species to hypoxia would improve further investigations of the effects of interannual variations in the flood pulse on tropical fish assemblage...|$|R

Analysis of the modified nucleosides and 5 '-terminal cap structures in radiolabeled mRNA by high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated that internal N 6 -methylation of adenosine was reduced by 65 % at 50 microM STH and by 83 % at 500 microM STH.

Of these patients, 7 were male and 13 were female. The average age was 46. 5, ranging from 24 to 66 years old. Dosage <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> varied between 10 mg and 40 mg/day in each {{patient and the}} mean administration period was 14 months.

40|$|Background. Soil Transmitted Helminth (STH) {{infections are}} a major public health problem that affects more than two billion people around the world.

To assess {{the correlation between the}} presence <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> infections and nutritional status among elementary school children in Medan, Indonesia. Material and methods. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study involving students from the public elementary school 060925 Medan in September 2015. The study participants were chosen by the total sampling technique and according to predetermined inclusion criteria (80 students from third and fourth grades). Univariate analysis was performed to determine STH infection prevalence, and bivariate analysis was used to find the correlation between STH infections and eosinophil levels through the chi-square (χ 2) test. Results. We found that the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> among study subjects was 40 %, and 26 students (32. 5 %) were underweight. The most common types of worm infections were Ascaris lumbricoides (25. 0 %), Trichuris trichiura (11. 2 %) and mixed infections (3. 8 %). A significant correlation was found between the presence <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> infection and underweight nutritional status (C = 0. 24; χ 2 = 5. 02; p = 0. 025) and the risk <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> infection and nutritional status in children with a prevalence ratio (PR) of 2. 05 (CI 95 %: 1. 08 – 3. 87).

40|$|Abstract. Infectious {{diseases}} {{caused by}} soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are important diseases of humans, which affect {{about one third}} of the world’s population. Examination of soil can be used to estimate the risk <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> infection in humans. We carried out this survey to clarify the current status of soil contamination by parasite eggs and to assess the risk <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> infection. During survey periods, we examined soil, faeces, and the lifestyle of residents. Six genera and eight species of parasite eggs including Ascaris lumbricoides, Toxocara cati, Toxocara canis, and Trichuris trichiura were recovered from 85 out of 120 soil samples (71 %). Contamination of soil by parasite eggs had spread widely throughout the village, and 50 % of eggs recovered had already developed into fertilized eggs. It is remarkable that Ascaris eggs were recovered from inside the houses. Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> in school children was 63 %. This may indicate that school or preschool children cause soil contamination. Some of the eggs recovered were not only from humans but also from dogs and cats. From the results obtained, the need for health education with regards to zoonoses was revealed because 77 % of fertilized Toxocara spp. eggs were detected. We conclude that the risk <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> infection in residents was extremely high, because the soil in this village was highly contaminated by infective parasite eggs...|$|R

MAb SH 1, which recognized Asn at position 4 and Tyr at position 5 from the N terminus was 100 times more potent in neutralizing the bioactivity <b>of</b> <b>STh</b> in the suckling mouse assay than was MAb 11 C, which recognized Thr at position 16 and Tyr at position 19 from the N terminus <b>of</b> the <b>STh</b> molecule. The MAbs which recognized Leu at position 9 from the N terminus (MAb 53 - 4) and Tyr at position 19 from the N terminus (MAb 8 G 7) showed intermediate activities in the neutralization assay. The guanylate cyclase-inhibiting activities of SH 1 and 11 C essentially paralleled {{the results for the}} neutralization of bioactivity, while MAbs 53 - 4 and 8 G 7 exhibited reverse activity. These results indicate that MAbs that recognize the N-terminal residues which have been shown not to be essential for toxic activity have a potent protective capacity. None of the MAbs reacted with reduced and carboxy-methylated native STh. This suggests that all of the MAbs mediate their effect by reacting with conformation-dependent antigenic determinants...|$|R
40|$|Data on soil-transmitted {{helminth}} (STH) {{infections and}} reinfection among Orang Ash (aborigine) schoolchildren and their nutritional {{and socioeconomic status}} were analyzed to investigate the pattern and the possible predictors <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> reinfection. In this longitudinal study, 120 (60 males and 60 females) Orang Ash primary schoolchildren aged 7 - 12 years and living in remote areas in Pos Betau, Kuala Lipis, Pahang were screened for the presence <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> using modified cellophane thick smear and Harada Mori techniques. The overall prevalence of ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infections were 65. 8, 97. 5 and 10. 8, respectively. After complete deworming with a 3 -day course of 400 mg/daily of albendazole tablets, children were re-examined at 3 and 6 months from baseline. The reinfection rate, {{by one or more}} <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> species, at 3 months after deworming was high (49. 5) while 79. 6 of the children were reinfected at 6 months after deworming. Logistic regression analyses showed that females, stunted children and those living in houses without toilets had significantly higher reinfection rates than others at 3 months (P < 0. 05). At 6 months, maternal employment status emerged as another predictor where children of working mothers had significantly higher reinfection rates (P = 0. 026). In conclusion, reinfection rate <b>of</b> <b>STH</b> is high and thus necessitates frequent and periodic deworming among children. Public health personnel need to re-look at the current control measures and identify innovative and integrated ways in order to reduce STH significantly in the rural communities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.
