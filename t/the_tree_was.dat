5|$|Potter's idea to {{make the}} {{squirrel}} grow so fat he cannot escape <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> imitated by A. A. Milne in Winnie the Pooh.|$|E
5|$|Following the fire, experts {{recommended}} that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a security measure. According to the Division of Forestry, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> finally brought down {{during the summer of}} 2010.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> again {{attacked}} (along with Pi Jove) with a 10cm chainsaw {{cut into}} one of the other trunks. This damage was quickly patched up with steel straps as before.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} of a birds nest in a <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> bird <b>is</b> benefitting because <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> giving <b>the</b> bird shelter and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> not getting {{anything}} in return.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} sacred by Hindus as God Vishnu {{is believed}} to dwell in it. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> worshiped on Amalaka Ekadashi.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{variously}} rich in tannins {{that are}} of some antimicrobial interest. Some parts of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> used in regional traditional medicine.|$|R
5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} land around <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} {{acquired by the}} Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was too costly to undertake. The Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust also leased out the land where <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.|$|E
5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> felled on September 23 {{during a}} {{ceremony}} attended by between 2,500 and 3,000 people. Among those in attendance were state forester D.B. Griffin, {{the president of}} the Island Creek Coal Company, E.P. Rice, and representatives from other companies that had previously owned and leased the land where <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> located. In addition to standard cameras photographing the event, two movie cameras were brought to capture the felling and its associated events. Uniformed West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission officers, Mingo County sheriffs' deputies, and other law enforcement personnel were also on hand to provide security and direct traffic.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> a {{vigorous}} grower with a large, dense canopy. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> moderately resistant to anthracnose {{and is a}} consistent but poor bearer.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{not known}} (2016) {{to be in}} {{cultivation}} beyond the Netherlands. It <b>is</b> claimed <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> able to 'grow easily in all soils'.|$|R
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} used for {{ornamental}} decoration during festivals. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> a main attraction in gardens throughout India. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> can <b>be</b> cut into various shapes and maintained in required sizes. In past, the flexible, straight and light-weight trunks {{were used in the}} making of masts for sailing ships. That <b>is</b> why <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> also known as <b>the</b> Mast <b>Tree.</b> Today, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> mostly used for manufacturing small articles such as pencils, boxes, matchsticks, etc.|$|R
5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> permanently weakened.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 700-year-old oak tree, {{called the}} Domesday Oak, was {{selected}} by The Tree Council as one of 50 Great British Trees. In 2011 a crack appeared in the trunk and oak support beams were fitted to support the tree. The supports were only partly successful and {{a section of the}} tree collapsed; the remaining part of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> pruned to reduce the weight of the surviving section.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> an acacia, {{lying on}} a small mound on a promontory. Despite its small size, due to its remoteness, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} landmark.|$|R
50|$|Parts of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} dyestuff; <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> used for fodder; the foliage and seed pods make good forage for {{livestock}} and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> stands up well to this use.|$|R
50|$|No {{specific}} aging {{statistics for}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> available, however, {{based on its}} size, numerous forestry sources, including the county's historical marker for <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> estimate that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> at least 2,000 years old.|$|R
5|$|In about 1797 a {{schoolmaster}} {{living in}} the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John Stair) was the original cultivator, but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> unveiled {{on the wall of}} the village school.|$|E
5|$|Known to Māori as tī kōuka, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> used as {{a source}} of food, {{particularly}} in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, and sandals. Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi Island, where it was among the first seedling trees to be planted.|$|E
5|$|Red maple's rapid growth, ease of transplanting, {{attractive}} form, {{and value}} for wildlife (in the eastern US) {{has made it}} one of the most extensively planted trees. In parts of the Pacific Northwest, it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and gardens, as well as occasionally in churchyards.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> in {{a second}} growth forest and is much taller than <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} <b>trees.</b> <b>The</b> original old-growth forest was first logged in the 1893, yet this individual <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> spared. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> very large at the base as it flares out above ground into the root system. Many of its branches are covered in moss. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by a fence to protect its root system from excessive trampling.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the name}} of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> not {{provided}} in the poem and other trees exist in Norse mythology, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> near universally accepted as <b>the</b> cosmic <b>tree</b> Yggdrasil, and if <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> Yggdrasil, then <b>the</b> name Yggdrasil (Old Norse 'Ygg's steed') directly relates to this story. Odin is associated with hanging and gallows; John Lindow comments that [...] "the hanged 'ride' the gallows".|$|R
5000|$|Row of Street <b>Trees</b> <b>is</b> a heritage-listed {{avenue of}} trees at Macrossan Street, Halifax, Shire of Hinchinbrook, Queensland, Australia. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planted [...] <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> added to <b>the</b> Queensland Heritage Register on 6 September 2003.|$|R
5|$|Six {{victims of}} the {{shooting}} were carried to {{the porch of the}} Brewer house, which was shaded by a tall oak tree. The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak. It blew down in a storm in the early 1990s. A piece of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> saved as a memorial and is on display at nearby Pioneer Elementary School in Hanford.|$|E
5|$|The age of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} by carbon dating of genetically matched plant material collected {{from under the}} tree, as dendrochronology would cause damage. The trunk itself {{is estimated to be}} only a few hundred years old, but the plant has survived for much longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when the trunk dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout a new trunk).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{introductions of}} A. altissima to countries outside of its native range {{were to the}} southern areas of Korea {{as well as to}} Japan. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> a very early introduction. Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.|$|E
50|$|Heli-Logging is {{also known}} as {{standing}} stem harvesting which is based on individual <b>tree</b> selection (ITS). <b>The</b> selection process is done by engineers and surveyors. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> selected based on demand for specific types and grades. Before the selection process <b>is</b> complete <b>the</b> selected <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> bored to check their reliability. <b>The</b> selected <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> then marked and their diameters are recorded. The diameter of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> measured at 1.3 meters above the ground. The sizes of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> that <b>are</b> selected are controlled by two things. The minimum size is controlled by the economy while the maximum size is controlled by the capacity of the helicopter. Once <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> selected they are climbed, the limbs <b>are</b> removed and <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> topped. <b>The</b> length of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and <b>the</b> diameter at its top are then recorded. All the recorded data is then entered into a database which calculates volumes, weights, etc. <b>The</b> selected <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> then partially cut at the stem and supported by wooden wedges. The stem is then grappled by the helicopter and pulled until the wood breaks at the partial cut. <b>The</b> logged <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> then brought by helicopter to a predetermined roadside location or dropped into open water where they are collected.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{grows to}} {{a height of}} < 10 m, its crown of short, twiggy {{branches}} bearing dense green foliage, turning golden yellow in autumn. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> relatively free of mildew.|$|R
5000|$|Basking Ridge {{is home to}} a 600-year-old White Oak, {{perhaps the}} oldest White Oak in the world. [...] <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> located on <b>the</b> {{historic}} graveyard of the local Presbyterian church. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> [...] high and has a trunk circumference of [...] and its lower branches are supported. In 2016 <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> showed signs of distress as its upper parts failed to sprout leaves. A big portion of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> set to be cut down due to decay in 2017. [...] <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> has since <b>been</b> cut down as of April 26th, 2017.|$|R
5|$|The oak tree, {{under which}} Andy leaves a note for Red {{directing}} him to Zihuatanejo, {{became a symbol}} of hope for its role in the film. It was split by lightning on July 29, 2011; officials were unsure if the tree would survive. However, after urging by a group raising money to protect the tree, government arborists inspected the tree which was found to be alive and well. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Tree That Owns Itself {{is estimated}} to have started life at some time between the mid-16th and late 18th centuries. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> considered {{by some to be}} both the biggest tree in Athens and the most famous tree in the United States. The tree predated the transformation of the area into a residential neighborhood beginning in the mid-19th century. The residence adjacent to the tree, known as Dominie House, was built at the corner of Milledge Avenue and Waddell Street in 1883, and was moved to its present location about twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1938, the Mingo Oak failed to produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state {{forester}} D.B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing {{theory is that the}} tree died from the release of poisonous gases and sulfur fumes from a burning spoil tip in nearby Trace Gap. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections being sent to the Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.|$|E
5000|$|In India, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> goes by {{a variety}} of names, many {{deriving}} from the Sanskrit kētakī (...) [...] [...] In Arabic speaking countries, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> referred to as al-kādi (...) [...] [...] In Japan, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> called adan (...) and grows on Okinawa.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{cultivated}} for ornamental purposes. The {{fruits of}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> edible and are eaten by Indigenous Australians, {{though it is}} very bitter-tasting. They are also eaten by flying foxes and birds (like Cassowaries).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Ashoka <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> often planted near temples. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} {{a symbol}} of love and is {{dedicated}} to Kamadeva.|$|R
