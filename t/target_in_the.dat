5|$|As group runners-up, Juventus {{had to face}} a group winner – Germans Borussia Dortmund of Group D – in {{the last}} 16. They won 2–1 {{at home in the}} first leg on 24 February 2015, with all the goals in the first half – visitor Marco Reus {{equalised}} either side of strikes from Tevez and Álvaro Morata. The same forwards were on <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second leg at the Westfalenstadion on 18 March – Tevez scored twice, including in the third minute – as Juventus won 3–0, and 5–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Ashford's {{importance}} as a transport hub and its location between {{the continent and}} London made it a target for aerial bombing. A bomb fell on the railway works on 25 March 1917, killing 61 people, while the town was a <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Britain during World War II, including an attack on 15 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in November 1918, the Regia Marina demobilized; {{severely}} reduced naval budgetsthe {{result of}} a weakened Italian economy in the early 1920sled to further draw-downs. Marsalas engines were plagued with problems throughout her career, which made the ship an obvious <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effort to trim the Regia Marinas budget. She was stricken from the naval register on 27 November 1927 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|On 9 February, two {{divisions}} of the Japanese Twenty Fifth Army, led by Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita, landed on the northwestern coast of Singapore, in the Sarimbun area. Yamashita's headquarters (HQ) was in the Sultan of Johor's palace on Istana Bukit Serene, which offered him and his officers a bird's eye view of virtually every key <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern sector of Singapore Island, only 1.6 kilometres (one mile) across the Straits of Johor. Sultan Ibrahim's palace was not fired upon by the British because any damage caused would have extensive repercussions for British-Johor ties.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes into}} the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he pushed past Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms. However, due to the difficult shooting angle, Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh Wicks parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the <b>target.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 18th minute, Seattle midfielder Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate Freddie Ljungberg, whose shot on goal was barely saved by Wicks, who kicked out a foot to block the shot. Just before halftime, Le Toux crossed to an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of Wicks, who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0. Seattle outshot D.C. 9–6 in the first half.|$|E

5|$|In 1830 {{a series}} of {{revolutions}} struck Europe: the July Revolution in France, the Belgian Revolution and smaller revolts in Italy threatened to overthrow the framework of European politics established at the Congress of Vienna. As the Russian tsars were among the strongest advocates of that status quo, the uprising in Poland and the ousting of the tsar as the king of Poland by the Sejm and Senate of Poland on 25 January 1831 were considered a serious irritant. Russia could not send its armies to Belgium or France before the rebellion in Poland was quelled. For that reason the capture of Warsaw was Russia's main <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war {{from the start of}} hostilities.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 Syngenta bought Belgian RNAi firm Devgen for $522 {{million and}} Monsanto paid $29.2 {{million for the}} {{exclusive}} rights to intellectual property from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. The International Potato Center in Lima, Peru is looking for genes to <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sweet potato weevil, a beetle whose larvae ravage sweet potatoes globally.

Monsanto will likely be first to market, with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the western corn rootworm, a beetle whose larvae annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone. A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts larval growth, killing them within days. In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his <b>target,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blind spot of the observer, and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.|$|E
50|$|As part of SIOP planning, Strategic Air Command (SAC, later USSTRATCOM) {{developed}} {{a set of}} plans {{and a series of}} options based on a target set known as the National Target Base (NTB). <b>The</b> number of <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NTB varied over time, from 16,000 in 1985 to 12,500 at the end of <b>the</b> Cold War <b>in</b> 1991, to 2,500 by 2001. The SIOP was primarily directed against <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union (later Russia) but <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> People's Republic of China, which {{had been part of the}} SIOP until the 1970s, were added back into <b>the</b> plan <b>in</b> 1997. <b>In</b> 1999, <b>the</b> NTB reportedly included <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya.|$|R

5|$|Klose's goal {{initiated}} {{a flurry of}} German scoring as Brazil {{lost control of the}} game. In the 24th minute, Kroos scored with a left-footed strike {{from the edge of the}} area after Lahm's cross was deflected. Then, in the 26th minute, just a few seconds after Brazil kicked off, Kroos caught Fernandinho in possession in his own half and played a one-two with Khedira before scoring again. Kroos' goals came just 70 seconds apart. Khedira himself scored in the 29th minute after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil. All five of Germany's first half goals came within the first half-hour, with four of them coming in one six-minute period. Brazil had no shots on <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half. Many Brazil supporters in the crowd were visibly in shock or reduced to tears. The resulting fights in the Mineirão stands forced the Military Police to send a special forces squad into the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Repairs were {{completed}} by March 1941, Lützow returned to Norway {{to join the}} forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She ran aground during a planned attack on convoy PQ 17, which necessitated another return to Germany for repairs. She next saw action at the Battle of the Barents Sea with the heavy cruiser , which ended with a failure to destroy the convoy JW 51B. Engine problems forced a series of repairs culminating in a complete overhaul {{at the end of}} 1943, after which the ship remained in the Baltic. Sunk in shallow waters in the Kaiserfahrt in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, Lützow was used as a gun battery to support German troops fighting the Soviet Army until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Tallon was scrutinised as a Test {{candidate}} when England toured for the 193637 Ashes series. He {{was selected}} in Bradman's XI for a one-off match against Victor Richardson's XI {{at the start}} of the season. It was a testimonial for Richardson and such matches were used as Test trials for the top players in Australia. Tallon took three catches but was unable to capitalise with the bat. He made three and was unbeaten without scoring in the second innings as Bradman's men reached their <b>target.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next match against New South Wales, Tallon took four catches and scored 100 to bring his team back into contention after conceding a 190-run lead. However, New South Wales scraped home to win by one wicket. It continued a winless streak for Tallon in Queensland colours that had lasted for over two and a half years. Tallon had a final chance to push for selection in two matches for an Australian XI and Queensland respectively, against Gubby Allen's Englishmen before the Tests. He made a total of seven dismissals but scored only 49 runs in three innings.|$|E

5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, {{who was in}} the penalty area, but was tackled and match play continued, which saw Arsenal attack on the counter under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off <b>target.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United brought Giggs on at {{the start}} of extra time, the Welshman taking Fletcher's place in the midfield. They {{immediately}} tried to play him in down the left wing, but the pass was over-hit and went beyond Giggs. Arsenal finally got their first shot on <b>target</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventh minute of extra time, when a Van Persie free kick – awarded for a foul by Silvestre – forced a diving save from Carroll. Four minutes later, Manchester United appealed for a penalty kick when a cross from Giggs struck Cole, but replays showed that the ball hit the Arsenal full-back in the midriff. United sustained their attack, and the ball came to Scholes in the penalty area, but his shot on the turn was well saved by Lehmann. The resultant corner was taken short by Scholes, before it was played back to him; his cross found Van Nistelrooy unmarked in the area, but the Dutchman headed over the bar {{from the edge of the}} goal area. United then had another penalty shout when Giggs volleyed a long ball from Scholes into Touré's body and up onto the Ivorian's hand, but referee Rob Styles turned their claims down. Arsenal then brought on Edu to replace Pirès for the remaining 15 minutes.|$|E
