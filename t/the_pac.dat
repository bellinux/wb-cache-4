5|$|The City furthered {{its plan}} of {{renewing}} {{the area and}} took no heed of <b>the</b> <b>PAC.</b> In response, <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> secretly submitted an application to the National Register of Historic Places for the Milwaukee Avenue district. It was approved on May 2, 1974 by Secretary of the Interior Rogers CB Morton. This meant that the City could not alter or destroy the houses using federal funds without a public hearing.|$|E
5|$|The phase-amplitude {{converter}} {{creates the}} sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word {{received from the}} PA. <b>The</b> <b>PAC</b> can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed {{to reduce the amount}} of memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> look-up table. If <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> output (amplitude) word.|$|E
50|$|To {{facilitate}} the application for and acquisition of Ghanaian passports, Passport Application Centers (PACs) {{have been set}} up around the country of Ghana. <b>The</b> <b>PACs</b> in Accra accept applications; <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> in Kumasi accept applications; <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> in Tamale accept applications; <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> in Ho accept applications; <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> in Sekondi-Takoradi accept applications; and <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> in Sunyani accept applications.|$|R
50|$|The Post also {{reported}} that Chavez and her family, through political action committees they had created, including the Republican Issues Committee, the Latino Alliance, Stop Union Political Abuse, and the Pro-Life Campaign Committee, had further family income. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> paid Chavez's husband $77,000, her son Pablo $25,000, and her son David about $10,000. Then, from 2002 through 2006, <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> paid Chavez and her family $261,000. <b>The</b> <b>PACs</b> raised $24.5 million from January 2003 to December 2006, {{with a total of}} $242,000 of that money being given to politicians.|$|R

5|$|In December 2005, Michael Schiavo {{created a}} {{political}} action committee, TerriPAC. It {{was formed to}} raise money to support right-to-die candidates and oppose candidates who had voted for government involvement in the Schiavo case. In 2007, TerriPAC paid a $1,350 fine to the Federal Election Commission for failing to file complete and timely records. Schiavo shut down <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> later that year.|$|E
5|$|Biko {{endorsed}} {{the unification of}} South Africa's black liberationist groups—among them the BCM, PAC, and African National Congress (ANC)—in order to concentrate their anti-apartheid efforts. To this end, {{he reached out to}} leading members of the ANC, PAC, and Unity Movement. His communications with the ANC were largely via Griffiths Mxenge, and plans were being made to smuggle him out of the country to meet Oliver Tambo, a leading ANC figure. Biko's negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> were primarily through intermediaries who exchanged messages between him and Sobukwe; those with the Unity Movement were largely via Fikile Bam.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, as World War I began, {{he joined}} the Service Aéronautique of the French Army as a volunteer, being {{assigned}} to the Escadrille les Cigognes as a French and Peruvian officer. He flew numerous reconnaissance flights over Belgium until he was wounded. Bielovucic was awarded the Legion of Honour, {{as well as the}} Croix de guerre with a bronze palm and a number of Belgian and Peruvian medals. Later on he worked as the head of an engine testing team in Bellanger and then as the principal of an aviation school in Reims. Bielovucic retired from active piloting in 1920, and returned to Peru where he became lieutenant commander of <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> Reserve, regarded as a national hero.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|While the BPC was {{primarily}} political, Black Consciousness activists also established the Black Community Programmes (BCPs) {{to focus on}} improving healthcare and education and fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by a program on Christian action, established by the Christian Institute of Southern Africa and the South African Council of Churches. Additional funds came from the Anglo-American Corporation, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and Bokwe Mafuna, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited Kimberley, where he met <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> founder and anti-apartheid activist Robert Sobukwe.|$|E

5|$|Juan Bielovucic (30 July 1889 – 14 January 1949) was a Peruvian aviator of Croatian and French descent who set several {{speed and}} {{altitude}} aviation records in 1910–13. He {{was also the}} first person to complete a successful powered aircraft crossing of the Alps in 1913, following a 1910 attempt by Jorge Chávez that ended in a fatal crash landing. He established the first aviation school in South America in Lima, Peru. Bielovucic became a colonel of the Peruvian Aviation Corps (PAC) in 1911, joined the Service Aéronautique of the French Army as a volunteer in 1914 and earned the Legion of Honour for his service in World War I. He retired from active aviation in 1920 and returned to Peru where he became the lieutenant commander of <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> Reserve. He was also active with the French Resistance during World War II. In Croatia, he is regarded as the first Croatian aviator.|$|E

25|$|Magnates of the Commonwealth {{are often}} called the {{aristocracy}} of the Commonwealth but the definition of what constitutes aristocracy differs {{from the rest of}} Europe in that the Magnate families were much more powerful, often comparable to Princes. A good example is the extinct family of Pac that ruled the Duchy of Lithuania in the 17th century. <b>The</b> <b>Pac</b> family had not descended from a Prince, and therefore did not use any title at all. During the partition of the Commonwealth <b>the</b> <b>Pac</b> family received the title of Count. However, when looking at the size of <b>the</b> <b>Pac</b> properties and their position in the Commonwealth, a simple Count title seems not adequate to their power and property size that was far beyond imagination of most of the European Lords.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 VanderSloot funded two PACs that {{launched}} last-minute ads against Idaho 2nd District Judge John Bradbury, a Democrat, during his electoral run for state Supreme Court against Republican incumbent Justice Roger Burdick. VanderSloot donated $19,000 to <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> Idaho Citizens for Justice and financed <b>the</b> <b>PAC</b> Citizens for Commonsense Solutions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the synthesis of activated carbon derived from cattle manure compost (CMC) causing environmental problems using zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) activation and to examine the suitability and performance of the prepared activated carbon (PAC) in removing 2 -methylisoborneol (2 -MIB) from aqueous solution. The influence of ZnCl 2 /CMC ratios and outgassing from <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> on <b>the</b> removal of 2 -MIB were studied. Pore texture and surface functional groups were obtained to characterize <b>the</b> <b>PACs.</b> It is suggested that the increase of micropore surface area and volume {{as a result of the}} activation favored the removal of 2 -MIB while activated carbon rich in acidic functional groups showed poor 2 -MIB adsorption. The preferable removal of 2 -MIB depended on the poor acidic functional groups and the higher micropore surface area in <b>the</b> <b>PACs.</b> A sample of <b>the</b> <b>PACs</b> was synthesized at a lower temperature (around 550 WC) compared to commercially available activated carbon (CAAC) (around 900 °C). The sample showed a performance for 2 -MIB removal for drinking water purification as well as CAAC.
