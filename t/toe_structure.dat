The existing knowledge on toe stability and the influence of all governing parameters in the existing knowledge is reviewed. The tests which were performed for the present research are treated extensively. The main governing parameters, which determine toe stability in rubble mound breakwaters, are: Significant wave height : Hs Nominal stone diameter : Dn 50 Stone mass density : ρ s Depth above the toe : ht Damage level : Nod Parameters investigated which appeared to have no significant influence are: the fictitious wave steepness sop and the width of the <b>toe</b> <b>structure</b> bt. The choice of the governing parameters, the definition of damage levels for the design of the <b>toe</b> <b>structure</b> and the way they are made dimensionless are motivated. The results from the present tests are compared with existing design formula. With the selected parameters two formulas have been derived from the available test data. One describes toe stability using the shallow water significant wave height Hs the other uses the shallow water 2 % wave height H 2 %. The formulas are compared with existing test results and their range of application is given. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|This Master Thesis {{contains}} {{a study on}} the stability of the <b>toe</b> <b>structure</b> of rubble-mound breakwaters based on small scale model tests performed in the large wave flume of the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Faculty of Civil Engineering of Delft University of Technology. In this report the study of Gerding (1993) on the stability of toe structures was continued. This has been done according to the design relation suggested by Gerding. In his tests the density of the stone was not varied, although it is a parameter in the formula. The main purpose of the study at hand was to check the validity of the density in the Gerding-relation: therefore the stone mass density ?s in this research was varied: namely 1900, 2550 and 2850 kg/m 3, respectively the materials brick, porphyry and basalt. Only one cross section of a rubble mound breakwater with various toe structures was investigated. The existing knowledge and the influence of all governing parameters is reviewed. The main variables were toe height, Zt, water depth in front of the toe hm, water depth above the toe, ht, wave height, Hs, nominal stone diameters, Dn 50 and stone mass density ?s. Variation of the wave steepness wasnt of influence on the toe stability, because the range of values of the surf similarity parameter was such that the reflection coefficient was almost constant. Existing knowledge is presented from which an analysis of the influence of the parameters involved followed. The tests are described and then the result of the measurements is analyzed. The data showed too much scatter and therefore elaborated to one damage level Nod= 0. 5 (start of damage). The influence of the relative density of the stone, Δ, was reproduced in the Gerding-relation in the right way, because different stone mass densities gave similar results for Hs/ΔDn 50 as a function of ht/Dn 50. The design curve by Gerding be used for the design of toe structures, albeit that the designer must not forget the influence of hm which is not mentioned in this relation. In the present study the same trend is found but the values from the present study show a higher stability of the structure than with the suggested relation of Gerding, which is more conservative. Computations of toe stability were performed according to Shields and to Rance & Warren to get an analysis on analytical grounds, because empirically found results dont necessarily have to be right. Only the computations according to Rance & Warren could fit the results of the measurements with addition of a small amplification factor. The parameter of the local water depth in front of the <b>toe</b> <b>structure,</b> hm, had still an influence on the relation found between Hs/ΔDn 50 and ht/Dn 50; this followed both from the tests and the computations. So it is risky to use the design curve for all hm. The working-out of the computations must be improved and more experiments are needed to enlarge the knowledge of the influence of hm and to simulate the measurements more accurate. Differences have been found between this study and the research of Gerding. The damage estimated was on the average two times smaller than the damage Gerding had determined. The reason why this happened is still unknown. It is therefore recommended to perform further research to explain why this difference occurs. More insight into toe stability may be found when the velocity distribution over the water depth in front of the <b>toe</b> <b>structure</b> is better defined and when the influence of the shape of the foreshore and of the reflection on the structure on toe stability would be taken into account.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{stability}} of toe material for rubble mound breakwaters in depth limited conditions. The present equation, Van der Meer 1998, gives results for depth limited conditions but is not validated. The empirical equation is based on physical model tests done by Gerding 1993. The Van der Meer equation implies deep water and breaking waves on the structure slope. For shallow water conditions this assumption is not valid. Waves start breaking at the fore shore slope and toe which results in a different hydrodynamical wave load at the toe. Toe material is exposed to waves and starts behaving as armour rock. The uncertainties, introduced by shallow water situation are investigated in this research. The objective for this thesis is finding a more reliable design equation in this situation. Fore shore slope and wave steepness are considered of influence. The research is done by performing scale model tests in a two dimensional wave flume. The observations from the experiments and {{the analysis of the}} performed dataset gave following conclusions: Fore shore slope is strongly influencing toe stability. This is not only valid in shallow water but also in deep water. In shallow water, wave steepness influences toe stability as well. This is not proven for deep water. Very shallow water shows different hydrodynamic behaviour. Wave breaking occurs at the fore shore. The <b>toe</b> <b>structure</b> is attacked by breaking or already broken waves. Although a reduced wave height reaches the toe, damage is larger because the toe is exposed to turbulent wave attack. A new design equation for very shallow water is suggested in which fore shore slope and wave steepness are included. This is an empirical relation, using dimensionless relations like the Hudson stability number and a new damage number in percentages. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Seaports {{are often}} {{protected}} against waves and currents by rubble mound breakwaters. At {{the interface between}} outer breakwater slope and seabed a <b>toe</b> <b>structure</b> is often build, which provides stability to the outer slope. The toe consists of a relatively small heap of rock. Since 1977 dedicated studies are made to the stability of these rock elements under wave attack. A large number of stability methods is available, but prediction accuracy is low and validity ranges are too small for use in practice. Clarity on applicability of these methods is desired by designers. In Baart (2008) a new approach towards toe stability is defended. The ‘decoupled model approach’ determines stability with a two-step model. In the first step local hydraulic conditions right above the toe bed are calculated. The second step uses these conditions in a general formula for stone motion to predict motion. In this thesis the decoupled model approach is implemented and tested {{by means of the}} computational fluid dynamics model IH- 2 VOF. Prediction capacity of existing toe stability methods is reviewed against numerical results. The approach predicts motion rather than an amount of damage. To achieve this, critical values for stability and damage were imposed where necessary. The IH- 2 VOF model was reviewed first. Convergence tests gave recommendations for the computational grid layout. During testing it was found that position of the partially standing wave, produced by breakwater reflection under regular waves, is of major importance when reviewing different tests. It was discovered also that turbulence modelling in IH- 2 VOF did not function properly. The Nammuni-Krohn (2009) cases were modelled and numerical results were compared with physical measurements by Nammuni-Krohn. Little correspondence was found, likely caused by differences between numerical and physical model. High sensitivity to stone properties (diameter, porosity and Forchheimer coefficients) was encountered. Analytical solutions for flow velocity either over- or underestimated the numerical results. Work by Peters (2014 a) increased confidence in the utility of IH- 2 VOF for breakwater modelling. Under the assumption that turbulence is not of large importance, the Ebbens (2009) cases were modelled. By literature study the formulae by Izbash (1930), Rance and Warren (1968), Dessens (2004), Steenstra (2014) and Peters (2014 b) were selected to predict stone motion. Calibration of these formulae was necessary; Rance and Warren (1968) and Peters (2014 b) produced most reliable results. They probably do not need any calibration, making them more universally applicable. Prediction of motion by toe stability methods and decoupled model approach were compared. The formulae by Van der Meer (1991), Gerding (1993) and Van der Meer (1998) give good agreement when validity limits are respected. If neglected, prediction capacity did not decrease much. Van Gent and Van der Werf (2014) and Muttray et al. (2014) then perform good as well. Low sensitivity to the critical values for stability and damage was found. The decoupled model approach is considered to be appropriate to determine toe stability. The results in this study should on the other hand not be used for design purposes as long as some fundamental problems are not solved. The incorrect turbulence calculation, high sensitivity to stone properties and velocity measurement difficulties of the motion formulae are the main issues which should be investigated in further research.

40|$|Deterministic design {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used to determine preliminary breakwater designs. Partial safety factors take into account previous experiences and provide a robust preliminary design. However, local circumstances can prove to differ considerably compared to average design conditions and stochastic variations in breakwater strength parameters are commonly neglected. With new armouring techniques, such as Core-loc armouring, the uncertainties about the armour strength are relatively large. Design guidelines include a safety factor, but often an additional safety margin is applied in the final design of the armouring to ensure stability. This can result in structure strengths more, or less, than locally required. The economic optimum geometry with the lowest costs is possibly not achieved. These costs consist of the initial construction cost, the collapse damage cost and the economic damage cost due to downtime. To include the damage cost or risk (= failure probability x economic consequence) of breakwater collapse and functional failure, a probabilistic approach {{can be used to}} determine the failure probabilities. In Veracruz, Mexico, the port authority of the Port of Veracruz investigates the feasibility of a large port extension next to the existing port of Veracruz. In the preliminary layout a Core-loc armoured breakwater is anticipated to provide shelter at a container terminal and quay location. Deterministic design methods result in an element weight of 18. 7 t (8. 5 m 3). Two construction methods are evaluated: a water-based and a land-based construction method, with crest heights of 3 m +SWL and 11 m +SWL respectively. In this deterministic evaluation the economic consequences of functional failure are not taken into account, but both alternatives fulfilled the harbour tranquillity restrictions by the port authority: a maximum downtime of 5 %. The water-based construction method is elected as the best construction method, due to lower construction costs of 110. 7 $ million. The deterministic breakwater design is optimised with a probabilistic method for the most important parameters: the weight of the Core-loc elements and the breakwater crest height. And a progressive deterioration over time of the strength of the Core-loc armour is taken into account. The probabilities of collapse and functional failure of the breakwater and the economic consequences of failure are determined for 56 combinations of element weight and crest height. The probability of collapse is composed of two failure mechanisms: the Core-loc armour and the <b>toe</b> <b>structure.</b> The probabilities of failure and economic consequences are time dependent, due to the sea level rise, the deterioration of the breakwater armour and the economic development of the port over the lifetime of 50 years. Therefore, all alternatives have different probabilities of failure for each year. Discounting all costs to a single year the economic optimal design geometry over the total lifetime proves to have a Core-loc element weight of 30. 8 t (14 m 3) and a crest height of 7 m +SWL. The construction costs of this geometry are 153 $ million. A crest height of 7 m +SWL complies with an allowable downtime of approximately 0. 2 %. The downtime costs are of considerable more influence than estimated by the port authority. Also the consequences of a breakwater collapse result in a 65 % heavier element weight. The discounted total costs over the lifetime of the breakwater are 219 $ million for the probabilistic design and 468 $ million for the deterministic design. The collapse costs and downtime costs have a significant influence on the total costs over the lifetime and therefore on the economic optimal geometry of the breakwater. A more robust design than deterministically derived can reduce the total cost over the lifetime by almost 50 %. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

In nature, geckos control adhesion by properly loading the compliant adhesive <b>structures</b> on their <b>toes.</b> These strongly anisotropic dry adhesive structures produce large frictional and adhesive forces when subjected to certain force/motion trajectories. Smooth detachment is obtained by simply reversing these trajectories. Each <b>toe’s</b> hierarchical <b>structure</b> facilitates intimate conformation to the climbing surface resulting in a balanced stress distribution across the entire adhesive area. By controlling the internal forces among feet, the gecko can achieve the loading conditions necessary to generate the desired amount of adhesion.

The manufacturing process of these Directional Polymer Stalks is detailed along with test results comparing them to conventional adhesives. I...|$|R

40|$|The breakwaters of IJmuiden are of {{a unique}} design; a riprap core {{is covered with a}} thick {{impermeable}} asphalt slab. During construction and after completion, slope instability caused extensive damage. Placement of a concrete cube armour layer prevented further damage to the asphalt, but proved to be unstable and required a significant amount of maintenance. Rijkswaterstaat (RWS), which is responsible for the maintenance, contracted a number of companies to investigate the strength and loading of the breakwaters. Lifting of the asphalt slab as a result of overpressure in the breakwater core was found to be the decisive failure mechanism. To determine the amount of overpressure, measurements were performed in both breakwater heads. A bigger favourable damping of wind waves was measured in the southern breakwater. Based on these measurements and other research outcomes RWS decided to change the maintenance strategy; armour units above the NPA – 2 m line will not be maintained in the future. The new strategy is based on the reasoning that the damping of wind waves reduces lifting forces and makes the weight of the armour layer redundant to prevent lifting. The mechanism(s) causing the larger damping in the southern breakwater are however unknown, this makes it hard to predict the amount of damping and therefore the magnitude of the loading of the asphalt during storm conditions. Aim of this thesis is to get insight in the stability of the asphalt slab during design storm conditions, and the necessity of an armour layer. Therefore the damping mechanism and the amount of damping during storm conditions need to be determined. Numerical modelling is performed to describe wave transmission through the breakwater and to evaluate the influence of different damping mechanisms. Most important mechanism causing additional damping is siltation of the <b>toe</b> <b>structure</b> of the southern breakwater. Along the Dutch coast the net longshore sediment transport is directed northwards. Therefore sediment passes the southern breakwater, part of the sand might settle in the toe and core of the breakwater. A sand layer with a height of 3. 3 m reduces the flow of water enough to cause the measured damping. The stability of the sand during storm conditions is checked using open filter sediment transport formula. Erosion of the sand layer is expected, however the erosion is expected to be in the order of centimetres which is insignificant. The damping mechanism causing the measured damping in the southern breakwater is determined; hence loading of the asphalt slab during design storm conditions can be determined. The thickness and quality of the asphalt slab is uncertain and might vary significantly over the length of the breakwaters. In order to get insight in the quality of the asphalt two cores were drilled in 2004. One showed high quality cohesive asphalt, the other showed low quality with low cohesion. Lifting of the asphalt cannot be ruled out. The dead weight of the designed asphalt slab in combination with a partial armour layer is not sufficient to resist the upward pressures during a design storm. The additional resistance needed against lifting can be provided by the weight of a complete armour layer or bending strength of the asphalt slab. The bending strength of the asphalt slab depends on {{the quantity and quality of}} the asphalt present. In order for the asphalt slab to have sufficient bending strength a top layer of high quality cohesive asphalt is required. Concluding, without additional information concerning the asphalt quality and thickness lifting of the asphalt slab and thereby failure of the breakwaters cannot be ruled out in case the armour layer erodes above a level of NAP - 2 m.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the hydraulic performance of riprap spurs and weirs in controlling bank erosion at the Southern part of the Raccoon River upstream U. S. Highway 169 Bridge utilizing the commercially available model FESWMS and field monitoring. It was found based on a 2 year monitoring and numerical modeling that the design of structures was overall successful, including their spacing and stability. The riprap material incorporated into the structures was directly and favorably correlated to the flow transmission through the structure, or in other words, dictated the permeable nature of the structure. It was found that the permeable dikes and weirs chosen in this study created less volume of scour in the vicinity of the <b>structure</b> <b>toes</b> and thus have less risk comparatively to other impermeable structures to collapse. The fact that the structures permitted the transmission of flow through them it allowed fine sand particles to fill in the gaps of the rock interstices and thus cement and better stabilize the structures. During bank-full flows the maximum scour hole was recorded away from the <b>structures</b> <b>toe</b> and the scourhole size was directly related to the protrusion angle of the structure to the flow. It was concluded that the proposed structure inclination with respect to the main flow direction was appropriate since it provides maximum bank protection while creating the largest volume of local scour away from the structure and towards the center of the channel. Furthermore, the lowest potential for bank erosion also occurs with the present set-up design chosen by the IDOT. About 2 ft of new material was deposited in the area located between the structures for the period extending from the construction day to May 2007. Surveys obtained by sonar and the presence of vegetation indicate that new material has been added at the bank <b>toes.</b> Finally, the <b>structures</b> provided higher variability in bed topography forming resting pools, creating flow shade on the leeward side of the structure, and separation of bed substrate due to different flow conditions. Another notable environmental benefit to rock riprap weirs and dikes is the creation of resting pools, especially in year 2007 (2 nd year of the project). The magnitude of these benefits to aquatic habitat has been found in the literature that is directly related to the induced scour-hole volume...|$|R

40|$|Tree frogs {{are able}} to climb smooth, {{vertical}} substrates using specialised toe pads which adhere via an area-based wet adhesive mechanism. Although the link between pads and arboreality in frogs is well-established, few studies have investigated the influence of morphology on adhesion. Trinidadian tree frogs from the genus Hyla are geometrically similar. There is a tendency towards comparatively reduced mass in larger species, but toe pad area increases as expected with isometry. As adhesion is area-dependent, forces are affected directly by the increase in mass relative to pad area, {{and there is a}} decrease in the ability of larger species to adhere to smooth rotation platforms. However, there is an increase in force per unit area that suggests larger species have more efficient toe pads. <b>Toe</b> pad <b>structure</b> is very similar though there are variations in the details of a number of features. Crucially, although differences in morphology appeared small they had demonstrable effects on adhesive efficiency of the pads.

Block ramps or rock chutes are often used to control scour downstream of hydraulic structures and have the peculiarity to be ecofriendly. Although these structures assure great energy dissipation, the rapid passage from supercritical to subcritical flow at the toe results in a scour hole with geometric parameters {{that have to be}} evaluated in order to avoid foundation problems.

Unrelated to the exigencies of flight, the legs always have three long bones, and all the birds walk on their <b>toes.</b> This leg <b>structure</b> is a striking plesiomorphic feature that was already present in related dinosaurs. The multi-purpose potential of the legs {{is the result of}} the skeletal architecture of a body with three segmented flexed legs. This configuration provides mechanical properties that allow the use of the legs as propulsive, paddling, foraging or grooming tools. It is the association of diverse modes of locomotion-walking, running, hopping, flying and swimming-that have enabled the birds to colonize almost all the environments on Earth...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{prediction}} of structural instabilities in open pit mines {{are an important}} design and operational consideration for ensuring safety and productivity of the operation. Unstable wedges and blocks occurring at {{the surface of the}} pit walls may be identified through three-dimensional (3 D) image analysis combined with the discrete fracture network (DFN) approach. Kinematic analysis based on polyhedral modelling can be used for first pass analysis but cannot capture composite failure mechanisms involving both structurally controlled and rock mass progressive failures. A methodology is proposed in this paper to overcome such limitations by coupling DFN models with geomechanical simulations based on the discrete element method (DEM). Further, high resolution photogrammetric data are used to identify valid model scenarios. An identified wedge failure that occurred in an Australian coal mine is used to validate the methodology. In this particular case, the failure surface was induced {{as a result of the}} rock mass progressive failure that developed from the <b>toe</b> of the <b>structure</b> inside the intact rock matrix. Analysis has been undertaken to determine in what scenarios the measured and predicted failure surfaces can be used to calibrate strength parameters in the model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{hydraulic}} jump {{is characterized by}} strong energy dissipation and mix-ing, large-scale turbulence, air entrainment, waves, and spray. Despite recent pertinent studies, the interaction between air bubbles diffusion and momentum transfer is not completely understood. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present experimental results from new measurements performed in a rectangular horizontal flume with partially developed inflow conditions. The vertical distributions of the void fraction and the air bubbles count rate were recorded for inflow Froude number Fr 1 in the range from 5. 2 to 14. 3. Rapid detrainment process was observed near the jump <b>toe,</b> whereas the <b>structure</b> of the air diffusion layer was clearly observed over longer distances. These new data were compared with previous data generally collected at lower Fro-ude numbers. The comparison demonstrated that, at a fixed distance from the jump toe, the maximum void fraction Cmax increases with the increasing Fr 1. The vertical locations of the maximum void fraction and bubble count rate were consistent with previous studies. Finally, an empirical correlation between the upper boundary of the air diffusion layer and the distance from the impingement point was derived...|$|R
40|$|Cryo-scanning {{electron}} microscopy (cryo-SEM) and {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) offer new avenues {{for the study of}} the morphology of tree frog adhesive toe pads. Using these techniques, we compare toe pad microstructure in two distantly related species of tree frog, Litoria caerulea, White (Hylidae) and Rhacophorus prominanus, Smith (Rhacophoridae), in which the toe pads are considered to be convergent. AFM demonstrates the extraordinary similarity of both surface microstructures (largely hexagonal epithelial cells surrounded by deep channels) and nanostructures (an array of nanopillars, ca. 350 nm in diameter, all with a small dimple at the apex). The cryo-SEM studies examined the distribution of the fibrillar cytoskeleton within the different layers of the stratified toe pad epithelium, demonstrating that the cytoskeletal elements (keratin tonofilaments) that lie at an angle to the surface are relatively poorly developed in L. caerulea, clearly so in comparison to R. prominanus. Cryo-SEM also enabled the visualization of the fluid layer that is critical to a toe pad's adhesive function. This was achieved by examination of the frozen fluid residues left behind after removal of a toe within the cryo-SEM's experimental chamber. Such ‘toeprints’ demonstrated the presence of a wedge of fluid surrounding each toe pad, as well as fluid filling the channels that surround each epithelial cell. Cryo-SEM was used to examine epithelial cell shape. In a sample of 582 cells, 59. 5 % were hexagonal, the remainder being mainly pentagonal (23. 1 %) or heptagonal (16. 1 %). The distribution of differently-shaped cells was not random, but was not associated with either pad curvature or the distribution of mucous pores that provide fluid for the frogs' wet adhesion mechanism. Our main finding, the great similarity of <b>toe</b> pad <b>structure</b> in these two species, has important implications for biomimetics, for such convergent evolution suggests a good starting point for attempts to develop adhesives that will function in wet conditions...|$|R

What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water; and no one except Audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes webbed, alight {{on the surface of}} the sea. On the other hand grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants, yet the water-hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot; and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such cases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. The webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in function, though not in structure.

40|$|Mole rat (Scaptochirus moschatus), a soil-burrowing mammal, can {{efficiently}} dig soil {{using its}} fore claws. The profile curves of its claw <b>toe</b> provide excellent <b>structure</b> for digging. In this paper, a biomimetic stubble-cutting disc {{was designed by}} learning from the geometrical characteristics of the mole rat claw toes. To compare the structural strength and working effi-ciency of the biomimetic disc and the conventional stubble-cutting disc, three-dimensional (3 D) models of the discs were built and numerical analyzed in ABAQUS. In the dynamic soil cutting model, soil was modeled as an elastic-plastic material with elastic parameters, including Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and Drucker-Prager criterion, which were obtained from triaxial tests. A general contact algorithm was used to simulate the interaction between rotary disc and soil. In FEA models, for the combined action of normal and friction stresses, the stress on the biomimetic disc is 34. 33 % {{lower than that of}} the conventional disc. For only the normal stress, the stress on the biomimetic disc is 22. 64 % lower than that on the conventional one. The magnitude of soil stress in biomimetic disc cutting model is 6. 87 % higher than that in conventional disc. The FEA results indicate that the biomimetic disc performs better in structural strength and cutting efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Cave {{animals are}} often adapted to digging and life underground, with claw <b>toes</b> similar in <b>structure</b> and {{function}} to a sampling scoop. In this paper, the clawed toes of the Himalayan marmot were selected as a biological prototype for bionic research. Based on geometric parameter optimization of the clawed toes, a bionic sampling scoop {{for use on}} Mars was designed. Using a 3 D laser scanner, the point cloud data of the second front claw toe was acquired. Parametric equations and contour curves for the claw were then built with cubic polynomial fitting. We obtained 18 characteristic curve equations for {{the internal and external}} contours of the claw. A bionic sampling scoop was designed according to the structural parameters of Curiosity’s sampling shovel and the contours of the Himalayan marmot’s claw. Verifying test results showed that when the penetration angle was 45 ° and the sampling speed was 0. 33 [*]r/min, the bionic sampling scoops’ resistance torque was 49. 6 % less than that of the prototype sampling scoop. When the penetration angle was 60 ° and the sampling speed was 0. 22 [*]r/min, the resistance torque of the bionic sampling scoop was 28. 8 % lower than that of the prototype sampling scoop...|$|R
40|$|From 1909 to 1968, the Hollinger Mine {{produced}} over 53 millions tons of gold tailings {{stored in}} a structure {{referred to as the}} Hollinger Tailings Stack. Covering some 190 hectares, up to 25 metres deep, with over 600, 000 cubic metres of ponded waters and no spillway, the stack placed at risk some 150 mobile homes located at the <b>toe</b> of the <b>structure.</b> Preliminary assessments of the structure’s stability rated the site to be a high hazard. In 1992, the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) declared the tailings site to be abandoned and requested that the City of Timmins declare the site to be an emergency. These declarations permitted the Crown to enter the property and carry out much needed remediation work over a period of two years. This paper will present in detail the approach used by the MNDM to solve both the legal and technical problems associated with the remediation of the site. Geotechnical analyses and hydrologic modeling results are discussed as well as construction and revegetation techniques used by the contractors. In 1996 and 2000, policy and regulations were amended to enable the Crown to be better equipped to deal with such emergencies and to prevent similar problems from re-occurring in the future...|$|R
