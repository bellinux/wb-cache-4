500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> in mind... â€”architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|Celine Dion {{performed}} the song {{as part of}} her A New Day... concert at Caesars Palace. The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the most kick out of in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure." [...] Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E

6000|$|... "Talking of girls," [...] said Mrs. Reeves impatiently, [...] "I am almost discouraged. It {{is so hard}} to get a good all-round <b>one.</b> <b>The</b> last <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> was so saucy <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to {{discharge}} her, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> now cannot make decent bread. <b>I</b> never <b>had</b> good luck with bread myself either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't a {{dress in}} the world but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> on, and a few others like it. Oh, Harry, how can you talk in that way?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{last thing}} I remembered before {{dropping}} into dreamless slumber was hearing a bell tinkle in the forest, which I recognized as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> placed on Satan.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can {{you tell}} me which is the horse I have caught, and which is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> before?' said the youth. 'If you can't, I think your {{daughter}} is mine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's up?" [...] I cried, with a queer {{high note}} getting into my voice somehow. At that the candle on the {{wardrobe}} went out, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> relit in the alcove followed.|$|E
60|$|I {{afterwards}} {{found that}} there were many such caverns among the islands of the South Seas, some of them larger and more beautiful than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just described.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can have}} a special, sir, in twenty minutes, but you cannot catch <b>the</b> boat. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just sent off would never do it, but the boat has a Royal command to wait for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{said the}} King, fretfully pacing {{up and down}} the room. [...] "I always keep my promises, no matter how foolish they are. But I shall make an {{ornament}} of the yellow hen to replace <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just lost." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw him {{raise his}} gun ever so little and bend forward, {{and at that}} moment out flashed two woodcocks into the open, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> missed to his right, and the other to his left.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's up?" [...] I cried, with a queer {{high note}} getting into my voice somehow. At that the candle {{on the corner}} of the {{wardrobe}} went out, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> relit in the alcove followed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{took the}} wrong road," [...] Ned said; [...] "and as {{they told me}} that there was but a mile or two {{difference}} between them, I thought I might as well keep on <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> first taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{seems to}} bring me very near to him in thought. Send me one of his autographs to paste into it. I don't like to cut out <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in <b>the</b> long letter to the Scottish Episcopal Church, which you kindly sent me.|$|R
60|$|Farther: the {{beautiful}} power of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> drawn in its spring life, {{is in the}} opposition of its dark purple to the primrose in England, and the pale yellow anemone in the Alps. And its individual name will be, therefore, 'Contorta purpurea'--Purple Wreathe-wort.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unfortunately," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{have but}} one cat now ready, for I carried two to {{children}} in the town yesterday. And <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> shall be given to your brother, Mayrie, {{because he is the}} smaller; and <b>the</b> next <b>one</b> <b>I</b> make shall be for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{loosening}} from me swift she said: [...] "O why, why feign to be [...] <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> meant!--to whom I have sped [...] To fly with, {{being so}} sorrily wed!" [...] - 'Twas thus and thus that she upbraided me.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,--It is {{very late}} at night, and I am writing in my room, {{which is not}} quite as large or as nice as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> at home. My board, washing and lodging cost me seventy-five dollars a month.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want {{a boy to}} tend my cattle,' he said abruptly, 'as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> has run away. Will {{you stay}} and do it?' and Peronnik, though he loved his liberty and hated work, recollected the good food he had eaten, and agreed to stop.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mrs. Garvin, {{you must}} be sensible," [...] he said. [...] "This {{is no place for}} a sick child. And it is such a nice little hospital, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in mind, and so many {{children}} get well and strong there," [...] he added, cheerfully.|$|R
5000|$|According to Nesmith, {{the songs}} {{played on the}} album touched a chronological and {{thematic}} history of Nesmith's solo music. He stated, [...] "I picked my favorites to play, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to love over the years, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> that are most requested by fans of my solo work." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the left}} {{you see a}} church, {{standing}} in a very high position, with a still steeper ascent than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been describing, leading up to it. On the right is a winding road for carriages, which leads up, by a tolerably gentle ascent, to the great square.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, no, Tom!" [...] responded William Philander Tubbs. [...] "I {{had another}} suit on, {{the one with}} the green stripe, don't you know,-- <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made last September-- or maybe it was in October, I can't really remember. But you must know the suit, don't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|As we {{were sitting}} round the camp-fire, eating breakfast, R.C. and Edd returned; and R.C. carried a turkey gobbler the very size and color of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> shot the night before. R.C.'s face wore the keen, pleased {{expression}} characteristic of it when he had just had some unusual and satisfying experience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Curiously {{enough when}} he--when Mr. Erwin spoke of you I {{seemed to get}} a very {{different}} idea of you than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always had. I {{had to go out}} of town, but I made up my mind I'd come to see you as soon as I got back, and ask you to tell me something about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything's up," [...] gasped the breathless Barker. [...] "It's all {{up about}} these stocks. It's all a mistake; all an infernal lie of that newspaper. <b>I</b> never <b>had</b> {{the right kind}} of shares. <b>The</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> are {{worthless}} rags"; and the next instant he had blurted out his whole interview with the bank manager.|$|R
5000|$|During that time, {{and largely}} at Princeton, I met Serre, Thom, Hirzebruch, Atiyah, Singer, Milnor, Borel, Harish-Chandra, James, Adams,... I {{could go on}} and on. But these people, {{together}} with Kodaira and Spencer, and my more or less [...] "personal remedial tutor", Arnold Shapiro, were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> most mathematical contact with.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any one {{can play}} {{if he has}} music in him and such an {{instrument}} as this in his possession," [...] he argued, after he had finished. [...] "To show that it is all right and in perfect tune, I will put up <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been playing upon. How much am I offered?" ...|$|R
60|$|Substituting a stout stick for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thrown aside {{at the top}} of the precipice, we now {{continued}} our course {{along the}} bed of the ravine. Soon we were saluted by a sound in advance, that grew by degrees louder and louder, as the noise of the cataract we were leaving behind gradually died on our ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think they}} will try, Jake. They {{are more likely to}} heap {{brushwood}} against the door and windows and set it alight, and then shoot us down as we rush out. This hut is not like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to defend against the Iroquois. That was built to repel Indians' attacks; this is a mere squatter's hut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, I hope not. I {{never had}} a fight at school except <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> three months after I got there, and I only had that one row you speak of with a clerk. I don't {{think it would be}} fair, you see, to get into rows with fellows who have no idea how {{thoroughly}} I have been taught." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the novel}} was shunned by critics and the reading public upon its initial {{publication}} in 1948, White himself expressed a personal fondness for it: [...] "It is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> most affection for," [...] {{he wrote in}} 1959, [...] "and I always find it irritating that only six Australians seem to have liked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] quoth Percival, [...] "that may not be, for in {{a little}} while now I must leave you. For, though I shall be sad to go from such a {{friendly}} place as this is, yet I am an errant knight, and as I am errant I must fulfil many adventures besides <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> accomplished here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might take}} off your heavy coat," [...] said she; [...] "you need not be on parade here. And instead of that awful hat, I can make you one of long grass. Do you see <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> on? Isn't that a good hat? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> nearly {{finished}} which I am making for my father; you may have that." ...|$|R
