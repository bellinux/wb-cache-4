25|$|Interactions between {{ethnic groups}} in formal {{settings}} can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, a political scientist, who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed. She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to treat each other with respect, {{making it easier for}} individuals belonging to the minority group <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> form relationships with everyone else. Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.|$|E

This was despite Capcom holding it for 8 months after completion, with the game finally releasing when the Game Boy Advance was already in its first year of existence.

Bozon believed that from a creative standpoint, he never really settled on a target audience, with the character being [...] "iconoclastic", [...] "too sexy to be a kid's brand, and too girly for a male gamer brand". Also, before the game was even released, Bozon claims that he had come to understand anyway that the game [...] "would probably not sell", as during WayForward's search for a publisher, many market analysts were skeptical at {{the idea of having a}} female lead character, and Bozon ultimately acknowledged that they probably [...] "genuinely knew their markets".

After an interview Erdely gave to Slate, in which she was questioned about the way she investigated the piece, some commentators escalated their questioning of the veracity of the article. It was later revealed Erdely had not interviewed any of the men accused of the rape. Erdely defended her decision not to interview the accused by saying that the contact page on the fraternity's website [...] "was pretty outdated".

[...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that will have you staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a Saturday night, in my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that bad when she says [...] ".

5000|$|Port-tack approach: This {{starting}} {{technique was}} created to allow skippers take advantage of 'holes' in the start line. Every short course race starts with a windward leg.

As a result, many of the racers will group {{on one end of}} the start line trying to outmaneuver each other for clean air.
