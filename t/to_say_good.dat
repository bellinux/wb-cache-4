After a difficult battle Narud's forces were overpowered and Narud was cornered by not only Artanis Kerrigan and Raynor, but Alexei Stukov, who called him [...] "Duran." [...] He asked Duran if he remembered {{what he had done}} to him, and Narud assumed Stukov was simply there to gloat. Stukov said [...] "No, I'm here <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good</b> night you son of a bitch." [...] (an echo of the words Duran had said right before shooting him). He then shot Narud with a psychic blast, finishing him for good.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2000, Suzuki {{released}} [...] "Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Good</b> Bye" [...] which debuted {{at number}} 5. A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one.　Suzuki has said {{of this first}} period of her career {{that she was not}} free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling [...] "pretty disheartened and down, like there was no future.". Suzuki had been writing lyrics from an early age and passing them to her manager and producers. The first song to feature them, with the help of Mitsuko and Tetsuya Komuro, was her tenth Sony single, [...] "Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Good</b> Bye". The lyrics were influenced by events occurring in her personal life at that time, specifically her upcoming high school graduation and she has said [...] "it was more important to me than sales and chart rankings to know that I had put my thoughts and feelings into what I was singing."　Three months after Infinity Eighteen Vol.1, Suzuki released her twelfth single, [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] in the beginning of April and third studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 at the end of April. [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] sold a total of 234,000 copies reaching number one and Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 sold a total of 427,000 copies reaching number two. [...] "Reality/Dancin' in Hip-Hop" [...] was Suzuki's 12th single released under the Sony Music Japan label, on 27 September 2000. It reached number 3 on Oricon weekly chart and sold a total of 211,000 copies. A compilation album of Suzuki's tracks, Fun for Fan, was released on 30 May 2001. It reached number 1 on the Oricon charts, despite the fact that by this point, Suzuki herself had vanished from the public eye and Sony had taken all of her previous singles and albums off CD shelves.|$|E
2500|$|Cope {{describes}} Mrs. Phillips' dinner, {{the fine}} {{house and its}} appointments. He thought Randolph was especially attentive to him at dinner and that Joe found him boisterous: [...] "He must have fancied me (from the racket I was making) {{as a sort of}} free-and-easy Hercules..., if not as the whole football squad rolled into one." [...] Cope tried not to shake Joe's hand too vigorously, but Joe [...] "took all I gave and even seemed to hang on for a little more."(63) He notices Joe indicate by glances to Mrs. Phillips that he is disappointed Cope does not sing on this occasion. Randolph walks Cope home and then ends the evening, in Cope's words, [...] "taking my hand <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good</b> night and taking his own time in dropping it."(66) In a letter, Cope urges his friend Arthur Lemoyne to leave Winnebago and come to live with him: [...] "...we can go into quarters together: a real bed instead of an upholstered shelf and a closet big enough for two wardrobes."(67) Randolph visits Cope in his modest rooms and Cope finds him not at all judgmental. Cope returns the visit and they discuss the authors of Shakespeare's plays. Randolph takes Cope to dinner and the theater. When Cope declines alcohol, Randolph feels [...] "like a corrupter of youth,"(74) but he is pleased that Cope treats him as a peer and never calls him [...] "sir." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{is nothing}} so {{interesting}} as telling {{a good man}} or woman how bad one has been. It is intellectually fascinating. One of the greatest pleasures of having been wicked is that one has so much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the <b>good.</b>|$|R

60|$|I refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good</b> night--I {{refused to}} let him go. His wanting to go was in itself a reproach to me. He had never done it before. I asked him to sit down again.|$|E
