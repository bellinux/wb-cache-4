50|$|A {{high rate}} of {{mortality}} from infectious European diseases and warfare due to the fur trade increased the frequency and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead until the Wyandot dispersal in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century. <b>The</b> last reported <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead occurred in 1695.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat {{received}} largely positive reviews, {{with several}} reviewers {{commenting on the}} book's depiction {{of the relationship between}} sexuality and power, and on the graphic descriptions of violent events.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{also the}} host to <b>the</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Nazarene, held every January 9, which draws {{millions}} of Catholic devotees. Other religious festivities held in Manila are the Feast of Santo Niño in Tondo and Pandacan held on the third Sunday of January and <b>the</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nuestra Señora de los Desamparados de Manila (Our Lady of the Abandoned), {{the patron saint of}} Santa Ana and held every May 12.

5|$|In {{a private}} {{printing}} of 1899, Provost Shadwell lists thirteen Gaudies observed by the College during the 18th century; {{by the end}} of the 19th century all but two, <b>the</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Immaculate Conception and the Purification of the Virgin, had ceased to be celebrated.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{tradition}} <b>of</b> opening <b>the</b> Festival {{season with}} a <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> Will (initially <b>the</b> <b>Feasting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tribe <b>of</b> Will) was initiated in 1956 in Lithia Park with Miss Oregon and then state senator Mark Hatfield attending.|$|R
50|$|Every year on 8 September <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> <b>the</b> Nativity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary is celebrated.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} patronal fiesta, another major parish <b>feast</b> is <b>the</b> “Fiestang Corazon” (<b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart <b>of</b> Jesus) on <b>the</b> 3rd Saturday <b>of</b> October. According to tradition, the harvest season {{was the reason}} why <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> is celebrated in thanksgiving on October instead <b>of</b> June, which is <b>the</b> <b>feast’s</b> liturgical month. Unknown to many, the parishioners were on the right liturgical track. Research shows that, in pre-Vatican II times, <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart fell on <b>the</b> Sunday before <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> Christ <b>the</b> King, which is celebrated at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> October.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goats {{major themes}} include {{political}} corruption, machismo, memory, and writing and power. Olga Lorenzo, reviewer for The Melbourne Age, suggests that overall Vargas Llosa's {{aim is to}} reveal the irrational forces of Latin tradition {{that give rise to}} despotism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's <b>The</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat, for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years {{in light of his}} anti-communist leanings.|$|E
5|$|April 8 through April 10. <b>The</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law. These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote the Book of the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, usually at noon.|$|E
25|$|His {{return on}} <b>the</b> 14th <b>of</b> November, 1606, is a date to {{remember}} in <b>the</b> annals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New World, as <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first North American order <b>of</b> chivalry and <b>the</b> birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nouveau Noblesse <b>of</b> New France. <b>The</b> <b>feasting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order occurred weekly and continued throughout the winter until <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> March, only to recommence {{annually in the}} Fall.|$|R
25|$|The phrases used on <b>the</b> Great <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord (excluding Palm Sunday and Pascha) are {{not said}} on Sundays, but are {{replaced}} with the normal Sunday phrase: May He Who rose from the dead... Furthermore, on <b>the</b> Great <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord, and from Palm Sunday through Thomas Sunday (the Sunday after Easter) neither <b>the</b> patron saint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church nor <b>the</b> saint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day are mentioned in the dismissal.|$|R

5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for <b>the</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative {{the words of}} the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's translation of the biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition as he had done with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E
5|$|Every {{second week}} of January, Romblon town celebrates <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santo Niño de Cebú, {{also known as the}} Biniray Festival. In that week, a fluvial parade {{featuring}} the image of the Santo Niño goes around Romblon Bay in order to bring good luck to the villages. A mardi gras is also held in the town with various street dancing, food, drinks and music. A similar Biniray Festival also occurs in Banton every 10 September in commemoration of the island's patron, San Nicolas de Tolentino. Other festivals include the Saginyogan Festival in Alcantara, the Sanrokan Festival in Banton, and the Talabukon Festival in Looc.|$|E
5|$|In 1724 <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Visitation fell on {{the fourth}} Sunday after Trinity, thus the next cantata Bach {{composed}} was a chorale cantata for the fifth Sunday after Trinity. Bach did apparently not compose a cantata for the sixt Sunday after Trinity in 1724 while absent from Leipzig. Bach's second year in Leipzig passed without composing a chorale cantata specifically for the fourth Sunday after Trinity. He composed one for this occasion in 1732, Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV177, one of the later additions to the chorale cantata cycle. Also for TrinityVI Bach composed a chorale cantata {{at a later date}} (BWV9).|$|E
2500|$|This {{distinction}} is in application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Vatican Council: [...] "Lest <b>the</b> <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints should {{take precedence over}} <b>the</b> <b>feasts</b> which commemorate <b>the</b> very mysteries <b>of</b> salvation, many of them {{should be left to}} be celebrated by a particular Church or nation or family of religious; only those should be extended to the universal Church which commemorate saints who are truly of universal importance." ...|$|R

50|$|By {{the period}} when the Wyandot {{migrated}} to Wendake (on <b>the</b> south shore <b>of</b> Georgian Bay in modern-day Simcoe and Grey counties in Ontario), these mortuary rituals came to represent the unity and friendship of Wyandot bands. Multiple villages would gather together for combined ceremonies and to exchange gifts. <b>The</b> exchange <b>of</b> gifts and <b>the</b> symbolism <b>of</b> a united burial ground became defining elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead.|$|R
5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in <b>The</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Kourkouas assailed Edessa {{every year}} from 942 onward and devastated its countryside, {{as he had done}} at Melitene. Finally, its emir agreed to a peace, {{swearing}} not to raise arms against Byzantium and to hand over the Mandylion in exchange for the return of 200 prisoners. The Mandylion was conveyed to Constantinople, where it arrived on August 15, 944, on <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dormition of the Theotokos. A triumphal entry was staged for the venerated relic, which was then deposited in the Theotokos of the Pharos church, the palatine chapel of the Great Palace. As for Kourkouas, he concluded his campaign by sacking Bithra (modern Birecik) and Germanikeia (modern Kahramanmaraş).|$|E
5|$|Rafael Trujillo, known also as The Goat, The Chief, and The Benefactor, is a fictionalized {{character}} {{based on}} the real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952. In <b>The</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat, Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his own perspective.|$|E
50|$|According to this {{programme}} {{the collection}} was to comprise sixteen volumes, besides two volumes of explanations and tables. The first volume was to present documents concerning <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> Jesus Christ and <b>the</b> <b>feasts</b> established in honour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special events <b>of</b> His life; <b>the</b> second volume would {{be devoted to}} <b>the</b> life and <b>the</b> <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Virgin, and <b>the</b> third to <b>the</b> <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saints honoured with a more special cult. The twelve succeeding volumes were to give <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints whose <b>feasts</b> are celebrated respectively in <b>the</b> twelve months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, one volume for each month. This calendar arrangement had been prescribed by his superiors, in preference to the chronological order Rosweyde himself favoured. But this presented, especially at that time, formidable difficulties. Lastly, the sixteenth volume was to set forth <b>the</b> succession <b>of</b> martyrologies which had been in use at different periods and in <b>the</b> various Churches <b>of</b> Christendom. <b>The</b> first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two supplementary volumes was to contain notes and commentaries bearing on the lives divided into eight books treating among other subjects: <b>the</b> authors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lives, <b>the</b> sufferings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> martyrs, and <b>the</b> images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> weeks <b>of</b> Ordinary Time are numbered. Several Sundays bear <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>feasts</b> or solemnities {{celebrated on}} those days, {{including}} Trinity Sunday and <b>the</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> Christ <b>the</b> King.|$|R

Kuswad is a term used for the sweet delicacies prepared during Christmas which include Kulkuls, Neuries and Perada.|$|R
5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that <b>The</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|The Serbian Orthodox Church {{decided to}} {{celebrate}} the 600th anniversary of the monk Lazar's invention and construction of the great clock tower in the Moscow Kremlin on <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presentation of Mary (Ваведење) on 4 December 2004. The liturgies of the churches in Belgrade and Moscow, the Hilandar (where the brotherhood had their krsna slava) and the Monastery of the Holy Archangels, mentioned Lazar. A memorial sundial {{was placed on the}} Academy of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|A {{new site}} for the cathedral was {{selected}} above Caine Road by the Glenealy Ravine and {{the cornerstone of the}} new church was laid on 8 December 1883. Crawley and Company of London were hired to be the architects and five years later, construction was completed. The church opened on 7 December 1888, the vigil of <b>the</b> <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Immaculate Conception, and was blessed one day later. The construction of the cathedral cost US$15,400, and since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt, the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until 8 December 1938, exactly fifty years after it first opened. The ceremony was officiated by the Vicar Apostolic of Hong Kong Enrico Valtorta, the Bishop of Macau José da Costa Nunes and the Bishop Emeritus of Canton; three of the cathedral's altars were also consecrated.|$|E
