5|$|As Peter {{exits the}} {{abortion}} clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion (as {{a reference to}} the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film Reefer Madness), portraying it as murder, larceny, jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E
2500|$|The {{document}} also acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> {{often are}} a result of poverty and helplessness and that the Church and society should [...] "work out effective measures to protect motherhood." ...|$|R
50|$|Ostapovitch is a {{candidate}} representing the Liberal National Party at the 2016 federal election for the seat of Rankin. She has claimed <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> {{increase the risk of}} breast cancer.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 Act—as {{amended by}} s37 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990—explicitly notes <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> {{performed}} {{under the terms}} of the 1967 Act are not offences under the 1929 Act.|$|R
5|$|Major medical {{organizations}} {{which have}} analyzed data {{on abortion and}} breast cancer have uniformly concluded <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> does not cause breast cancer. These organizations include the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|Agnes Mary Mansour (April 10, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American Roman Catholic nun who {{was given}} a choice from the Vatican in 1983 to end her {{religious}} vows or to resign from her position {{as the director of}} the Michigan Department of Social Services which required her to support and allocate public funding for abortions. The controversy involved her belief <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> was tragic but should be legal, despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E
50|$|Three referendums {{were held}} on 9 February on abortion, {{immigration}} and the rail network. The <b>abortion</b> referendum proposed <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> {{would no longer}} be funded through health insurance, but should be paid for privately by the mother.|$|R
5000|$|The first Quebec {{case was}} in 1973. Morgentaler used the defence of necessity, <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> were {{necessary}} for his patients' life or health. The jury acquitted him. However, Quebec's provincial appeal court reversed the acquittal {{and replaced it}} with a conviction and a prison term.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the law {{states that}} [...] "account {{may be taken}} of the {{pregnant}} woman's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment", suggesting <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> can be performed on socio-economic grounds. Belize does not provide an explicit exception for pregnancies that {{are the result of}} rape or incest.|$|R
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, and the scientific community has concluded <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> does not cause breast cancer and that breast cancer should not be a concern for women who are considering having an abortion. This consensus is supported by major medical bodies, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> should be defended {{according}} to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
25|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} induced abortion {{increases the risk}} of developing breast cancer. This position contrasts with the scientific consensus <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> does not cause breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|One {{provision}} of the Akron statute required <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> after the first trimester be performed in a hospital. The Court found this unconstitutional, because while {{the state has a}} compelling interest in regulating abortion after the first trimester, accepted medical practice does not recommend <b>that</b> all second-trimester <b>abortions</b> be performed in a hospital. The regulation imposed an unnecessary burden that has the effect of infringing upon the constitutional right to an abortion.|$|R
50|$|The abortion-breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{is the belief}} <b>that</b> induced <b>abortions</b> {{increase the risk of}} developing breast cancer. This belief is in contrast to the scientific consensus that there is no evidence suggesting <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> can cause breast cancer. Despite the scientific community rejecting the hypothesis, many pro-life advocates continue to argue that a link between abortions and breast cancer exists, in an effort to influence public policy and opinion to further restrict abortions and discourage women from having abortions. While historically a controversial hypothesis, the debate now is almost entirely political rather than scientific.|$|R
50|$|In {{a written}} answer to Jim Allister the Northern Ireland health {{minister}} Edwin Poots disclosed <b>that</b> 394 <b>abortions</b> {{were carried out}} in Northern hospitals for the period 2005/06 to 2009/10 with the footnote <b>that</b> reasons for <b>abortions</b> were not gathered centrally.|$|R
25|$|A Gallup poll {{conducted}} in May 2014 indicates that 50% of Americans believe that abortions should be legal under certain circumstances, 28% believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances, and 21% believe <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> should be illegal in all circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Though Koop {{was opposed}} to {{abortion}} on personal and religious grounds, he declined to state <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> procedures performed by qualified medical professionals posed a substantial health risk to the women whose pregnancies were being terminated, despite political pressure to endorse such a position.|$|E
25|$|Tertullian, a 2nd- and 3rd-century Christian theologian argued <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> {{should be}} {{performed}} only in cases in which abnormal positioning of the fetus in the womb would endanger {{the life of the}} pregnant women. Saint Augustine, in Enchiridion, makes passing mention of surgical procedures being performed to remove fetuses which have died in utero.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism {{are usually}} {{aligned with the}} {{interfaith}} Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. Orthodox {{organizations such as the}} Orthodox Union and Agudas Yisrael have occasionally partnered with pro-choice organizations when necessary to ensure <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> will be available to women whose lives are endangered by the fetus.|$|R
5000|$|Abortion-rights {{individuals}} rarely {{consider themselves}} [...] "pro-abortion", because they consider termination of a pregnancy as a bodily autonomy issue, and find forced abortion {{to be as}} legally and morally indefensible as the outlawing of abortion. Indeed, some who support abortion rights consider themselves opposed to some or all abortions on a moral basis, but believe <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> would happen in any case and <b>that</b> legal <b>abortion</b> under medically controlled conditions is preferable to illegal back-alley abortion without proper medical supervision. Such people believe the death rate of women due to such procedures in areas where abortions are only available outside of the medical establishment is unacceptable.|$|R
25|$|Chemotherapy is {{teratogenic}} during pregnancy, {{especially during}} the first trimester, to the extent <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy. Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and adverse effects on cognitive development, but it may {{increase the risk of}} various complications of pregnancy and fetal myelosuppression.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Minnesota's Star Tribune {{newspaper}} {{opined that}} {{the credibility of}} Pawlenty's commissioner of health, Dianne Mandernach, suffered when a website posting by the department suggested <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> might {{have a role in}} breast cancer. She also angered many when it was learned she had delayed releasing government research on cancer in miners. In 2007, Mandernach resigned.|$|E
25|$|A 1989 {{survey found}} that 75.8 percent of its {{respondents}} believed <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> should be legally permitted if the mother's life is in danger or the child would be born deformed. More recently in 2000, 77.9 percent of survey respondents said abortion should be permitted if the mother's life is in danger, and 55.1 {{percent of respondents said}} abortion should be permitted if the pregnancy is the result of rape.|$|E
25|$|Congress should {{eliminate}} {{federal funding}} for clinics and medical facilities <b>that</b> provide <b>abortion</b> services.|$|R
50|$|Hospitals had Therapeutic Abortion Committees {{only if they}} {{opted to}} provide abortions, and there was and is no {{requirement}} that they do so. As well, the requirement for three doctors {{to sit on a}} committee, in addition to the doctor who proposed to perform an <b>abortion,</b> meant <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> were only available in hospitals where there were four doctors familiar with the procedure.|$|R
50|$|The pro-life {{movement}} {{is concerned that}} there are no legal restrictions against abortion in Canada, and <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> are funded by provincial health care programs, even if the abortion is not for therapeutic reasons. A medical reason for obtaining an abortion is no longer required in Canada (except in Prince Edward Island) since the 1988 removal of abortion from the Criminal Code.|$|R
25|$|Feminists for Life {{was founded}} by Pat Goltz and Cathy Callaghan in Ohio in 1972. Goltz and Callaghan met in a judo club {{on the campus of}} Ohio State University, where Callaghan was a tenured {{professor}} of linguistics. In 1974, Goltz was expelled from the Columbus, Ohio, chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) for arguing <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> violated feminist principles, although she and Callaghan were not expelled from national NOW membership.|$|E
25|$|When {{surveyed}} by The Tennessean, Cooper {{said that he}} thinks the state constitution should be changed {{so that it would}} specify that abortions are not guaranteed, but <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> should be permitted by the constitution when incest, rape, or the mother's life are involved. He also does not support civil unions and domestic partnerships being legal in Tennessee. According to Project Vote Smart, he has voted to raise cigarette taxes and for allowing handguns to be carried in state parks.|$|E
25|$|Koop, an {{opponent}} of abortion, resisted pressure from the Reagan administration in 1987 to prepare a report stating <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> was psychologically harmful to women. He {{said it was not}} a public health issue but a moral one. Koop assigned an assistant, George Walter, the task of researching the matter. Walter obtained a list of articles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), authored mostly by CDC abortion-surveillance staff, and consulted with Alan Guttmacher Institute personnel. Walter wrote a draft report on his findings and gave it to Koop.|$|E
5000|$|Aristotle {{developed}} {{a theory of}} progressive ensoulment. In On the Generation of Animals, he declared that the soul develops first a vegetative soul, then animal, and finally human, adding <b>that</b> <b>abortions</b> were permissible early in pregnancy, before certain biological processes began. He believed that the female substance was passive, the male active, and that it required time for the male substance to [...] "animate" [...] the whole.|$|R
