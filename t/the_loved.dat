5|$|In September 1945, {{after he}} was {{released}} by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944) but {{spent much of the}} next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the Nuremberg trials, and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria, said to be the founder of international law. Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, Scott-King's Modern Europe. In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of Brideshead. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the Forest Lawn cemetery, which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, <b>The</b> <b>Loved</b> One. In 1951 he visited the Holy Land with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes, and in 1953, he travelled to Goa to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest Francis Xavier.|$|E

He asked Perry Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Perry and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when <b>the</b> <b>loved</b> ones began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which {{was seen in the}} US on December 12, 1962, included Como's shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like beard and the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the Twist with the lovely ladies who were part of the visiting dance troupe.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Loved</b> Ones {{were formed}} in Melbourne, Victoria, in October 1965 by Gerry Humphrys (originally from London) on vocals and harmonica, Kim Lynch on bass guitar and Ian Clyne on organ and piano. They were all {{former members of}} a trad jazz group, The Red Onion Jazz Band, in which Humphrys played clarinet, and sang, and Lynch played tuba. Red Onions Jazz Band was {{released}} as an eponymous album in 1964 on W Records blue label. Following the British Invasion, led by the Beatles' tour of Australia in mid-1964, the band split as the three members wanted to switch to R and felt they had drifted towards more mainstream 1940s jazz. <b>The</b> <b>Loved</b> Ones were named after Evelyn Waugh's short and darkly satirical novel <b>The</b> <b>Loved</b> One. To round out the line-up, Humphrys, Lynch and Clyne recruited former Wild Cherries guitarist Rob Lovett. Their first drummer, Terry Nott, was soon followed by Gavin Anderson.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{character}} of Tibullus the historical man is unclear, {{the character}} of his poetic persona is reflected in his works. He was an amiable man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition, loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice (as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messalla to Asia), and apparently constant to his mistresses. His tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients. When treated cruelly by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head. Instead he goes to her little sister’s grave, hung so often with his garlands and wet with his tears, to bemoan his fate. His ideal is a quiet retirement {{in the country with}} <b>the</b> <b>loved</b> one at his side. He has no ambition and not even a poet's yearning for immortality. In an age of crude materialism and gross superstition, he was religious in the old Roman way. His clear, finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him, in the judgment of Quintilian, ahead of other elegiac writers. For natural grace and tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He rarely overloads his lines with Alexandrian learning. However, his range is limited. Tibullus is smoother and more musical, but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. In many of Tibullus's poems a symmetrical composition can be traced.|$|E

500|$|Although Kurtzman {{agreed to}} publish the story, he {{requested}} that Crumb alter the final two panels; the published version depicted Fritz standing next to her. Crumb later recalled that the original ending [...] "wasn't that dirty... only slightly risque by today's standards". In May 1965, Help! published a second Fritz story, [...] "Fred, the Teen-Age Girl Pigeon". In this episode Fritz is a guitar-playing pop idol and he brings Fred, a female pigeon groupie, to his hotel room and proceeds to eat her. John Canaday's New York magazine review of Head Comix describes this punch line as [...] "outrageous brilliance [...] is rivaled only by Evelyn Waugh's last lines in <b>The</b> <b>Loved</b> One." ...|$|E
500|$|Gielgud {{received}} an Oscar nomination for his performance as King Louis VII of France in Becket (1964), with Richard Burton {{in the title}} role. Morley comments, [...] "A minor but flashy role, this had considerable and long-lasting importance; his unrivalled theatrical dignity could greatly enhance a film." [...] In 1964 Gielgud directed Burton in Hamlet on Broadway. Burton's performance received reviews ranging from polite to hostile, but the production was a box-office success, and a film was made of it. Gielgud finally began to take the cinema seriously, for financial and sometimes artistic reasons. He told his agent to accept any reasonable film offers. His films of the mid-1960s were as British expatriate writer Sir Francis Hinsley in Tony Richardson's <b>The</b> <b>Loved</b> One (1965), which Croall termed a disaster despite later acclaim, and Orson Welles's Falstaff film, Chimes at Midnight (1966), which was unsuccessful at the time but has since been recognised as [...] "one of the best, albeit most eccentric, of all Shakespearean movies", according to Morley.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, Steiger {{played an}} effeminate {{embalmer}} in Tony Richardson's comedy <b>The</b> <b>Loved</b> One, about the funeral business in Los Angeles, {{based on the}} 1948 short satirical novel by Evelyn Waugh. His curly-haired appearance in the film was modeled on a bust of Apollo he once saw while meeting Richardson. Steiger offended Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, who found his character repellent. His next role, as Komarovsky, a Russian politician and [...] "villainous opportunist" [...] who rapes Julie Christie's character in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), {{was one of his}} favorites. Steiger, one of only two Americans in the cast, was initially apprehensive about working with such great British actors as Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness, and was pleased when the film was completed that he did not stand out as an American. The film was the biggest international box office draw of the 1960s, grossing $200 million worldwide. It has since been acclaimed {{as one of the greatest}} films ever made, and in 1998 was selected as the 39th best American film in the original AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list by the American Film Institute.|$|E

500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow.

500|$|Rilke {{uses the}} images of love and of lovers {{as a way of}} showing mankind's {{potential}} and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. [...] In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes that [...] "Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air." [...] (Liebende könnten, verstünden sie's, in der Nachtluft / wunderlich reden.) He depicts [...] "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" [...] and contrasts a feminine form of [...] "sublime love" [...] and a masculine [...] "blind animal passion." [...] At the time the first elegies were written, Rilke often [...] "expressed a longing for human companionship and affection, and then, often immediately afterwards, asking whether he could really respond to such companionship if it were offered to him..." [...] He notices a [...] "decline in the lives of lovers... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." [...] Later, during World War I, he would lament that [...] "the world has fallen into the hands of men." [...] In the face of death, life and love is not cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity—that [...] "the nature of every ultimate love... is only able to reach <b>the</b> <b>loved</b> one in the infinite." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Sheen starred {{opposite}} Carey Mulligan in {{the romantic}} drama Far from the Madding Crowd as prosperous bachelor William Boldwood. His performance was well received. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker remarked: [...] "How you prevent such a fellow, crushed {{by his own}} decency, from sagging into a bearded Ashley Wilkes is no easy task, yet Sheen succeeds, and Boldwood's brave smile grows dreadful to behold." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the character [...] "pitiful, and sometimes downright painful to watch. He's not Hardy's Boldwood, but he's a Boldwood. The only sad, genuine moment of the film belongs to him." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked that Sheen's face [...] "is etched with agony and an awful kind of abject adoration, forever {{trying to find ways}} to forgive <b>the</b> <b>loved</b> one in advance for rejection. When Sheen's Boldwood confides to Oak that he feels [...] "grief" [...] you really can feel his pain." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice also referred to the scene where Boldwood expressed his grief, commenting: [...] "Sheen's performance is fine-grained, and the pure Englishness of his understatement is heartrending." [...] Also in 2015, Sheen had well-received comedic television performances in Comedy Bang! Bang!, The Spoils Before Dying and 7 Days in Hell. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said his television host in 7 Days in Hell was [...] "played with damp lechery and cigarette-ash mastery." [...] Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire said he may have [...] "stolen the show" [...] while John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter described him as the [...] "scene-stealer of the bunch." ...|$|E
