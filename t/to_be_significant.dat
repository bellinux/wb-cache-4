5|$|Apples are self-incompatible; {{they must}} cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the {{flowering}} each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees {{are also used}} as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> pollinators.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} {{sympathomimetic}} stimulants there appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> side effects associated with BZP use.

5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant.</b> On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E
5|$|The key {{themes of}} the early Quranic verses {{included}} the responsibility of man towards his creator; {{the resurrection of the}} dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise, and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not killing newborn girls.|$|E

Mims had sold a feature article about the new solid-state device, light-emitting diodes, to Popular Electronics (circulation 400,000) that May. With the hope of selling kits to the larger readership; Roberts and Mims designed a device that would transmit voice over a beam of light, the Opticom. The editors accepted the project story and both articles were featured {{on the cover of the}} November 1970 issue.

5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{practically}} stable 48Ca, the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is 41Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable 41K with a half-life {{of about a}} hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of 41K: traces of 41Ca also still exist today, {{as it is a}} cosmogenic nuclide, continuously reformed through neutron activation of natural 40Ca. Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from 34Ca to 57Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than 41Ca, the most stable among them being 45Ca (half-life 163days) and 47Ca (half-life 4.54days). The isotopes lighter than 42Ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than 44Ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium, although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> decay modes as well.|$|E

5|$|Fighting raged {{throughout}} {{the early morning}} as 'B' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut-off 'D' Company. Varley decided to launch a counterattack with 'A' Company, but at 8:00am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters, cancelling the attack. Covered by the reserve company, 'A' and some of 'B' Company were able to break contact and fall back. 'D' Company, {{along with those of}} 'B' Company that were still isolated and in contact, had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion's lines. By the time they arrived, there were only enough men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing. Japanese losses are unknown, but are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation did not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women {{were more likely to have}} their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality {{regulation}} {{still in use}} in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> {{by the end of}} the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.|$|E

5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significant,</b> but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assess the {{reliability}} and accuracy (validity) of hypothetical binary tasting judgments in an oenological framework. The model that is utilized allows for the control of a wide array of variables that would <b>be</b> exceedingly difficult <b>to</b> fully control in the typical oenological investigation. It is shown that results that <b>are</b> judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> oenologically <b>significant</b> <b>are</b> uniformly judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>significant</b> as well, whether the level of Wine Taster agreement is set at 70 % (Fair); 80 % (Good), or 90 % (Excellent). However, in a number of instances, results that <b>were</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>were</b> not enologically <b>significant</b> by standards that are widely accepted and utilized. This finding is consistent with the bio-statistical fact that given a sufficiently large sample size, even the most trivial of results will prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>significant.</b> Consistent with expectations, multiple patterns of 80 % (Good) and 90 % (Excellent) agreement tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both statistically and enologically significant...|$|R
