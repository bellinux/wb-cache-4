5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and {{a general}} election was called for 3 May. This led to a brief delay in {{the start of the}} <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pamphlet A Tryal of Witches, {{taken from}} a contemporary report of the proceedings, erroneously dates the <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> March 1664, both {{on the front page}} and introduction.

5|$|The rider {{considered}} {{most likely}} to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie Porte (Sky). Porte had already achieved nine race victories in 2015, including the overall victories in Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del Trentino. Porte {{was expected to be}} particularly strong in the individual time <b>trial,</b> <b>as</b> well as in the mountains. Porte had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years, however, and there were doubts about his ability to maintain his form over a three-week race.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> part of the legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony {{that he tried to}} act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first <b>trial,</b> <b>as</b> the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> {{a sign that}} further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted {{as a prelude to}} the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E

5|$|St-Calais {{also ordered}} the {{destruction}} of the old cathedral that had been built by Aldhun, {{to make way for the}} construction of a new, larger cathedral, the current Romanesque-style Durham Cathedral. The construction of the new cathedral began on 29 July 1093, when St-Calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating the site. The first stones were laid shortly afterwards, on 11 August 1093. However, St-Calais' exile after his <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric, and this probably is the cause of the medieval chronicler Symeon of Durham's comparatively neutral treatment of St-Calais in his works. There is no evidence of St-Calais performing any of the normal episcopal functions, including consecrating priests or churches.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Helmand Province {{incident}} was the manslaughter of an injured Taliban insurgent by Alexander Blackman, which occurred on 15 September 2011. Three Royal Marines, known during their <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> Marines A, B, and C, were anonymously tried by court-martial. On 8 November 2013, Marines B and C were acquitted, but Marine A was initially {{found guilty of}} murder of the Afghan combatant, in contravention of section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. This made him the first British soldier to be convicted of a battlefield murder whilst serving abroad since the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The Navy {{set up the}} court-martial in a disused Marine barracks {{building}} at Treasure Island, halfway between Oakland and San Francisco. Reporters from the major and local newspapers were invited to watch the proceedings; Navy public relations officers gave reporters copies of photographs and press statements describing the <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> the first mutiny trial in World War II and the largest mass trial the Navy had ever convened. Chosen to head the seven-man court was Rear Admiral Hugo Wilson Osterhaus, United States Naval Academy, class of 1900. The prosecution team was led by Lieutenant Commander James F. Coakley who had recently served as deputy chief prosecutor in Alameda County under district attorney Earl Warren. Defending the accused men were six Navy lawyers, one {{as leader of the}} team and one attorney for every 10 men. Lieutenant Gerald E. Veltmann headed the defense.|$|E

5|$|The {{completed}} work, {{titled the}} Book of Mormon, {{was published in}} Palmyra on March 26, 1830, by printer E. B. Grandin. Soon after, on April 6, 1830, Smith and his followers formally organized the Church of Christ, and small branches were established in Palmyra, Fayette, and Colesville, New York. The Book of Mormon brought Smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his money-digging and the 1826 Chenango County trial. After Cowdery baptized several new church members, the Mormons received threats of mob violence; before Smith could confirm the newly baptized members, {{he was arrested and}} brought to <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> a disorderly person. He was acquitted, but soon both he and Cowdery fled to Colesville to escape a gathering mob. In probable reference to this period of flight, Smith said that Peter, James, and John had appeared to him and had ordained him and Cowdery to a higher priesthood.|$|E
5|$|The race's only {{individual}} {{time trial}} of an extensive length was held as an out-and-back loop around Villars-les-Dombes in the Ain department. The parcours of the -long stage was almost entirely flat. The stage finished at the Parc des Oiseaux, {{one of the}} largest ornithological parks in Europe. Race organisers had expected the quickest times for the course to be around forty minutes. Several of the general classification leaders regarded the time <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> a test for an individual time trial of similar length due to be held in July, at the Tour de France. As is customary in time trial stages, cyclists set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification {{at the end of the}} previous stage. Thus, Larry Warbasse of the , who was in 172nd place of the 176 starters, trailing overall leader David Veilleux by thirty-five minutes and fourteen seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the case. Gordon received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the <b>trial</b> <b>as</b> shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail. Some claimed that much of the evidence against him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E
