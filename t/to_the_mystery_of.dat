500|$|Writing for The Guardian, Brian Moylan {{compared}} Eaten Alive <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> Al Capone's Vaults—Geraldo Rivera's infamous {{live television}} special that featured the 1986 {{opening of a}} secret vault once owned by Al Capone, which was purported to contain valuable items but ended up only containing debris. Moylan believed that much like the vault, [...] "Rosolie is also {{nothing more than a}} lot of dust and a few empty Coke bottles." [...] However, he did praise the style of the remainder of the special, comparing it to a horror movie and describing it as being [...] "much more dramatic and much better than it needed to be, which is a considerable accomplishment." ...|$|E
500|$|The second commandment {{prohibits the}} use of God's name in vain. Many ancient {{cultures}} believed that names were sacred; some had prohibitions on when a person's name could be spoken. The Gospel of John relates an incident {{where a group of}} Jews attempted to stone Jesus after he used a sacred name of God to refer to himself. They interpreted his statement as a claim of divinity. [...] Since they did not believe that he was God, they considered this blasphemy, which under Mosaic law carries a death penalty. Kreeft writes that all of the names by which God is known are holy, and thus all of those names are protected by the second commandment. The Catechism states, [...] "Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> God himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes." [...] The Catechism also requires respect for the names of people out of respect for the dignity of that person.|$|E

Being introduced as a [...] "tailie", a person on the tail section of the plane, Eko is a mysterious and complex character. MSNBC said the character is [...] "always fighting a battle, an internal struggle {{as to whether the}} life he led was worthy of pride or shame". Portrayer Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained Mr. Eko's dedication to pushing the button in the hatch with seeing the hatch as the answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> life. Described as a [...] "natural leader", Mr. Eko is a [...] "strong, silent type, a man of few words". Jon Bonné of MSNBC said, he is [...] "a dude you don't mess with".

500|$|Gibson {{was first}} {{introduced}} to locative media websites through links from a friend, and initially found the phenomenon to be [...] "excessively nerdy and very conceptual". Despite his finding compelling {{the idea of a}} digital grid mapping the surface of the earth, Gibson saw little storytelling traction in geocaching and geohacking, and instead reworked the material into the locative art of the novel. [...] "When I started, I thought that the 'locative art' stuff would work the way immersion technology did in my earlier fiction", he commented in a subsequent interview. [...] "Then I started liking that it wasn’t going to do that." [...] The conception of the artworks in the novel was derived from the lowbrow art movement, and was inspired by the movement's talismanic Juxtapoz, the only art magazine Gibson was reading regularly at the time. The novel exhibits Gibson's characteristic brand awareness (a key plot element of Pattern Recognition), which he honed while poring over catalogues of products as part of his writing process. The author found the writing process unnerving, as the solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> the container – the novel's MacGuffin – did not come to him until after he had written several hundred pages of manuscript.|$|E

2500|$|As {{suggested}} by the reviewer's reference to a [...] "recent controversy", the Spanish–American War was only recent history when The Mystery of the Sea was published in 1902. The Spanish–American War began in 1897 with America's involvement in the Cuban insurrection against Spain. Cuban revolutionaries had begun fighting Spanish rule in 1895, and Spanish troops were sent to Cuba, where they set up camps known as reconcentrados, meant to contain the rebels. Conditions in these camps were very poor, and they became fodder for [...] "yellow journalism" [...] in the United States, provoking sympathy and outrage {{on behalf of the}} Cubans. Many American politicians supported the idea of going to war, and some even wanted to annex Cuba to the United States. Tensions with Spain intensified upon the publication of a letter from the Spanish minister that insulted President William McKinley, calling him weak. However, the event leading up to the war that caused the greatest public uproar and bears particular significance <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> the Sea was the explosion of the battleship Maine in Havana in 1898. This caused an outpouring of public sentiment against the Spanish, even though the explosion was most likely not the result of a vicious attack. Popular headlines and slogans like [...] "Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain" [...] suggest that the character Marjory's attitude is a representation of the broader American public attitude during the Spanish–American War, and adds significance to her decision to use her fortune to buy a battleship for the U.S. Navy to use against the Spanish.|$|E
