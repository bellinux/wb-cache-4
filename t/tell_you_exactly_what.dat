Bush could have avoided the attacks of September 11, 2001, Ventura answered, [...] "And there it is again, you pay {{attention}} to memos on August 6th that <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> bin Laden's gonna do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Want to {{know how}} to {{discipline}} your school buddy, your math teacher, your cat, and the housefly? How to educate your family members--your little brother, your uncle, your grandma?

Just read the 50+ humorous guidance and playful instructions in this book that will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to do and how to do it. As the author suggests, [...] "When I was a kid, everybody believed that disciplining a child will create miracles. And sometimes it does. This book is about the fact that everything and everyone can be disciplined. (Except, of course, ourselves, because our personality is as sturdy as the icebergs at the North Pole. When I wrote the first instructions on how to discipline our family members, I suddenly realized: I can discipline anyone from a UFO to the police and the ghost in the attic. And I did, with no mercy!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 4, 2009, Ackerman criticized SEC Officials {{over the}} {{handling}} of tips given {{to them about the}} Bernie Madoff scandal. Ackerman believed that he was reflecting the public's opinion, saying: [...] "How are they supposed to have confidence that if somebody goes to you with a complaint—gives it to you on a silver platter with all the investigations, with all the numbers, with all of the data, <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he did, how he did it, and why he did it and how he knows that—and after a period after half a dozen or eight years, you don't know anything?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Michael Flanders makes {{reference}} {{to them in}} the opening patter to the Flanders and Swann song Sounding Brass: [...] "We now turn to number two on your song sheets. Don't strain your eyes trying to read them, though, because I shall be <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> comes next; in any case, these rather fanciful titles that we print on the programmes bear no relation to what we're going to sing. It's a dead waste of a shilling, is what I say. You don't even get green stamps. Well worth collecting, those stamps, my goodness; you know that really is a very nice suit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] Lord Runton continued, [...] "I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> has {{happened}} to-day in my house, {{and to ask}} your advice. May I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{replied the}} boy, blushing. [...] "But now {{is no time}} to talk. Which of you will take the tiller, if I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{its general}} purport; but while I support it patriotically, I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it says. Anyhow, I don't {{see what this}} has to do with the matter." ...|$|E

5000|$|Niko Sylvester of The Electric Playground {{criticized the}} game's linear {{gameplay}} and its controls, {{as well as}} the Kate character, [...] "who <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need to do, even if she's chained to the wall in a dungeon three floors below you. Having Kate around is like having a narrated walkthrough you can't turn off." [...] Sylvester wrote that some of the game's graphics [...] "are quite nice" [...] when viewed from a distance, but stated that a majority of them were [...] "uninspiring at best." [...] Sylvester called the game's music [...] "actually quite good, if occasionally repetitive. ... The other sound effects are occasionally very good, sometimes extremely irritating, but mostly average." [...] Sylvester concluded that Timeline could make a decent family video game to play. Erik Wolpaw of Computer Games Magazine criticized the game's short length of approximately 90 minutes, and wrote that in general, progressing through each level [...] "is a slightly more challenging version of clicking the install program's 'Next' button." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is useless}} {{to ask whether}} you have heard the reports about me," [...] he said; [...] "I know that you have. My purpose to-night is {{to give you some}} {{reasonable}} explanation of the conduct which has produced those reports. My secret has been hitherto confided to one person only; I am now about to trust it to your keeping, with a special object which will appear as I go on. First, however, I must begin by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the great difficulty is which obliges me to be still absent from England. I want your advice and your help; and, to conceal nothing from you, I want also to test your forbearance and your friendly sympathy, before I can venture on thrusting my miserable secret into your keeping. Will you pardon this apparent distrust of your frank and open character--this apparent ingratitude for your kindness toward me ever since we first met?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be alarmed; {{it was my}} duty. I can say no {{more about}} it now, but when it is over I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I said, and why I said it." ...|$|E
6000|$|EDGAR. [Facing him angrily.] No, sir. I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I think.

6000|$|... "Happily, Miss Purcell, {{we are in}} a {{position}} to say that money is no object to us. Hilda is our only child. We have talked it over, of course, and will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we propose, and I hope that you will fall in with the arrangement." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{band had}} {{actually}} broken up, but after Frank Zappa {{expressed interest in}} producing an album for them, they reassembled for one more attempt at success. Recorded in 1976 for MCA Records, this album included a guest performance by Zappa, playing lead guitar on the song [...] "Out to Get You". Although the pairing seemed bizarre, Grand Funk drummer Don Brewer said, [...] "His whole viewpoint on what rock and roll is all about is basically the same as ours.... Keep it {{as simple as possible}} and really bring the balls out of this thing." [...] Zappa said, [...] "All I did was in a documentary way make a record which <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> they really sound like. For the first time on record you can hear Grand Funk Railroad ... and theyre fantastic, fan-tastic with an F three times taller than you!" [...] Grand Funk decided {{on the first day of}} overdubs to split up again, although Zappa stayed until 4 a.m. trying to talk them out of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} me to argue," [...] said Redwood. [...] "I must go to our sons. I want to go to my son. That is why I {{have come}} to <b>you.</b> <b>Tell</b> me <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> offer." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh I'm not {{thinking}} {{so much of}} that. I'm thinking of any that she herself may be still {{in a position to}} pick up. Mine now, don't you see? is in making out how I can manage for this. Of course it's rather difficult," [...] the girl pursued, [...] "for me to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have been}} {{thinking}} hard during the last half‐hour, and I am now going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened on the night I met Miss Harding in Santa Marta,” he said. “I scarcely think you have heard it in quite the same shape before, and I was {{not sure that it}} would have been altogether advisable a little while ago.” ...|$|E
60|$|And now I come to {{the part}} of my story which may seem {{singular}} to you, although I could <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> at least ten things every bit as queer which have {{happened to me in}} my lifetime. You can understand that, to a man who spends his life in scouting and vedette duties on the bloody ground which lies between two great armies, there are many chances of strange experiences. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> however, <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> occurred.|$|R
40|$|Do you {{regularly}} {{suffer from}} headaches, insomnia, stomach upset, constipation, or diarrhea— but can’t {{seem to get}} lasting relief? Have you gone from one doctor to another for nagging or painful “mystery ” symptoms—only to find {{that none of them}} has been able to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what’s</b> wrong, much less come up with an effective treatment? You’re not alone. It is estimated that anywhere from 45 - 60 % of the general population struggles with an extraordinary range of symptoms whose causes can’t be readily identified. 1, 2 You may be one of them. Before you give up altogether, though, take heart: your health “problem ” may not be the problem at all. In reality, your symptoms may be signs that something in your diet is making you feel sick. Unfortunately, identifying which of the many foods you regularly consume may be causing your symptoms, or the specific natural or artificial compound contained in any of those foods, can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. There are as many food allergies and sensitivities as there are symptoms. And until recently, the available detection methods have been rudimentary at best...|$|R
6000|$|Now the editor, {{as often}} as not, begins as a {{mercenary}} and ends as a patriot. This, too, is all {{of a piece with}} human nature. A few years later, if Providence is good, comes the return for judicious investment. Perhaps the town has stood the test of boom, and that which was clapboard is now Milwaukee brick or dressed stone, vile in design but permanent. The shanty hotel is the Something House, with accommodation for two hundred guests. The manager who served you in his shirt-sleeves as his own hotel clerk, is gorgeous in broadcloth, and needs to be reminded of the first meeting. Suburban villas more or less adorn the flats, from which the liveliest fancy (and fancy was free in the early days) hung back. Horse-cars jingle where the prairie schooner used to stick fast in the mud-hole, scooped to that end, opposite the saloon; and there is a Belt Electric Service paying fabulous dividends. Then, do you, feeling older than Methuselah and twice as important, go forth and patronise things in general, while the manager <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> sort of millionaire you would have been if you had 'stayed by the town.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I promised {{my friend}} that I would {{say nothing of}} the matter, and a promise is a promise,' said she; 'but if I can really help her when so serious a charge is laid against her, and when her own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness, then I think I am absolved from my promise. I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} upon Monday evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose I've got {{to support}} you. There seems {{no way out}} of it. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I propose to do. You think my hotel is a pretty poor hotel, eh? Well, you'll have plenty of {{opportunity}} of judging, because you're coming to live here. I'll let you have a suite and I'll let you have your meals, but outside of that--nothing doing! Nothing doing! Do you understand what I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Pettigrew said, Miss Covington, that I {{had better}} {{come to you}} and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I have done. I went down to Tilbury yesterday. I took with me one or two cases made up like a traveler's samples, and I {{presently}} found that the man at the public house by the water had a pony-trap which he let. I went over to him and said that I wanted it for the day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shan't hesitate," [...] the {{midshipman}} said; [...] "but I {{wish the}} fellow {{could make a}} fight of it.

60|$|DR. FREEMANTLE. Which, thank God, it isn't. [He seats {{himself in}} a large easy-chair. The two ladies sit {{side by side on}} a settee.] I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> just <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you've got to expect. A lady--a few years older than the boy himself, but still young. Exquisite figure; dressed--perhaps a trifle too {{regardless}} of expense. Hair--maybe just a shade TOO golden. All that can be altered. Features-- piquant, with expressive eyes, the use of which she probably understands, and an almost permanent smile, displaying an admirably preserved and remarkably even set of teeth. But, above all, clever. That's our sheet-anchor. The woman's clever. She will know how to adapt herself to her new position.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I only mean," [...] Vanderbank explained, [...] "in {{having just}} now blurted my tale out to you. However, I of course do know," [...] he pursued to Mitchy, [...] "that whatever's really between us will remain between us. Let me then <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> myself <b>exactly</b> <b>what's</b> the matter." [...] The {{length of his}} pause after these words showed at last that he had stopped short; on which his companions, as they waited, {{exchanged}} a sympathetic look. They waited another minute, and then he dropped into a chair where, leaning forward, {{his elbows on the}} arms and his gaze attached to the carpet, he drew out the silence. Finally he looked at Mrs. Brook. [...] "YOU make it clear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it will be, but there's {{an unruly}} tribe {{between us and}} the {{territory}} we want, and they're inclined to give trouble." [...] He paused with a meaning smile. [...] "It may be necessary to subjugate them, and, if we enter their country, we'll no doubt find ourselves compelled to move farther north. Something, however, must be left to chance. When one is ready to act, an occasion often presents itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I forgot," [...] she said, {{looking for}} a moment upon the floor; [...] "you have {{probably}} been prejudiced against me. You have heard only one story. Listen"--she raised her eyes suddenly, and leaned a little forward in her chair--"some day, if you will come and see me when I am alone and {{we have time to}} spare, I will tell you the whole truth. I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened! You shall judge for yourself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is simply," [...] he answered, [...] "a {{sheet of}} foolscap. I will not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is written upon it, but it {{contains}} a proposal with reference to raising a certain sum of money, {{to remove from office}} certain prominent politicians who are supporting this Anti-Trust Bill. Our names are all there, Bardsley's, Weiss', Seth Higgins', and my own. Your father's should have been there, but I believe he was too clever for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty laughed. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "you haven't {{tried to}} do {{anything}} of that kind {{for a long while}} now. Anyway, {{it seems to me that}} you knew a good deal about them before you ever saw Major Coulthurst. Of course, it's not my business, but if I were the major I'd make <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were going there for." ...|$|R
60|$|It will {{be remembered}} that at the trial at the police-court two months ago I refused to defend myself. This has been {{referred}} to to-day as a proof of my guilt. I said that it would be some days before I could open my mouth. This was taken at the time as a subterfuge. Well, the days are over, and I am now able to make clear to you not only what took place, but also why it was impossible for me to give any explanation. I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> now <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I did and why it was that I did it. If you, my fellow-countrymen, think that I did wrong, I will make no complaint, but will suffer in silence any penalty which you may impose upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Violet," [...] he said, [...] "you and I--or rather I, for {{you are not}} {{concerned}} in this--live a life {{which is a little}} different from the lives of most of the people around us. The million pay their taxes, and they expect police protection in times of danger. For me there is no such resource. My life has its own splendid compensations. I have weapons with which to fight any ordinary danger. What I want to explain to you is this--that if you hear no more of me, you can do nothing. If that note does not come to you in the morning, you can do nothing. Wait here for three days, and after that go back to England. You will find a letter on your desk, <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> there <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to do." ...|$|R
