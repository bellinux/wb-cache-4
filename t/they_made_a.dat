In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a higher priority on the Wii.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on the 13th, as Waller's army {{approached}} Alton, Crawford fled {{with the}} cavalry to Winchester, leaving Colonel Richardus Boles to defend Alton {{with only the}} infantry. Outnumbered and overpowered, Boles's men were soon forced to seek refuge in the Church of St Lawrence, where <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> desperate last stand. Boles was killed, along with most of his remaining men. The Parliamentarians won a clear victory, losing only a few men and taking many prisoners.|$|E

Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) convinces Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) to move to the caves, because <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> deal that if Charlie found peanut butter, she would move; Charlie shares an imaginary jar of peanut butter with her. Sawyer attempts to burn the letter he wrote, but he finds himself unable to go through with it.|$|E
5|$|Grenville and the G class {{spent the}} bulk of their time before the start of World War II {{assigned}} to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla (DF) in the Mediterranean Fleet, where <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> number of neutrality patrols during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. With the exception of Garland which was under repair at Malta after a premature explosion of her depth charges, they returned home in October–November after {{it became clear that the}} Italians would not enter the war. Hardy and the H-class ships were assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla and joined the Gs in the Mediterranean after commissioning for similar duties.|$|E
5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection. The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots {{in front of it}} before Brčić noticed that it was a hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe. He abandoned the pursuit and proceeded to Šolta.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, former {{warehouse}} {{workers and}} lottery winners Calvin (Calvin Tenner) and Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) approach Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asking for their jobs back as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> bad investment in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. Darryl accepts {{them back and}} shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking pictures at the family portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand.|$|E

Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has no recollection of their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane. Later, in a cryptic conversation, Adam asks Katherine if <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake in moving back, and Katherine reminds him {{that they did not}} have a choice.|$|E

5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> new project (called T65E1) {{based on the}} new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the chassis – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|Since their {{election}} to the Football League in 1894, Leicester have spent much of their history within the top two tiers of English football. Leicester have played outside the top two tiers only once in their history to date; during the 2008–09 season they played in League One, the third tier of English football, after relegation from the Championship the season prior. However, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> swift return to the second tier, as they were promoted as champions in the 2008–09 season. The club have never played lower than England's third tier.|$|E

The aircraft flew separately to Bahrain, where <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> brief refuelling stop, then continued to Ratmalana Airport and Cocos Island where they refuelled again. One of A84-202's tyres burst while landing at Cocos Island, putting {{it out of the}} race. At this time A84-202 was two minutes ahead of A84-201 and 15 minutes ahead of any of the entrants from the Royal Air Force (RAF).|$|E

5|$|The most {{decorated}} Australian Naval unit of World War One, however {{was not a}} ship at all, but the Royal Australian Navy Bridging Train, a land-based unit composed {{mostly of}} reservists which landed at Suvla Bay with the British IX Corps and was responsible for receiving, storing and distributing the supplies, including potable water, of the British troops at Suvla. Due to their position working the piers and landings at Suvla, the Train was the last Australian unit to depart the Gallipoli Peninsula. After Gallipoli, the Train {{was sent to the}} Middle East, where <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> second amphibious landing at the Battle of Magdhaba, before returning to Australia and being disbanded after a series of miscommunications during May 1917.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
