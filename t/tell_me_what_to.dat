500|$|Shaughnessy did {{not take}} {{criticism}} well. In one incident, he demanded that a critical columnist leave a Northern California Football Writers' Association meeting. During a 1945 press conference while coach at Pittsburgh, Shaughnessy responded to criticism {{that he had been}} too conservative in a 6–0 win over [...] and taken too many risks in a 39–9 loss to Notre Dame. He said, [...] "You <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Shall we play a conservative game—hold down the score and play to look good—or shall we gamble, depending on a freak chance to win but losing by a big score if we fail?" ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's {{one of those things where}} the film will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E
500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, [...] "You <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> play and I'll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E

500|$|The opening track, [...] "In My Eyes" [...] {{utilizes}} tingling synths. Colly {{said that}} Robyn is [...] "an encouraging den mother" [...] on the song, singing [...] "Little star, I got you. You'll be okay." [...] Luke O'Neill of The Boston Globe {{said that the}} song showcases [...] "the tension-and-catharsis approach Robyn is capable of achieving with her vocals." [...] The second track, [...] "Include Me Out" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "digitised stop-start funk". The song begins with the line, [...] "It is really very simple, just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval", which according to O'Neill described [...] "the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance-ready songs." [...] On the song, Robyn plays a party-starter that is [...] "repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike" [...] with the line [...] "This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click your heels for me." [...] "Hang with Me", carries a [...] "fierce, club-wrecking beat", with [...] "relentlessly energetic bass" [...] and synth arpeggios. Lyrically, the song speaks of trust in a relationship, with lines such as [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views [...] "the perspective of someone who's a bit too tightly buttoned-up to let her defences down." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Love Kills" [...] was described as a [...] "discofied, sharp-edged" [...] song, with fierce vocals and [...] "haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes." [...] "We Dance to the Beat" [...] is a techno song, with an [...] "apocalyptic, big-beat". It features a [...] "sort of spoken-word hype-up jam" [...] that was compared to [...] "Don't Fucking <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>to</b> Do". The song features lines such as [...] "We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough" [...] and [...] "We dance to the beat of bad kissers clicking teeth." ...|$|E

She ordered Churchill to check on that patient. Churchill responded [...] "You don't need to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do", and then complied with the order. Koch was very upset by this interference. At a meeting the next day with Waters and Stephen Hopper, the hospital's president and chief executive officer, he criticized Waters' conduct and the effect of the cross-training policies.|$|E

2500|$|By mid-year, {{the band}} were being hailed as Australia's leading live act and Borich was widely {{regarded}} as Australia's pre-eminent guitar hero. With Chugg back on board as manager, Kevin was impatient to record a new album. EMI agreed to a new record in September. But the first sessions at EMI's studios were deemed unsatisfactory by the band and all but two tracks were scrapped.

So - I wasn't actually in high school - so my mentality was what - I'm living my own life; I'm a spirited, young woman; I can handle this; I can handle anything.

2500|$|Garbo never married, had no children, {{and lived}} alone as an adult. Her most famous romance {{was with her}} {{frequent}} co-star, John Gilbert, with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927. Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her acting on the set, teaching her how to behave like a star, how to socialize at parties, and {{how to deal with}} studio bosses. They costarred again in three more hits, Love (1927), A Woman of Affairs (1928), and Queen Christina (1933). Gilbert allegedly proposed to her numerous times, with Garbo agreeing but backing out at the last minute. [...] "I was in love with him," [...] she said. [...] "But I froze. I was afraid he would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do and boss me. I always wanted to be the boss." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{was written}} by Al Jean and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. The episode features several other references to popular culture. For example, the song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical West Side Story. The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for The Cable Guy (1996), Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), a model of the RMS Titanic from Titanic (1997), an alien similar to those from Mars Attacks! (1996), models of a TIE fighter, an X-wing fighter and C-3PO from the Star Wars saga, as well as [...] "the coffee mug" [...] from the film Heartbeeps (1981) and [...] "the cane" [...] from Citizen Kane (1941), which is not a real prop. [...] "Citizen Kane" [...] is also referenced in the script with the line [...] "People will think what I tell them to think when you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> tell them to think!"
