2500|$|On 10 June 2009 Rotana {{released}} Najwa's 18th album, entitled [...] "Khallini Shoufak" [...] (Let me see you). It {{has been}} deemed {{a very strong}} release from Shams El Ghenniyie, Najwa Karam. The album contains 8 songs, each with a different style of music and catchy lyrics. It is worth mentioning that along with the lead single [...] "Khallini Shufak", three other songs are receiving huge success: [...] "Eidak" [...] (your hand), [...] "Allah Yesghello Balo" [...] (may God make him worry), and [...] "Aboos Eynak" [...] (kiss your eye). The remaining songs are: [...] "Wale'"(light the fire), [...] "El Deni Em" [...] (a mother is the whole world), [...] "Albi Masna' Baroud" [...] (my heart is a gun factory), [...] "El Haramy" [...] (the <b>thieve).</b> The album {{is considered to be}} Najwa's strongest return to her original style since [...] "Saharny" [...] (2003). Najwa said, [...] "it's full of folkloric, balady songs, similar to Saharny and her 90's releases". Her video for [...] "Khallini Shoufak" [...] was released around the same time as her CD.|$|E
2500|$|Within the churchyard, to the {{south-west}} of the tower, is a stone {{marker for}} {{the grave of}} Henry Trigg. Trigg was the Berden parish constable {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, and ran a shoe shop adjacent to Berden Hall in the village. On the night of 25 March 1814 two men from Bishops Stortford, a William Pratt and a Thomas Turner, broke into Trigg's shop to <b>thieve</b> leather goods. They were confronted by Trigg and his father. Trigg offered defence by disabling Turner, but after a Pratt attempt to shoot Trigg’s father with a double-barrelled gun, both father and son made to escape. Pratt, using the words [...] "Now, damn your heart, I will do for you", then shot Trigg in the chest, killing him. A year later Pratt and Turner were captured by the Bow Street Runners, sentenced to death, and sent to the gallows. The words [...] "In memory of Henry Trigg of this Parish Aged 36 years Who was murdered March 25th 1814 endeavouring to protect his property" [...] were recorded as written on the tombstone. Following the execution of Pratt and Turner, a postscript was reportedly added to Trigg’s stone: [...] "March 13th 1815 Wm Pratt, Thos Turner Both of Bishops Stortford, Herts. Were executed at Chelmsford for the above offence on their own confession".|$|E

6000|$|So that I {{think that}} even if the creeds, from the {{so-called}} [...] "Apostles'" [...] to the so-called [...] "Athanasian," [...] were swept into oblivion; and even if the human race should arrive at the conclusion that, whether a bishop washes a cup or leaves it unwashed, {{is not a matter of}} the least consequence, it will get on very well. The causes which have led to the development of morality in mankind, which have guided or {456} impelled us all the way from the savage to the civilised state, will not cease to operate because a number of ecclesiastical hypotheses turn out to be baseless. And, even if the absurd notion that morality is more the child of speculation than of practical necessity and inherited instinct, had any foundation; if all the world is going to <b>thieve,</b> murder, and otherwise misconduct itself as soon as it discovers that certain portions of ancient history are mythical; what is the relevance of such arguments to any one who holds by the Agnostic principle? ...|$|E
