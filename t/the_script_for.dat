5|$|An early {{draft of}} the {{screenplay}} was written by Chris Conkling, who told {{the bulk of the}} story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view. After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author Peter S. Beagle was called in for a rewrite. According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of <b>the</b> <b>script</b> <b>for</b> only $5,000, on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative. Ironically, <b>the</b> <b>script</b> <b>for</b> Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E

5|$|Filming for The Terminator was set {{to begin}} in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when {{producer}} Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract {{that would make him}} unavailable for nine months while he was filming Conan the Destroyer.

5|$|McDiarmid {{noticed that}} <b>the</b> <b>script</b> <b>for</b> Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his {{character}} {{than in previous}} films. Lightsaber combat was {{a challenge to the}} 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.|$|E
5|$|Scott Bakula {{stated in}} an {{interview}} on The Wayne Brady Show that there were three endings to the episode filmed.

Bakula explained later during an online chat for the official Star Trek website that only one ending was ever filmed.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>script</b> <b>for</b> Frank's Cock {{has been}} {{published}} several times, including in the script anthology By the Skin of Their Tongues and in the Journal of Film and Video (both 1997).

5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's {{draft was}} too much of a {{morality}} play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote <b>the</b> <b>script</b> <b>for</b> Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed to work on <b>the</b> <b>script</b> <b>for</b> three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome.|$|E
