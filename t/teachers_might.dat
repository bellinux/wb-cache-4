25|$|There is no {{surviving}} {{record for}} {{the early years of}} Dioscorus. His father Apollos was an entrepreneur and local official. The commonly accepted date for the birth of Dioscorus is around A.D. 520. Although there is no evidence, it is likely that Dioscorus went to school in Alexandria, where one of his <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> have been the Neoplatonic philosopher John Philoponus. Although Alexandria was not the most prominent place for a legal education – that was the city of Beirut – young men did travel there for rhetorical training preliminary to the study of law. These included the celebrated poet Agathias, a contemporary of Dioscorus, who at an early age published a successful collection of poems called the Cycle and later became the center of a circle of prominent poets in Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|All {{universities}} {{suffered from}} lack of resources but some of {{this was due to}} corruption. In 2009/10, AAU staff thought nepotism, patronage and abuse of resources was widespread. They noted that the number of administrators driving expensive cars around campus had increased. Inadequate planning from both government and universities allowed resource abuse to occur. Corruption was encouraged by social recognition for wealth and power rather than academic excellence. Some professors were opening private colleges and advising their students to attend them. Teachers were often absent from class and moonlighting to make up for poor pay. <b>Teachers</b> <b>might</b> award marks based on favoritism or ethnic and religious relationships. In on case, a female student reported an administrator for demanding sexual favors in exchange for passing her grade to the registrar. The administration could change a fail to a pass at the student's request. Corruption and lack of transparency were also observed at MU.|$|E
2500|$|The World Bank {{survey of}} 80 {{teachers}} found that 80% reported general dissatisfaction with procedures for up-grading with 50% considering it {{was influenced by}} political connections and 27% by relationships to committee members. Bribery was mentioned by 9%. Application of rules and regulations could be {{at the discretion of}} key decision makers and favouritism was unchallenged. Teachers' absenteeism was tolerated to allow private tutoring which was reported by 40% of school officials. Promotion was seen as unrelated to merit and could involve forged documentation, possibly supported by officials who failed to notice forgeries. [...] There were some reports of corruption in student assessment such as staff changing marks, favouring their relatives and selectively leaking questions. Fraudulent practices in examinations included forged admission cards, to allow students to pay others to take their exam, and collusion in cheating between students and school officials. In one case, regional officials were alleged to have over-turned a disqualification. <b>Teachers</b> <b>might</b> also accept bribes from students or parents to over-score the examination. Falsification of documents was widespread with most occurring for completion of the primary or secondary school cycle. There could be corruption in the building of new educational facilities, particularly in remote areas which were difficult to supervise. Corruption was indicated when a building collapsed but no one was held to account and there was no investigation. Bribery was regarded as worse than favouritism or document falsification. Expressing gratitude with a small gift was not considered corrupt. Malpractice tended not to be reported for fear of reprisals. Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and general knowledge of pupil entitlement helped to reduce some sources of potential corruption.|$|E
60|$|If {{the boys}} should appear not much {{interested}} in the proposal, the <b>teacher</b> <b>might,</b> at his own discretion, waive it. In all probability, however, they would like it, and would indicate their interest by their countenances, or perhaps by a response. If so, the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> proceed.|$|R
5000|$|The local river {{system would}} be the unifying idea, but the English teacher would link it to Language Arts by {{studying}} river vocabulary and teaching students {{how to do a}} research report. The science <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> teach children about the life systems that exist in the river, while the Social Studies <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> help students research the local history and peoples who used the river for food and transport.|$|R
50|$|The {{teacher is}} {{a guide to}} {{scaffolding}} students’ learning in several ways throughout in the LGL strategy. First, the teacher asks students to recall words and phrases {{that are associated with}} the given concept. Then, the teacher writes and reads the list of words generated, modeling the appropriate spelling and pronunciation. The <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> also call attention to features of given words, such as root words or prefixes/suffixes, or to clarify a word’s meaning. Finally, the teacher facilitates discussion of the relationships between the words and phrases as students group the words. The <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> also, in later use, add in some confusing terms for the students to discover. If the students are unable to see how these newly introduced words fit, the teacher can use this information to assess what needs additional instruction and what the students are comfortable with. When first introducing the LGL strategy to students, the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> model the process or parts of the process to scaffold students’ understanding. For instance, the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> have a list of words regarding another topic, form a group from the list, and label the group, telling why s/he chose that label.|$|R
60|$|All of {{the boys}} {{knew that it would}} not do to try any more hazing for the next few nights. Even if the guards gave no alarm, Captain Putnam or one of the <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> be on the watch to catch them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a bit, {{especially}} {{at this time}} of year, when nobody wants me in the evenings. My only doubt is whether it is not keeping the girls out too late, but I will see whether it can be managed. The children might be better taught, and the <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> learn something themselves in this indirect way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! The usual story! I want no such lame excuses! Some <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> accept them, but not I! Go to your rooms, and at once,--and don't dare to come downstairs until to-morrow morning--or I'll cut off {{all your}} {{holidays}} until Christmas!" [...] And Job Haskers folded his arms and stood like a judge before the boys.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now Jerry!" [...] {{she called}} sharply, as a singing <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> call, so that Jerry {{turned his head}} in attention, looked at her, smiled {{understanding}} with his eyes, and waited.|$|R
30|$|For example, a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> draw {{an object}} in a {{horizontal}} layout when the instruction target is to sort an array, whereas the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> draw the array in a vertical layout for a stack. Changes in visualization policy such as this are derived by fitting the instruction content to the learners’ background knowledge. For example, if the learners sufficiently understand a stack, drawing either object in a horizontal or vertical layout would be acceptable to the learners. Similarly, the teacher would not need to draw the temporary variable in a task that swaps the values of two variables for non-novice learners.|$|R
50|$|This theory, however, was criticised by Pierre Thillet in 1984. Thillet {{argued that}} the text that refers to Aristotle as Alexander's <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> merely mean that Alexander learned from the {{writings}} of the famous Aristotle.|$|R
6000|$|The {{windowless}} {{backs of}} houses built in this garden, {{and in particular}} the whole of one side, was skirted by the rear of a long line of premises--being the boarding-houses of the neighbouring college. This rear, however, was all blank stone, with the exception of certain attic loopholes high up, opening from the sleeping-rooms of the women-servants, and also one casement in a lower story said to mark the chamber or study of a master. But, though thus secure, an alley, which ran parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden, was forbidden to be entered by the pupils. It was called indeed [...] "l'allée défendue," [...] and any girl setting foot there would have rendered herself liable to as severe a penalty as the mild rules of Madame Beck's establishment permitted. <b>Teachers</b> <b>might</b> indeed go there with impunity; but as the walk was narrow, and the neglected shrubs were grown very thick and close on each side, weaving overhead a roof of branch and leaf which the sun's rays penetrated but in rare chequers, this alley was seldom entered even during day, and after dusk was carefully shunned.|$|E
5000|$|Interdisciplinary {{teaching}} is a method, {{or set of}} methods, used to teach a unit across different curricular disciplines. For example, the seventh grade Language Arts, Science and Social Studies <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> work together to form an interdisciplinary unit on rivers.|$|E
50|$|Improvisation {{is used in}} {{educational}} music in a few settings. <b>Teachers</b> <b>might</b> make up a song for times tables and teach it to the students, perhaps having students add parts. Some people also make up songs to remember things or to study for a test.|$|E
40|$|One {{summarizing}} strategy {{developed by}} Brown, Campione, and Day (1981) {{is referred to}} as a rule-based summary strategy. It has been tested with students of various ages. The rules in the strategy are as follows: Delete trivial material that is unnecessary to understanding; Delete redundant material; Substitute superordinate terms for lists (e. g., “flowers ” for “daisies, tulips, and roses”); and Select a topic sentence, or invent one if it is missing. To make these rules “come alive ” for students, a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> initially demonstrate them in some detail. For example, the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> present students with a passage such as the one i...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I--er----" [...] stammered Gus. [...] "I--that is----" [...] He did {{not know}} how to proceed. He did not dare deny his guilt, not knowing but what the {{assistant}} <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> have seen him and his crony light the tar-barrels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you expect}} us to study in a cold room?" [...] {{questioned}} Jack. He had thrown {{one of the small}} bed covers over the radiator and added a book or two so that the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> not notice that it was warm.|$|R
5000|$|Social Control: Importance of {{avenues of}} {{effective}} countercontrol since institutions {{of social control}} such as religion, government, and education rely heavily on aversive control. These avenues will be available if control is conspicuous {{and if there is}} a balance between control and countercontrol. Understanding countercontrol in a classroom setting and implementing cooperation among students and <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> be helpful to the classroom environment and countercontrol may help in understanding chronic behavior problems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} of a teacher co-op could vary from, [...] "...handling the whole school which involves {{the teachers in the}} administration and management of the school {{as well as in the}} learning. Alternatively, teachers in a large secondary school—while continuing to be district employees—could form a partnership to handle the math department, the science department or the English department. They could then focus on learning; the principal would handle the school administration. A partnership of <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> also organize to take responsibility for a program serving several schools across a district; Montessori, for example." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{names of}} the former {{students}} claiming to be sexually abused have been withheld from the public, but the public was told {{that many of them}} were notable scientists or held political or economic positions of power. It was also revealed that some of the alumni who had been abused decided {{to send their children to}} the Canisius-Kolleg. One of the teachers has spoken out and said the allegations made against him were true, because he really had abused boys. The <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> not be sued for what they did, because it seems that in most cases the statute of limitations has passed, but the abused boys want them to apologize.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry, but you shouldn't sprawl {{all over}} with your feet," [...] {{answered}} the youngest Rover coldly, and passed on to his seat. When he looked back, Larkspur, watching his chance so that no <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> see him, shook his fist at Sam.|$|R
5000|$|Integration: {{students}} summarize {{what they}} have learned and commit it to memory. The teacher may give the students an overview of everything they have learned. It is important that the teacher not present any new material during this phase, but only a summary of what has already been learned. The <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> also give an assignment to remember the principles and vocabulary learned for future work, possibly through further exercises. (A <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> say, [...] "Here is a summary of what we have learned. Write this in your notebook and do these exercises for homework.") Supporters of the van Hiele model point out that traditional instruction often involves only this last phase, which explains why students do not master the material.|$|R
50|$|Because most block {{teachers}} have three classes per quarter, {{they are working}} with 75 +/- students per grading period versus the 150+/- that a traditional <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> work with at any given time. This allows for {{a very high level}} of personalization and enhances the teacher's ability to track progress and learning styles of individual students.|$|R
50|$|Later in his {{teaching}} career, Sri ANNA {{began to use}} the Gandhian method of punishment. One day a boy broke an object. ANNA did not know who had broken it, and when he asked no one came forward {{to admit that they}} had done it. Instead of punishing everyone, as some <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> have done to induce the guilty person to come forward, ANNA fasted until the boy confessed. Because the boy could not bear to see ANNA fasting on his behalf, the very next day he admitted to ANNA what he had done. Upon hearing this, ANNA kindly corrected him and started eating again. He felt that this punishment was much more effective than the ordinary one.|$|E

5000|$|Undoubtedly {{the most}} famous teacher at Matsuyama Middle School was Natsume Kinnosuke, better known as Natsume Sōseki, who arrived in 1895 and taught for only a year, but later memorialized the {{experience}} in one of Japan's most popular novels, Botchan (1906). Botchan describes the comically unfortunate experiences of a young teacher fresh from Tokyo (called, euphemistically, [...] "Botchan" [...] or [...] "little master") as he attempts, with little enthusiasm or success, {{to adapt to the}} academic regime and the local culture. In the novel, Botchan's colleagues are given comical names such as Tanuki (Raccoon-dog), Akashatsu (Red-shirt), etc., prompting continued speculation as to which of Sōseki's fellow <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> have been their real-life models.|$|E
30|$|Why {{might we}} expect that {{referring}} to linked representations with gesture is beneficial for students’ learning? One clue comes from evidence about the types of gestures that teachers commonly use. Naturalistic studies have documented that teachers use a range {{of different types of}} gestures during instruction. Teachers frequently use pointing gestures to guide students’ attention to important features of the instructional context, such as key features of inscriptions (e.g., graphs, equations, or diagrams) that are written on the board (Alibali, Nathan, & Fujimori, 2011). Such gestures might facilitate students’ noticing and encoding the referents of those points. Teachers also regularly use pointing gestures when linking ideas. Sets of points can be used to highlight corresponding aspects of multiple representations, and in this way, to express information about relationships among ideas. For example, a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> point to the y-intercept of a linear equation, and then point to the corresponding y-intercept on the associated graph, or a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> point out the term that indicates slope in one equation, and then point out the corresponding term in a second equation. Pointing gestures can also clarify the referents of the accompanying speech, so they may contribute to students’ comprehension of links that are expressed verbally. For example, a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> say, “the y-axis represents the amount of money saved,” while pointing to the y-axis of the graph. In this case, her pointing gesture can clarify the referent of the term “y-axis” for students who are unsure.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the more}} {{important}} decisions a law teacher makes when preparing a new course is what materials to assign. Criminal procedure teachers are spoiled for choice, with legal publishers offering several options written by teams of renowned scholars. This Article considers how a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> choose from the myriad options available and suggests two potentially overlooked criteria: weight and price...|$|R
500|$|Moreover, {{the student}} must have good instructors, who emphasise reason over rhetoric. Russell {{indicates}} that the critical mind is an essential feature of the healthy citizen of a democracy, since collective hysteria {{is one of the}} greatest threats to democracy (Russell 1938:248). To foster a critical mind, he suggests, the teacher ought to show the students the consequences of pursuing one's feelings over one's thoughts. For example, the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> allow students to choose a field trip between two different locations: one fantastic place which is given a dull overview, and a shabby place which is recommended by impressive advertisements. In teaching history, the <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> examine a particular event from a multitude of different perspectives, and allow the students to use their critical faculties to make assessments of each. (Russell 1938:247) In all cases, the object would be to encourage self-growth, a willingness to be [...] "tentative in judgment", and [...] "responsiveness to evidence". (Russell 1938:250) ...|$|R
50|$|Later, {{during the}} 1987-8 school year, three organizations, {{including}} members of the Alaska Native community, “initiated a process to establish an Alaska Native Language Policy for schools in Alaska,” which “states that schools {{have a responsibility to}} teach and use as the medium of instruction the Alaska Native language of the local community to the extent desired by the parents of that community”. This proposal for the Alaska Native Language Policy comes three years after Steven A. Jacobson’s “Central Yup'ik and the Schools: A Handbook for Teachers,” a guide for teachers which exemplifies differences and similarities between English and Yup’ik so that Yup’ik or English-speaking <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> successfully engage English-speaking Eskimo Yup’ik students in a “bilingual-bicultural education” that teaches their native language.|$|E

5000|$|Moreover, the {{expressive}} view which {{is represented in}} Donald Murray's article [...] "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product", allows for wittier creating and freer movement. It suggests three elements for [...] "good" [...] writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, {{it is difficult to}} evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess [...] "good" [...] writing. ESL <b>teachers</b> <b>might</b> use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they do not have any vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach.|$|E
50|$|Philosophy of {{education}} {{can also be}} understood not as an academic discipline but as a normative educational theory that unifies pedagogy, curriculum, learning theory, and the purpose {{of education}} and is grounded in specific metaphysical, epistemological, and axiological assumptions. These theories are also called educational philosophies. For example, a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> be said to follow a perennialist educational philosophy or to follow a perennialist philosophy of education.|$|R
5000|$|Information or inquiry: {{students}} get {{acquainted with the}} material and begin to discover its structure. Teachers present a new idea and allow the students {{to work with the}} new concept. By having students experience the structure of the new concept in a similar way, they can have meaningful conversations about it. (A <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> say, [...] "This is a rhombus. Construct some more rhombi on your paper.") ...|$|R
25|$|Students are not {{the only}} ones to cheat in an {{academic}} setting. A study among North Carolina school teachers found that some 35% of respondents said they had witnessed their colleagues cheating in one form or another. The rise of high-stakes testing and the consequences of the results on the teacher is cited as a reason why a <b>teacher</b> <b>might</b> want to inflate the results of their students.|$|R
