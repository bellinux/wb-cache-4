40|$|Introduction: Crotoxin has a broad {{antitumor}} activity but {{has shown}} frequent neurotoxic toxicity. To induce tolerance and limit this toxicity, we propose a new design with intra-patient dose escalation. Methods: A new Dose Limiting Toxicity definition was used. The concept of <b>Target</b> <b>Ceiling</b> Dose was introduced. Results: Dose Limiting Toxicity was {{the inability to}} dose escalate twice. <b>Target</b> <b>Ceiling</b> Dose was the highest planned dose to be administered to a patient and could change for patients along time. Recommended Dose was defined similarly as in a (3  +  3) conventional design. Conclusion: This innovant design was used and the clinical trial is now closed for inclusions. Results will be presented later...|$|E
40|$|Inflation {{expectations}} are key unobservable variables for decision-making, especially in managing monetary policy. Understand how to formulate them, {{if they are}} rational or adaptive is vital. This study answers these questions through a panel data analysis of the micro data from the inflation expectation survey of the Central Bank of Uruguay. The main findings indicate: i) a low predictive power of the analysts surveyed in the 12 -month horizon; ii) a convergence of the individual forecasts to the released monthly median iii) an overweight of the inflation <b>target</b> <b>ceiling</b> and {{the dynamics of the}} inflation, and iv) a underweight of monetary policy instruments. With respect to the evidence of rationality, we find the partial use of available information and in some cases, there is a systematic bias. ...|$|E
30|$|The logjam was {{recently}} broken at the 21 st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris in late 2015, where 195 countries offered pledges intended to reduce GHG emissions {{so as to}} avoid global mean temperatures more than 2 °C beyond preindustrial levels. These Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) represented a bottom-up approach to the negotiations (Rayner 2010) in that each country dictated its own level of GHG mitigation (UNFCCC 2016). Ironically, many developing countries (for example, Brazil with a 41 % reduction and Mexico with a 25 % reduction) departed from their earlier positions by offering pledges at the level of many industrialized countries. Rose et al. (2017, 2018) make the point that developing countries may have “pledger’s remorse” once they begin comparing their own promised contribution with those of other countries. Moreover, scientists suggest that the 2 °C <b>target</b> (<b>ceiling)</b> is inadequate to avoid major damages from climate change, and recommend a 1.5 °C target. Bretschger (2016) and others see equity principles returning as a major consideration in negotiations to strengthen the target.|$|E

The Pandavas enter the {{competition}} in disguise as Brahmins. The task is to string a mighty steel bow and shoot a <b>target</b> on the <b>ceiling,</b> which is the eye of a moving artificial fish, while looking at its reflection in oil below. Most of the princes fail, many being unable to lift the bow. Arjuna succeeds however. The Pandavas return home and inform their mother that Arjuna has won a competition and to look at what they have brought back. Without looking, Kunti asks them to share whatever it is Arjuna has won among themselves. On explaining the previous life of Draupadi, she ends up being the wife of all five brothers.|$|R
40|$|For any organisation, saving on {{procurement}} costs {{has an impact}} on profitability that is multiplied by gross margin. Although much research focus has been placed on achieving the lowest possible cost for the goods/services purchased we concern ourselves here with the operational {{procurement costs}} of the organisation. The AutONA (Automated One-to-one Negotiation Agent) system was conceived as a means of reducing these operational procurement costs enabling procurement departments to automate as much price negotiation as possible thus creating the option of reducing direct costs and/or redeployment of operational effort into strategic procurement requiring high human involvement. The problem domain has been limited to the automation of multiple 1 : 1 negotiations over price for quantities of a substitutable good subject to the organisation's procurement constraints of <b>target</b> quantity, price <b>ceiling</b> and deadline. We present the design of the core reasoning system and preliminary results obtained from a number of experiments conducted in HP's Experimental Economics Lab. Our main conclusion is that AutONA could reasonably be deployed for automated negotiation having shown no evidence for being identified as an automated system by suppliers...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{stringent}} temperature targets, active removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere may be required in the long run. Such negative emissions can be materialized when well-performing bioenergy systems are combined with {{carbon capture and storage}} (BECCS). Here, we develop an integrated global energy system and climate model to evaluate the role of BECCS in reaching ambitious temperature targets. We present emission, concentration and temperature pathways towards 1. 5 and 2 degrees C targets. Our model results demonstrate that BECCS makes it feasible to reach temperature targets that are otherwise out of reach, provided that a temporary overshoot of the target is accepted. Additionally, stringent temperature targets can be met at considerably lower cost if BECCS is available. However, the economic benefit of BECCS nearly vanishes if an overshoot of the temperature target is not allowed. Finally, the least-cost emission pathway over the next 50 years towards a 1. 5 degrees C overshoot target with BECCS is almost identical to a pathway leading to a 2 degrees C <b>ceiling</b> <b>target...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, most {{financial assets}} in formal markets are deposits at financial institutions. This potentially important tax base could be taxed {{at a low}} administrative cost. When revenues of financial taxes are significant, implicit taxes dwarf explicit taxes. The author focuses on the implicit taxation of financial assets through seigniorage, reserve requirements, lending <b>targets,</b> and interest <b>ceilings</b> combined with inflation. The last instrument has often been overlooked, but it has generated {{more than a third}} of implicit revenues in some cases by lowering the cost of government borrowing. Tax revenues are difficult to measure because of regulations that prevent the use of market prices for computation and distort the meaning of some definitions. For some countries, the standard method of seigniorage grossly underestimates the revenue from financial taxation. The author discusses various sources of distortion but ignores potential impacts on the level of saving and the growth rate. Although taxes on financial assets have a low administrative cost, the excess burden that stems from the misallocation of resources is probably a much higher fraction of revenues than that of other taxes.

40|$|Diesel NOx {{emissions}} {{have been}} at the forefront of research and regulation scrutiny as a result of failures of late vehicle technologies to deliver on-road emissions reductions. The current study aims at identifying the actual emissions levels of late light duty vehicle technologies, including Euro 5 and Euro 6 ones. Mean NOx emission factor levels used in the most popular EU vehicle emission models (COPERT, HBEFA and VERSIT+) are compared with latest emission information collected in the laboratory over real-world driving cycles and on the road using portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS). The comparison shows that Euro 5 passenger car (PC) emission factors well reflect on road levels and that recently revealed emissions control failures do not call for any significant corrections. However Euro 5 light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and Euro 6 PCs in the 2014 – 2016 period exhibit on road emission levels twice as high as used in current models. Moreover, measured levels vary a lot for Euro 6 vehicles. Scenarios for future evolution of Euro 6 emission factors, reflecting different degree of effectiveness of emissions control regulations, show that total NOx emissions from diesel Euro 6 PC and LCV may correspond from 49 % up to 83 % of total road transport emissions in 2050. Unless upcoming and long term regulations make sure that light duty diesel NOx emissions are effectively addressed, this will have significant implications in meeting future air quality and national emissions <b>ceilings</b> <b>targets.</b> © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{translational}} research developments in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), outcome measure design and demands from regulatory authorities require that clinical outcome assessments are 'fit for purpose'. An international collaboration (SMA REACH UK, Italian SMA Network and PNCRN USA) undertook an iterative process to address discontinuity in the recorded {{performance of the}} Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded and developed a revised functional scale using Rasch analysis, traditional psychometric techniques {{and the application of}} clinical sensibility via expert panels. Specifically, we intended to develop a psychometrically and clinically robust functional clinician rated outcome measure to assess physical abilities in weak SMA type 2 through to strong ambulant SMA type 3 patients. The final scale, the Revised Hammersmith Scale (RHS) for SMA, consisting of 36 items and two timed tests, was piloted in 138 patients with type 2 and 3 SMA in an observational cross-sectional multi-centre study across the three national networks. Rasch analysis demonstrated very good fit of all 36 items to the construct of motor performance, good reliability with a high Person Separation Index PSI 0. 98, logical and hierarchical scoring in 27 / 36 items and excellent <b>targeting</b> with minimal <b>ceiling.</b> The RHS differentiated between clinically different groups: SMA type, World Health Organisation (WHO) categories, ambulatory status, and SMA type combined with ambulatory status (all p < 0. 001). Construct and concurrent validity was also confirmed with a strong significant positive correlation with the WHO motor milestones rs = 0. 860, p < 0. 001. We conclude that the RHS is a psychometrically sound and versatile clinical outcome assessment to test the broad range of physical abilities of patients with type 2 and 3 SMA. Further longitudinal testing of the scale with regards change in scores over 6 and 12 months are required prior to its adoption in clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 - 15 years {{there has been}} {{increasing}} concern within Europe as to the effects of ammonia emission and subsequent deposition to sensitive ecosystems, causing eutrophication and soil acidification. Transboundary transport of emissions has led to legislation at EC level with member states being given emission <b>ceiling</b> <b>targets.</b> Research has therefore aimed at quantifying national emissions, modelling emission processes and developing mitigation strategies. Agriculture accounts for > 80 % of total UK ammonia emission, therefore an accurate and robust model is required to estimate emissions from this sector. National inventory methodology has improved as the database of emission measurements and survey data has grown and as models have evolved from discrete empirical calculations for individual sources to linked nitrogen flow models incorporating more process-based algorithms. Ammonia emissions from agriculture derive mainly from livestock manures (primarily from the urea content of urine) and land application of manures represents a major emission source. Research in this area has therefore aimed to improve our ability to predict losses, taking into account the major influencing factors, in order to improve inventory estimates, improve manure management decision support models for farmers and advisers and to highlight potential mitigation strategies. This requires the ability to make precise, accurate measurements and measurement technology has been developed for a range of scales. A key factor influencing ammonia emissions following applications of livestock slurries to soil is the rate and extent to which slurry infiltrates into the soil, where it will be largely protected from volatilisation. This has not previously been fully incorporated into process-based models and research presented here has provided a mechanism describing the infitration process in which the slurry dry matter concentration and the nature of that dry matter are among the important influencing factors. Measures aimed at reducing emissions from land spreading are generally regarded as the most cost-effective means of reducing emissions from agriculture. A number of slurry application techniques aimed at reducing emissions have been developed and assessed against the conventional method of surface broadcasting. These new techniques rely on either reducing the exposed slurry surface area from which emission occurs, reducing the air flow and temperature at the emitting surface (thereby increasing the resistance to ammonia transport from the emitting surface to the free atmosphere) or increasing the contact between slurry and soil. A more holistic approach to reducing emissions is via dietary manipulation, with the aim of reducing both the amount and form of nitrogen excreted by livestock. This can result in lower ammonia emissions at all stages of manure management i. e. livestock housing, manure storage and application to land.
