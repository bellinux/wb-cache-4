5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space. Another man stands, echoing and {{opposing}} the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E

5|$|Light {{falls on}} <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space from the left, {{creating}} shadows {{against the back}} wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
50|$|Owing {{to the new}} size of <b>the</b> <b>pictorials,</b> <b>the</b> National Banknote company {{embossed}} {{them with}} a smaller grill pattern—- the so-called G-Grill—- than had been used on the previous series. The G-Grill is found only on this 1869 issue.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} a sample of Italian users comprehended safety pictorials used on agricultural machinery. A questionnaire with 12 safety pictorials was administered to 248 users of agricultural machinery. For each of <b>the</b> <b>pictorials,</b> <b>the</b> participants were asked to select the most appropriate description of four written choices. <b>The</b> investigated safety <b>pictorials</b> were, in general, not well comprehended. Two different classes of participants were identified, each with a different level of comprehension. The participants with better comprehension were characterized by the regular use of agricultural machinery and frequent previous exposure to <b>pictorials.</b> <b>The</b> need for training courses focusing on safety pictorials and their meanings, as well as the need for improvement to <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> themselves to make them more easily comprehended, is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Quite different, however, was <b>the</b> {{reception}} <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> {{faced in}} <b>the</b> months after their release during 1869. Early philatelic reviews were favorable, but soon severe criticism {{began to appear}} in the press, and the stamps rapidly became disreputable. As early as September, newspapers announced that the Post Office was planning a new definitive issue to supplant the unpopular series, and the replacements went on sale during April, 1870— less than thirteen months after <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> had first been vended. The new issue cost the taxpayer nothing, for the National Banknote Company's contract for U.S. stamp production required it to furnish—- as the Postmaster stated in a written report—- [...] "new designs and plates ... at the pleasure of the Postmaster General, without additional cost to the department". The remarkably brief tenure of <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> meant that relatively few stamps could be printed, which accounts for their present scarcity.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel {{has five}} windows, of which four date from 1325–30 and include {{images of a}} local saint, Dunstan. The east window was {{restored}} to a semblance of its original appearance by Thomas Willement in 1845. The other windows have complete canopies, but <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> sections are fragmented.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pictorial</b> {{composition}} of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} the comprehensibility of aviation safety pictorials that compose specific pictograms. A total of 120 individuals {{were asked to}} provide detailed responses to each pictorial that comprised a pictogram. The seven categories of pictograms were: (a) take-off, landing, and surface movement; (b) oxygen; (c) in flight; (d) land evacuation; (e) emergencyhrace position and floor lighting; (f) water evacuation; and (g) water evacuation- on ovenvater aircraft. Results indicated that 2 1 of <b>the</b> 40 <b>pictorials</b> presented were within the acceptable range of the IS 0 67 % comprehension criterion, whereas only 1 1 of <b>the</b> 40 <b>pictorials</b> were within <b>the</b> ANSI 85 % comprehension criterion. Comprehension of <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> comprising <b>the</b> oxygen pictogram was the highest among the seven categories of pictograms tested. However, <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> that connoted "move away from the aircraft", which were found in the land evacuation pictograms, were the least comprehended. Implications for aviation safety card design are discussed...|$|R
50|$|In 1938 <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> were re-issued with a {{portrait}} of George VI replacing his father's image. Various colour and perforation changes ensued, with the last being issued in February 1953.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the 1930s, as the {{magazine}} struggled to regain its relevance, it changed names {{a number of}} times. With the December 1930 issue, {{the magazine}} re-christened itself The New Royal Magazine. Beginning in June 1932, it became <b>The</b> Royal <b>Pictorial.</b> Beginning in January 1935, it was <b>The</b> Royal Screen <b>Pictorial,</b> and in June 1935, the word [...] "Royal" [...] was dropped entirely as it became <b>The</b> Screen <b>Pictorial.</b> <b>The</b> magazines final issue was in September 1939, the month in which the Second World War began in Europe. In total, 491 issues were published.|$|R
5|$|The {{resultant}} public mockery created panic {{within the}} medical profession and ruined the careers of several prominent surgeons. The affair was satirised on many occasions, not least by <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> satirist and social critic William Hogarth, who was notably critical of {{the medical profession}}'s gullibility. Toft was eventually released without charge and returned home.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E
25|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> in Vanity Fair have {{attracted}} criticism. The April 1999 issue featured {{an image of}} actor Mike Myers dressed as a Hindu deity for a photo spread by David LaChapelle: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{accounts}} {{characterize the}} strident criticism that greeted <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> as a spontaneous, broad-based public reaction, {{motivated by the}} patriotic conviction that national heroes were the only acceptable subjects for U.S. stamps. The truth, however, {{seems to be more}} complicated, for the tone of much of the press commentary about <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> suggests that an organized campaign was attempting to discredit them. To liken the design on the 30-cent stamp to [...] "a bunch of rags hung out of a junk shop" [...] as least raises an aesthetic issue; but the statement that the 2-cent stamp represented [...] "Booth's Death ride into Maryland" [...] is surely defamation pure and simple, indicating an agenda that {{has little to do with}} the question of stamp design.|$|R
50|$|The watermarks of <b>the</b> <b>pictorials</b> of 1900 are {{unlike any}} other watermarks used in the French area: they are plant branches, with thistle for the low values (up to 15c), rose for middle values (up to 75c), and an olive branch for the three franc values.|$|R
5|$|Donatian {{stands in}} front of a set of windows that are just outside <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space. He holds a jewelled processional cross in his left hand, and a wheel {{containing}} five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained glass was smashed. The majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered in the famous style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion vessels that had escaped the Dissolution were melted down so that only about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E
5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He {{is dressed in}} sombre colours and rendered in a more compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although {{he appears to be}} resting or asleep.|$|E
50|$|The {{school has}} {{established}} {{a partnership with the}} Coral Gables Museum and will be doing activities with the students. The first such activity is a canvas <b>pictorial</b> that <b>the</b> students created under the direction of art teacher Ms. Bushman. <b>The</b> <b>pictorials</b> depict historic places in the Gables.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pictorial</b> {{space is}} bathed in soft light, {{probably}} an influence from Jan van Eyck. The light {{falls from the}} right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's heads on the left wall of the niche. The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn. The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are four small holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.|$|E
5|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the meaning of}} the glyphs, Dietrich matched traditional Polynesian names for stars & astronomical bodies with <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> representations of rongorongo. This method revealed a high degree of consistency, suggesting that most if not all of the glyphs represent astronomical and navigational concepts. Dietrich argues that other researchers have been misled by the literal resemblances of the glyphs, not realizing that they are abstract symbols for the stars (cf. western astronomical symbols). This fits a pattern consistent among many cultures, in which constellations are identified with people, animals, objects, and mythological beings.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. <b>The</b> <b>pictorial</b> space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

5|$|In August 1956, Paul Mansfield sought {{custody of}} his daughter, alleging that Jayne was an unfit mother because she {{appeared}} nude in Playboy. In 1964, the magazine repeated <b>the</b> <b>pictorial.</b> Photos from that pictorial were reprinted {{in a number of}} Playboy issues, including December 1965 ("The Playboy Portfolio of Sex Stars"), January 1979 ("25 Beautiful Years"), January 1984 ("30 Memorable Years"), January 1989 ("Women of the Fifties"), January 1994 ("Remember Jayne"), November 1996 ("Playboy Gallery"), August 1999 ("Playboy's Sex Stars of the Century"; Special edition), and January 2000 ("Centerfolds of the Century"). In the week following her first Playboy appearance, Mansfield caught Hollywood and media attention by dropping her bikini-top at a press junket for the Jane Russell film Underwater! (RKO, 1955).|$|E
5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in <b>the</b> <b>pictorial</b> space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 {{issue of}} Playboy, which helped launch her career and {{increased}} the magazine's circulation; Playboy had begun publishing from publishereditor Hugh Hefner's kitchen the year before. In 1964, the magazine repeated <b>the</b> <b>pictorial.</b> Photos from that pictorial was reprinted {{in a number of}} Playboy issues, including: December 1965 ("The Playboy Portfolio of Sex Stars"), January 1979 ("25 Beautiful Years"), January 1984 ("30 Memorable Years"), January 1989 ("Women Of The Fifties"), January 1994 ("Remember Jayne"), November 1996 ("Playboy Gallery"), August 1999 ("Playboy's Sex Stars of the Century"; Special edition), and January 2000 ("Centerfolds Of The Century"). In the Lee Siegel novel Who Wrote the Book of Love?, the character Lucky Lee turns the issue of Playboy into a bribe to meet a girl.|$|E
