5|$|There {{are about}} fifty blue {{point-like}} {{objects in the}} HDF.

Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are white dwarfs, because they are too blue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.|$|E

5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurids, {{like their}} tyrannosauroid ancestors, were heterodont, with premaxillary teeth D-shaped {{in cross section}} and smaller than the rest. Unlike earlier tyrannosauroids and most other theropods, the maxillary and mandibular teeth of mature tyrannosaurids are not blade-like but {{extremely}} thickened and often circular in cross-section, with some species having reduced serrations. Tooth counts tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> within species, and larger species tend to have lower tooth counts than smaller ones. For example, Alioramus had 76 to 78 teeth in its jaws, while Tyrannosaurus had between 54 and 60.|$|E
5|$|At {{the most}} extreme points of its perceptibility, it was felt with {{intensity}} II or III (Weak) at Healdsburg {{in the north and}} Santa Barbara in the south, Visalia in the central valley and Twain Harte in the Sierra Nevada foothills. It was also listed as having been felt (with no specific intensity level given) by residents in high-rise buildings in Reno, Nevada. Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E

After this, he {{was appointed}} the Director of Military Training at Army Headquarters in April 1954. But he was soon posted as commandant of the Infantry School at Mhow, and also became the colonel of both 8 Gorkha Rifles and 61st Cavalry. 8 Gorkha Rifles became his new regiment, since his original parent regiment, the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, had become part of the new Pakistan Army at partition. He was also part of the 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) briefly as he had received his posting order as Commanding Officer of 3/5 Gorkha Rifles (FF). During his tenure as the commandant of the Infantry School, he discovered that the training manuals were outdated, and was instrumental in revamping the manuals <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with the tactics employed by the Indian Army.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{case for}} computational chemistry is the gas-phase chemistry, {{in which a}} substance is treated {{as if it was}} a gas to eliminate the necessity of taking interactions between molecules in account. Research by multiple authors has been undertaken on dubnium pentachloride: it has been calculated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with the periodic laws by exhibiting properties of a compound of a d-block element. For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. One property dubnium pentachloride is expected to show is its increased (compared to its tantalum analog) covalence: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).|$|E

5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} unripe fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E
