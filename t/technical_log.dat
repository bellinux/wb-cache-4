Both landing gear legs subsequently had to be replaced. In their final report the Portuguese accident investigation authority the Aviation Accidents Prevention and Investigation Department determined that the primary cause of the incident was the ground spoilers deploying in flight after the aircraft had bounced 12 ft off the runway. Contributing factors were the failure of the pilot to go-around after the bounce, the failure of the pilot to release the thrust levers before the first touchdown (which inhibited the ground spoilers deploying) and the pilot providing insufficient flare input. Airbus subsequently introduced a new software standard for the A320 in July 2010 to modify the ground spoiler deployment logic.|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were; firstly, to obtain {{economic}} values for radiata pine traits to produce appearance and structural lumber, and secondly {{to analyze the}} selection of efficient logs and profitable trees to substantiate the development of breeding objectives for solid wood quality. The thesis included three approaches to value wood attributes: hedonic models, partial regressions and stochastic frontiers. Hedonic models generated economic values for pruned and unpruned log traits to produce appearance grades. Values for small end diameter were 0. 33, 0. 19 and 0. 10 US $/mm, and for form 2. 6, 1. 4 and 0. 63 US $ for the first, second and third log respectively. The value of mean internode length was 0. 19 US $/cm. Branch size traits were non-significant to explain the log conversion return (p> 0. 05). The economic value of log traits to produce structural lumber with stiffness of 8, 10 and 12 GPa was estimated with a partial regression. The values were 1. 1, 29. 7, 0. 3 and - 0. 4 NZ $/m 3 for small end diameter (cm), stiffness (GPa), basic density (kg/m 3) and largest branch (mm) respectively. Small end diameter and stiffness explained 73 % of the variation of log conversion return. The economic values for structural attributes were also derived from a Cobb Douglas stochastic frontier, resulting in 2. 1 NZ $/cm for small end diameter and 15. 8 NZ $/GPa for stiffness. The change of values between approaches {{can be attributed to}} differences of model formulation. The stochastic frontier used aggregate volume of lumber with stiffness of 8 GPa or higher. The partial regression used the economic value of every lumber product derived from the logs, making it more sensitive to changes in wood quality. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) used structural traits and their economic values to assess the technical and economic efficiency of logs to produce lumber with stiffness of 8, 10 and 12 GPa. The most efficient logs had 1 : 4 ratios between stiffness and small end diameter, whereas logs that did not generate structural lumber had ratios closer to 1 : 8. Trait economic values from the partial regression analysis were used as attribute prices to estimate cost efficiency. Efficiency measures were significantly correlated with stiffness and log conversion return; however, they were non-significantly correlated with small end diameter and <b>log</b> prices. The <b>technical</b> efficiency of <b>logs</b> to produce structural lumber was also determined using a Cobb Douglas stochastic frontier which determined that the most efficient logs were characterized by a 1 : 5 ratio between stiffness and small end diameter. Selection of trees for deployment was analyzed with a portfolio model, where risk was represented as the mean absolute deviation of tree returns due to the variability of volume, stiffness and resin defects. Under high variability (risk), the model selected structural trees with large stiffness and high return. These results suggest an opportunity for narrowing genetic variability (via clonal or family forestry) to make the returns from radiata pine structural grades lumber less risky. As variability decreased the portfolio model opted for trees that produced appearance and structural lumber. These trees had a stabilizing effect on their returns, as there were phenotypic tradeoffs between stiffness and volume under optimistic and pessimistic growing scenarios. These results showed the benefits of product diversification at the tree level...|$|R
40|$|Production and {{productivity}} can be boosted either through {{increased use of}} inputs and/or improvement in technology or by improving the efficiency of producers or firms, given fixed level of inputs and technology. Even though agriculture stays the main stay of Ethiopian economy, level of agricultural productivity in general and crop productivity in particular is very low. Out of the total grain production in Ethiopia, cereals account for roughly 60 percent of rural employment and 80 percent of total cultivated land. However, Yield of cereals has been consistently well below world and even of least developing countries average yield, indicating poor productivity of the crops in the country. Given capital constraint in the country, {{it is difficult to}} adopt new technology to enhance productivity. Hence, working to improve production efficiency is best option on hand. As a result, {{there are a number of}} studies done on area of efficiency analysis in Ethiopia. However, the novelty of this study can be explained by three facts. First of all it has used national data, collected by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), with enough number of observations to do plot level analysis considering biological factors that determine inefficiency. Second, efficiency analysis is not based on a single crop rather on major crops in general as well as teff, wheat and maize independently. Last but not least, the study employed one stage approach in which both technical efficiency and factors of inefficiency are analyzed simultaneously. Therefore, this study was done to evaluate the efficiency and identify factors that explain the variation in inefficiency of crop production in Ethiopia. This study principally used the 2009 Ethiopia Rural Household Survey (ERHS) which is collected by IFPRI. As far as analysis is concerned, both descriptive and econometric methods were used. Descriptive statistics (mean, percentage, range, etc.) is used to summarize the variables in the model and describe the study area. Econometric model, Stochastic Production Frontier model, is used to estimate the elasticity of production function, determine the determinants of inefficiency and estimate the level of efficiency. Given that we are considering a developing country setting where by the main concern is output shortfall rather than input over use, preference has been given to primal or output oriented approach of measuring efficiency. In this study, effort was made to test the hypotheses before rushing to interpret the model outputs. First, the γ parameter estimates of all production functions were significant at 5 % significance level, indicating Stochastic Frontier Production function is more appropriate than convectional production function or there is significant technical inefficiency variation among plots. The γ value of 0. 636 for the major crops production function can be then interpreted as, 63 % of the variation in output among plots is explained by technical inefficiency. Similarly, variation in out put due to technical inefficiency for teff, wheat and maize production were calculated to be 88. 5, 45. 5 and 77. 8 percent respectively. The second step, following the existence of inefficiency, is to check if there exist one or more variables that could explain the variation in <b>technical</b> inefficiency. <b>Log</b> likelihood ratio was used to test the hypothesis. Accordingly, all calculated LL ratio values were greater than the critical value of LL ratio, with upper 5 % level of significance. Hence, the null hypotheses that determinant variables in the inefficiency effect model are simultaneously equal to zero are rejected. In other words, there exists at least one explanatory variable that explains the variation in the technical inefficiency among plots. The ML estimate results shown that, all variables were found to be binding in the production of major crops, meaning that an increase in one of inputs will enhance output keeping everything constant. As far as teff production is concerned, only land was a significant variable that explains the variation in teff output among plots. Land, DAP and seed were found to have significant and positive effect in wheat production. According to result of this study, land and seed were major determinants of maize production in Ethiopia. Generally, all significant input variables were found to affect output positively, as expected. Moreover, the model output depicted that the mean level of TE for major crops, Teff, Wheat and Maize production was found to be 63. 56, 67. 26, 84. 16 and 91. 41 percent, respectively. The inefficiency effect analysis shown that, age of the household head measured in years was found to be the determinant of technical inefficiency, of teff production and education was found to have negative and significant effect on major crops and wheat technical inefficiency (1 % significance level). Knowledge about land policy was found to have significant and negative effect on technical inefficiency of wheat production (1 % significance level). Similarly, participation in soil and water conservation activities was found to have negative and significant effect on technical inefficiency of major crops and wheat production. In this study frequency of extension contact was found to have unexpected and strange result; the more frequently the farmers meet extension workers the more it competes their time to do agricultural activities. The result of this study also confirmed as rich farmers are relatively less inefficient than poor once, in major crops production, and fertile plots of wheat are significantly less inefficient than infertile once. Similarly, flat teff and maize plots are more efficient than otherwise. The other plot specific variable that was found to have negative and significant effect on technical inefficiency of major crop production was adoption of improved seed. The last but not least, variable that explains variation in inefficiency was found to be livestock ownership. Generally, results of this study confirmed that there is a room to enhance productivity by improving the efficiency of production, given same level of input and current technology...|$|R

The research was carried out in the Management Unit "Bjelovarska Bilogora", Forest Office Bjelovar, Forest Administration Bjelovar. All investigated compartments pertain to ecological management type II-D- 11 and management class BEECH with a 100 -year rotation. The age of the investigated cutblocks ranged between 59 and 91 with thinning, between 94 and 110 with preparatory cut, between 100 and 112 with seed cut and between 98 and 114 with final cut. The group of sample trees was formed by random selection of approximately 10 % of marked trees. The sample for compiling assortment tables {{in accordance with the}} requirements of the Croatian standards for forest harvesting products of 1995 involved 3001 sample trees (table 1), and assortment tables were compiled in accordance with the requirements of the Croatian standard HRN EN 1316 - 1 : 1999 based on 3082 sample trees (table 2). Share tables of wood assortments determined in accordance with these two standards were developed, for various reasons, separately for thinnings and preparatory felling, and separately for seeding and final felling. By processing sample trees in accordance with the requirements of the Croatian Standards for Forest Harvesting Products of 1995, 10, 098 pieces of technical roundwood were obtained, whose total volume was 4, 337 m 3 (without bark). In accordance with the requirements of this Standard, total processed and classified net volume of all sample trees was 7, 469 m 3. By bucking sample trees in accordance with the requirements of the Croatian Standard Hardwood round wood - Qualitative classification - Part 1 : Oak and Beech HRN EN 1316 - 1 : 1999, 13, 507 pieces of technical roundwood were obtained, whose total volume was 6, 010 m 3 (without bark), and in accordance with the requirements of this Standard, the net volume of all sample trees was 8, 931 m 3. Due to substantial differences, structural comparison of technical roundwood classified in accordance with the requirements of these two standards is more simple and adequate for wood assortments of the best quality, veneer logs - A quality class (Fig. 1) and assortments of the lowest quality class, 3 rd class sawlogs - D quality class (Fig. 4). The comparison is much more difficult with other quality classes of <b>technical</b> roundwood, <b>logs</b> for rotary cutting - 1 st quality class sawlogs - B quality class (Fig. 2), 2 nd class sawlogs - C quality class (Fig. 3), due to even more significant differences between standard requirements with respect to dimensions, range of timber defects, and number of quality classes. Differences between the Croatian standards for forest harvesting products (1995), still applied in Croatian forestry and international standards Hardwood round wood - Qualitative classification - Part 1 : Oak and Beech EN 1316 - 1 : 1999 are numerous and significant. Differences are related to the number of quality class, prescribed minimum dimensions, range of roundwood defects along with way of measurement of technical roundwood and they reflect to different share of wood assortments (quality classes) determined in accordance with the requirements of individual standards. However, the key difference between these two standards {{lies in the fact that}} according to the "old" Croatian standards technical roundwood was classified by purpose, and according to the "new" Croatian standards technical roundwood is classified by quality, therefore avoiding to define its future purpose. Consequently, the comparison of percentage shares of wood assortments in the assortment tables is difficult, and defining unambiguous conclusions (except for assortments of technical roundwood of the highest and lowest quality) is questionable. Differences in contents between international standards and standards currently in use in Croatian forestry shall necessarily bring operational changes in bucking, scaling, classifying and marketing of forest products. Operational changes (partly conditioned by the acceptance of international laws and regulations) shall also be accompanied by certain changes in relationships within the forestry sector...|$|R

Therefore, {{it can be argued}} that information is an organisation’s most precious asset and as with all other assets, like equipment, money, personnel, and so on, this asset needs to be protected properly at all times (Whitman & Mattord, 2003, pp. 1 - 14). The introduction of modern technologies, such as e-commerce, will not only increase the value of information, but will also increase security requirements of those organizations that are intending to utilize such technologies. Evidence of these requirements can be observed in the 2001 CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey (Power, 2001). According to this source, the annual financial losses caused through security breaches in 2001 have increased by 277 % when compared to the results from 1997. The 2002 and 2003 Computer Crime and Security Survey confirms this by stating that the threat of computer crime and other related information security breaches continues unabated and that the financial toll is mounting (Richardson, 2003). Information is normally protected by means of a process of identifying, implementing, managing and maintaining a set of information security controls, countermeasures or safeguards (GMITS, 1998). In the rest of this thesis, the term security controls will be utilized when referring to information protection mechanisms or procedures. These security controls can be of a physical (for example, door locks), a technical (for example, passwords) and/or a procedural nature (for example, to make back-up copies of critical files) (Pfleeger, 2003, pp. 22 - 23; Stallings, 1995, p. 1). The effective identification, implementation, management and maintenance of this set of security controls are usually integrated into an Information Security Management Program, the objective of which is to ensure an acceptable level of information confidentiality, integrity and availability within the organisation at all times (Pfleeger, 2003, pp. 10 - 12; Whitman & Mattord, 2003, pp. 1 - 14; Von Solms, 1993). Once the most effective security controls have been identified and implemented, it is important that this level of security be maintained through a process of continued control. For this reason, it is important that proper change management, measurement, audit, monitoring and detection be implemented (Bruce & Dempsey, 1997). Monitoring and detection are important functions and refer to the ability to identify and detect situations where information security policies have been compromised and/or breached or security violations have taken place (BS 7799, 1999; GMITS, 1998; Von Solms, 1993). The Information Security Officer is usually the person responsible for most of the operational tasks in the control process within an Information Security Management Program (Von Solms, 1993). In practice, these tasks could also be performed by a system administrator, network administrator, etc. In the rest of the thesis the person responsible for these tasks will be referred to as system administrator. These tasks have proved to be very challenging and demanding. The main reason for this is the rapid advancement of technology in the discipline of Information Technology, for example, the modern distributed computing environment, the Internet, the “freedom” of end-users, the introduction of e-commerce, and etc. (Whitman & Mattord, 2003, p. 9; Sundaram, 2000, p. 1; Moses, 2001, p. 6; Allen, 2001, p. 1). As a result of the importance of this control process, and especially the monitoring and detection tasks, it is vital that the system administrator has proper tools at his/her disposal to perform this task effectively. Many of the tools that are currently available to the system administrator, utilize technical controls, such as, audit logs and user profiles. Audit logs are normally used to record all events executed on a system. These logs are simply files that record security and non-security related events that take place on a computer system within an organisation. For this reason, these logs can be used by these tools to gain valuable information on security violations, such as intrusions and, therefore, are able to monitor the current actions of each user (Microsoft, 2002; Smith, 1989, pp. 116 - 117). User profiles are files that contain information about users` desktop operating environments and are used by the operating system to structure each user environment so that it is the same each time a user logs onto the system (Microsoft, 2002; Block, 1994, p. 54). Thus, a user profile is used to indicate which actions the user is allowed to perform on the system. Both <b>technical</b> controls (audit <b>logs</b> and user profiles) are frequently available in most computer environments (such as, UNIX, Firewalls, Windows, etc.) (Cooper et al, 1995, p. 129). Therefore, seeing that the audit logs record most events taking place on an information system and the user profile indicates the authorized actions of each user, the system administrator could most probably utilise these controls in a more proactive manner...|$|R
