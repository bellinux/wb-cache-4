25|$|If one invests $100 in {{an inverse}} ETF {{position}} in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value changes to $80 {{and then to}} $60, then {{the value of the}} inverse ETF position will increase by 20% (because the asset decreased by 20% from 100 to 80) and then increase by 25% (because the asset decreased by 25% from 80 to 60). So the ETF's value will be $100*1.20*1.25=$150. The gain of an equivalent short position will however be $100–$60=$40, and so we see that the capital gain of the ETF outweighs the volatility loss relative to the short position. However, if the market swings back to $100 again, then the net profit of the short position is zero. However, since the value of the asset increased by 67% (from $60 to $100), the inverse ETF must lose 67%, meaning it will lose $100. Thus <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> shorts went from $100 to $140 and back to $100. <b>The</b> <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the inverse ETF, however, went from $100 to $150 to $50.|$|E
