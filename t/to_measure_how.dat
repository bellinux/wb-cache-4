5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> {{strongly}} different genes {{are expressed in}} a sample of biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Tests exist <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> much {{sensation}} {{a person}} has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E

5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

25|$|Denmark has an {{outstanding}} {{performance in the}} global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 4 out of 180 countries in 2016. This recent and significant increase in ranking and performance is mostly due to remarkable achievements in energy efficiency and reductions in CO2 emission levels. A future implementation of air quality improvements are expected. The EPI was established in 2001 by the World Economic Forum as a global gauge <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The environmental areas where Denmark performs best (i.e. lowest ranking) are sanitation (12), water resource management (13) and health impacts of environmental issues (14), followed closely by the area of biodiversity and habitat. The latter are due to the many protection laws and protected areas of significance within the country even though the EPI is not considering how well these laws and regulations are affecting the current biodiversity and habitats in reality; one of many weaknesses in the EPI. Denmark performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) {{in the areas of}} environmental effects of fisheries (128) and forest management (96). The very poor ranking in the fisheries area are due to alarmingly low and continually rapidly declining fish stocks, placing Denmark among the worst performing countries of the world.|$|E

This paper aims to make a contribution to this debate: negatively, by criticising orthodox productivity measures; and positively, proposing an alternative way of measuring performance differences. The first section of the paper supplies an essential context for the subsequent argument by providing a brief history of productivity's usage since the late 1940 s. The second section presents a calculation of car assembler productivity which is then deconstructed to show the problems inherent in orthodox productivity measurement which works by vertical cumulation. The third section then constructively proposes a shift to new ways of measuring lateral difference which open up new terrain. ?? 1994...|$|R

500|$|As seismic and {{volcanic}} activity increased, volcanologists {{working for the}} USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe any impending eruption. Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on and around the growing lava domes, and, on May 1, 1980, established the ColdwaterI and II observation posts to use laser ranging <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> the distances to these reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed. Glicken monitored the volcano for two weeks, taking shelter in a trailer at the Coldwater II site located {{a little more than}} [...] northwest of the volcano. On May 18, 1980, after working for six days straight, Glicken took the day off to attend an interview for his graduate work with his professor, Richard V. Fisher, in Mammoth, California. His research adviser and mentor David A. Johnston replaced him at his post, despite expressing concerns about its safety given indications of mobile magma within the volcano. After a magnitude5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide at 8:32a.m., Mount St. Helens erupted. Johnston was killed after he was enveloped by swift pyroclastic flows that traveled down the mountain's flanks at near supersonic speeds.|$|E

Music critic Steve McPherson noted that its first two {{measures}} sound [...] "like a disaster", contrasting its solid groove. While most musical compositions rely on tension and release, which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses, gradual buildup, sublte tension within verses or {{over the course of}} the bridge, or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation, D'Angelo's arrangements subdivide the tension into each moment of the song. According to McPherson, this results in [...] "no linear way <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can't be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way. For lack of a less cliched word, it's entirely 'feel'". Similar to most of the song's album, Voodoo, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] has this syncopation style as its center. D'Angelo's casual vocal style follows the same concept, applying it to melody, harmony, and phrasing, and is accompanied by falsetto climbs and skittery phrasing similar to Prince's singing.|$|E
