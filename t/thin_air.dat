Originally, the {{producers}} of the film adaption of the book Into <b>Thin</b> <b>Air</b> were contacted to help. The film producers were shocked at the trouble the Simpsons staff were going to, and replied that they had simply made up translations in the film. The staff then had to consult various experts by telephone.|$|E
5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of <b>thin</b> <b>air.</b> Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E
5|$|Festival du Voyageur, Western Canada's largest winter festival, {{celebrates the}} early French explorers of the Red River Valley. Folklorama {{is the largest}} and longest-running {{cultural}} celebration festival in the world. The Jazz Winnipeg Festival and the Winnipeg Folk Festival both celebrate Winnipeg's music community. The Winnipeg Music Festival offers a competition venue to amateur musicians. The Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival is the second-largest alternative theatre festival in North America. The Winnipeg International Writers Festival (also called <b>THIN</b> <b>AIR)</b> brings writers to Winnipeg for workshops and readings. The LGBT community in the city is served by Pride Winnipeg, an annual gay pride festival and parade, and Reel Pride, a film festival of LGBT-themed films.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, sprint athletes {{perform better}} at high altitudes {{because of the}} <b>thinner</b> <b>air,</b> which {{provides}} less air resistance. In theory, the <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the partial pressure of oxygen being lower), but this difference is negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash {{is already in the}} muscles and bloodstream when the race starts. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000 m above sea level are marked with an [...] "A." ...|$|R

5|$|The fort is {{supposedly}} {{haunted by the}} Black Knight, who wears the armour and regalia of the Order of St. John, and resembles Grand Master de Vilhena. In the 1940s, the knight began to appear out of <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> near {{the ruins of the}} Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, which had just been bombed in World War II. The apparition was reportedly seen by Maltese and English men within the fort. When the rubble from the ruined chapel began to be cleared, the workmen reported that the knight was supervising their work. When the crypt beneath the chapel was opened, it was found that it had been vandalized, and the remains of knights which had been buried there were scattered around. After the crypt was restored and the bones were reburied, the Black Knight stopped appearing. In 1980, the crypt was vandalized for a second time, and the Black Knight reportedly began to appear again.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were unable}} to start a fire using {{friction}} due to the <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to give some protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into <b>thin</b> <b>air.</b> After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

50|$|Qualifying for the Mexican Grand Prix saw few surprises. The turbo powered {{cars were}} {{expected}} to dominate in the high (2240 m) altitude of Mexico City where the naturally aspirated cars would lose approximately 20-25% of their power in the <b>thinner</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|By comparison, {{the summit}} of Mt. Everest is at 8848 m;commercial airliners {{typically}} cruise between 10 km and 13 km where the <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach 30.4 km and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0 km.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{agreed-upon}} end to {{the upper}} atmosphere, but rather incrementally <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> from the stratosphere (~50 km), mesosphere (~85 km), and thermosphere (~690 km) up to the exosphere (~10,000) (see also thermopause).

5000|$|Sucre (...) is the {{constitutional}} capital of Bolivia, {{the capital of}} the Chuquisaca Department, and the 6th most populated city in Bolivia. Located in the south-central part of the country, Sucre lies at an elevation of 2,810 meters (9,214 feet). This relatively high altitude gives the city a cool temperate climate year-round and much <b>thinner</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|A simple {{approximation}} is {{to consider}} that a mountain's apparent altitude at your eye (in degrees) will exceed its true altitude by its distance in kilometers divided by 1500. This assumes a fairly horizontal line of sight and ordinary air density; if the mountain is very high (so much of the sightline is in <b>thinner</b> <b>air)</b> divide by 1600 instead.|$|R
50|$|Insects can fly and kite at {{very high}} altitude. In 2008, a colony of bumble bees was {{discovered}} on Mount Everest at more than 5,600 m above sea level, the highest known altitude for an insect. In subsequent tests some of the bees were still able to fly in a flight chamber which recreated the <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> of 9,000 m.|$|R

25|$|Initial {{response}} to the P-47 praised its dive speed and high-altitude performance, while criticizing its turning performance and rate of climb (particularly at low-to-medium altitudes). The turbosupercharger in the P-47 gave the powerplant its maximum power at 27,000ft (8,230m), and in the <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> above 30,000ft (9,144m), the Thunderbolt remained comparatively fast and nimble relative to other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Long after personal, {{political}} and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> and ether, Magritte, MirÃ³, DalÃ­ {{and the other}} Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include Giorgio de Chirico, MÃ©ret Oppenheim, Toyen, GrÃ©goire Michonze, Roberto Matta, Kay Sage, Leonora Carrington, Dorothea Tanning, and Leonor Fini among others.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{attempts}} {{have moved to}} high-altitude locations, such as Mexico City, where the <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> results in lower aerodynamic drag, which more than offsets the added difficulty of breathing. Innovations in equipment and the rider's position on the bike have also led to dramatic improvements in the hour record, but have also {{been a source of}} controversy (see Graeme Obree).|$|R
50|$|High {{temperatures}} {{also result}} in <b>thinner</b> <b>air,</b> {{which results in}} less drag on athletes in sports where air resistance plays a major role. Velodrome designers capitalise on this, heating the stadium {{in the hope of}} making the cycling faster, and The Daily Telegraph has reported that some Olympic Games organisers have pumped cold air into velodromes to give rival teams a disadvantage in close time trials.|$|R
50|$|The sixth All-Africa Games {{were held}} in September 1995 in Harare, Zimbabwe. As the track is at an {{altitude}} of 1473 metres all performances are considered to be set at altitude, this is believed to assist events up to 400 metres and in the long jump and triple jump. However, for events beyond 800 metres the <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> is believed to have a detrimental effect on performances.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from losing}} points from a house, serious misdeeds at Hogwarts are {{punishable}} by detention. Whenever a student loses a house point, their house jewels (ruby for Gryffindors, emeralds for Slytherin, sapphires for Ravenclaw, and topazes for Hufflepuff) are {{taken away from}} a glass hourglass located in every classroom. The same goes for adding points to the specific house, although the teacher or prefect must conjure the gems from <b>thin</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{etiquette}} surrounding {{using the}} fireplace for communication is not explicitly {{addressed in the}} series. Dumbledore tells Harry it is not polite for a wizard to apparate (appear out of <b>thin</b> <b>air)</b> directly into another wizard's house. However, Harry uses floo powder to cause his head into Grimmauld Place unannounced. On the other hand, we see Severus Snape call Lupin's name and tell him he wants a word before speaking to Remus Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban.|$|E
25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure. The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required â this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of <b>thin</b> <b>air.</b> Boyer says cognitive science can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations {{and in so doing}} enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.|$|E
5000|$|The AIM-54 Phoenix, {{developed}} for the F-111B fleet air defense fighter, had an airframe with four cruciform fins that was a scaled-up version of the AIM-47.
