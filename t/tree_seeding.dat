40|$|International audienceDirect <b>tree</b> <b>seeding</b> {{was used}} in the past in {{afforestation}} and has nowadays a renewed interest due to its potential low cost, better tree seedling establishment and easiness to use in comparison with tree plantation. However many problems must still be solved before its full development. Seeds of forest trees are frequently dormant when harvested or after a period of storage and their germination needs the release of dormancy, either by exposition to natural climate, or by artificial means when known. Tree dormancy feature was studied in a controlled experiment in nursery in Nancy for 20 different common species in East of France, corresponding to 3 successional stages after field abandonment: thorny shrubs, pioneer fruit trees and forest trees. No prepared seeds were sown either in spring or in autumn, buried or not into the soil and watered or not, each modality being replicated 4 times. Tree emergence and growth were regularly recorded during 3 years. For most species best emergence rates were recorded one or two years after a sowing in spring, meaning that they need several months of exposure to natural conditions to release from dormancy.

40|$|Climate {{change may}} {{increase}} the occurrence of droughts and fires in the Amazon. Most of our understanding on how fire affects tropical ecosystems is based on studies of non-flooded forest–savanna ecotones. Nonetheless, tropical floodplain forests in the Amazon can burn severely during extreme droughts. The mechanisms slowing down forest regeneration in these ecosystems remain poorly understood and have never been assessed in the field. We studied the recovery of Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests after one and two fire events. We used Landsat images to map fire history and conducted field surveys to measure forest structure, tree species richness, <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> bank and post-fire invasion of herbaceous plants. Sites burnt once had on average 0 % trees, 6 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> abundance, 23 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> species richness and 8 % root mat thickness compared to unburnt forests. In contrast, herbaceous cover increased from 0 to 72 %. Nonetheless, forest structure and diversity recovered slowly towards pre-burn levels, except for <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> banks that remained depleted even 15 years after fire. Sites burnt twice had on average 0 % trees, 1 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> abundance, 3 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> species richness and 1 % root mat thickness compared to unburnt forests. Herbaceous cover increased to 100 %. Mean recovery of tree basal area was 50 % slower and of root mat thickness 93 % slower compared to recovery in sites burnt once. <b>Tree</b> <b>seed</b> banks did not recover at all, and herbaceous cover persisted close to 100 % for more than 20 years after the second fire. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that after a second fire event, Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests lose their recovery capacity, and persist in a non-forested state dominated by herbaceous vegetation. Such fragility implies that preventing human ignited fires during drought episodes is a particularly important conservation strategy for these ecosystems. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDirect <b>tree</b> <b>seeding</b> is a {{potentially}} promising technique for the afforestation of large areas at relatively low cost. However, {{the technique is}} not yet widely practised due {{to a range of}} limiting biological factors and practical considerations. The techniques of sowing in themselves could lead to important problems, for example in the case of steep slopes, or when using mixtures with different seed sizes and weights. The manager also has to decide on optimum sowing date, bearing in mind the dormancy status of seed, and balancing the risks from predation over winter from early sowing with the danger of seed death due to extreme temperatures from later sowing dates. Invading weeds can also jeopardize tree seedling growth by competition for resources, particularly during the early stages of tree establishment. Finally, only few data exist on {{the quantity and quality of}} seeds available on the market and real costs associated with the technique. In Claye-Souilly, East of Paris, a twenty-ha site, property of the French Railway Company, was established in 2005. Using 120 plots of 800 m² in size, it compared different techniques of tree seed sowing, mixtures of seeds, and techniques of mulching to control weed species. Results from this experiment and data from the literature will be discussed with special emphasis on practical recommendations for the use of direct <b>tree</b> <b>seeding...</b>|$|E

40|$|Direct <b>tree</b> <b>seeding</b> is {{potentially}} an economical technique for restoring forests on abandoned fields. However, {{the success of}} tree establishment depends on many factors related to species and seed characteristics, environmental conditions, competition and predation. We compared seedling emergence, survival and growth of six tree species of different seed sizes in a forest restoration project of abandoned fields. Species were seeded in plots with and without herbaceous vegetation and with and without protection from bird and mammal predation. Yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) did not emerge in all treatments, paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and tamarack (Larix laricina) had a seedling emergence rate lower than 1 %, and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) had a low overall emergence rate of 6 %. Seedling emergence reached 57 % for northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and 34 % for red pine (Pinus resinosa), but survival of oak after one year was much higher (92 %) than pine seedlings (16 %). Overall, protection from birds and mammals and elimination of the herbaceous vegetation cover had no detectable effects on seedling emergence, survival and height. Nonetheless, red oak seedlings growing {{in the presence of}} vegetation had a smaller diameter and shoot biomass and a larger specific leaf area. We conclude that only large seeded species, such as oak, should be used for forest restoration of abandoned fields by direct seeding in our region...|$|E
40|$|The {{low cost}} of direct <b>tree</b> <b>seeding</b> makes it {{increasingly}} useful for afforestation. However, {{the success of}} the technique is often unpredictable due to a series of different adverse biotic and abiotic factors. A plant cover with low competitive ability towards resources could offer a natural alternative to the herbicides currently used to control weeds. The effects of cover plants on availability of resources and microclimate were studied in a field experiment in the central France during three years. An experiment design crossing three mixtures of tree seeds with four vegetation compositions (a bare soil, flora of the meadow, and two mixtures of cover plants) was established and repeated randomly in three blocks in a meadow. Vegetation composition, tree seedling emergence, light availability, soil water content, and temperatures under each treatment were measured. The vegetation composition of the meadow stayed stable, with grass species dominating. The cover plants sown disappeared rapidly after one or two years. Outcome of direct seeding of trees depended on the vegetation treatment. Bare soil gave the highest emergence rate while meadow vegetation gave the lowest, with the mixture of cover plants being intermediate. Light availability and soil water content were very low under the meadow vegetation but were very high on the bare soil, again with cover plant mixtures being intermediate. This study confirms that a bare soil obtained by herbicide is a secure way to ensure tree seedling establishment in afforestation by direct seeding. However, with the onus currently on reducing herbicide use, the results suggest that sowing a mixture of cover plants could be an acceptable alternative to herbicides. The cover plants could offer protection against frost, scorching temperatures, or the water run-off encountered on bare soil. However, there are also a number of unresolved issues that need be addressed before the cover plants technique can be recommended. (c) Elsevie...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{regulating}} the eruptive population dynamics of house mice, Mus musculus, and ship rats, Rattus rattus, were investigated over 29 months in mixed forest at Lake Waikaremoana, New Zealand. Mice and rats are generally present at low density, but erupt periodically following synchronous southern beech (Nothofagus spp.) seeding. A range of factors proposed {{as important in}} shaping the population dynamics of these species was investigated. These included rodent diet and habitat use, and the roles of food availability and predation pressure. Changes in rodent population dynamics were investigated using three relative density estimates: footprint tracking tunnels; and two kill trapping indices. Tracking tunnels gave reliable density estimates, but were influenced by sampling effort and habitat type. Rats had an opportunistic, omnivorous diet, and had no measurable detrimental effects of stomach parasite infection. Rats were generally more common in forest with the most food, but became equally abundant in all areas following widespread synchronous <b>tree</b> <b>seeding.</b> Rats were more numerous in areas with predators removed. Mice were found in all areas following Nothofagus seeding. Mice became scarce as food levels dropped, suggesting that the forest habitat does not contain enough food to support them in most years. The roles of food limitation and predation in shaping rodent population dynamics were investigated initially by computer modelling. The model showed that predators could not prevent a rodent population eruption, nor limit peak prey-population density. However, predation may be important during the decline and low phases of the eruption. The predictions of the model were tested in a large-scale field experiment. Predators were removed from a 750 ha peninsula in the study area. Rodent population dynamics during an eruption were compared in large areas with and without predators present. Predators did not prevent a prey eruption or limit peak population size as predicted by the computer model. There was evidence that predators limited prey populations during the post-eruption low phase, but the role of predation during the rodent decline remains unclear. Thus, the eruptive population dynamics of mice and rats in forest ecosystems in New Zealand are driven primarily by spatial and temporal variation in food supply, with predation by a single common predator potentially important during the crash and low phases following a population eruption...|$|E

In this study we used data collected by the Orongorongo valley near Wellington between August 1971 and November 1996. We used three ecosystem measures: mouse population size, mouse breeding and seed fall and compared graphical models among seasons. Mice population size was estimated from counts in mice traps adjusted for trapping-effort. Beech seed fall was measured using seed traps under mature trees. Mouse breeding was measured by the proportion of mice caught in traps that were pregnant females and the proportion of adult males in the population. Direct assessment of seasonal effects on micebeech forest ecosystem relationships was by comparison among seasonal-models. Separate graphical models were produced, one for each leading season: a model with spring as the most recent time, a model with autumn as the most recent time, and so on. The seasonal-graphical models were helpful in understanding the relationship among variables. The winter observed mouse numbers are dependent on the numbers in the previous season, autumn, and on levels of seed fall. Similarly summer mouse numbers are dependent on the size of the population in the previous season, spring. There was no direct link with seed fall as there was with the size of the previous winter’s mouse population. The number of mice in spring was related to mice numbers in the winter before. All these relationships are positive, i. e., with an increase in mouse numbers in winter, mouse numbers in spring will increase. Graphical models for time series can be used for a wide range of environmental studies. The complexity of ecosystem interactions can be described by modelling the multivariate system with graphical links for the changing interactions through time. Comparison among models for different seasons, or for periods pre- and postperturbation can be used for quantifying temporal change...|$|E

Moreover, a direct link between climate and NE incidence is found. High summer and autumn temperatures, 2 years and 1 year respectively before NE occurrence, relate to high NE incidence. This enables early forecasting of NE outbreaks. Since future climate change scenarios predict higher temperatures in Europe, we should regard Puumala virus as an increasing health threat...|$|R
