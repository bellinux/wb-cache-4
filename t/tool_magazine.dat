40|$|The Dutch {{institute}} of applied physics of TNO and the Institute of Metals TNO (Apeldoorn) have installed a {{flexible manufacturing system}} (FMS). The main components of this FMS are a turret lathe, a machining centre and a transport system. One of the objectives of this system is to produce a wide variety of parts in small batches. Several interesting (short term) planning and scheduling problems arise from this objective. Among others, (1) which orders should be processed in a certain period, and (2) in what sequence should the selected orders be processed. In solving these problems, one has to take into account due dates, process plans (routing), capacities of the machines and the <b>tool</b> <b>magazines,</b> <b>tool</b> and jaw changing times, limited fixturing capacity, fixturing and clamping times and the limited number of operators and transport devices.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} a tool switching problem arising {{in certain}} flexible manufacturing environments. A batch of jobs {{have to be}} successively processed on a single flexible machine. Each job requires a subset of tools, which have {{to be placed in}} the <b>tool</b> <b>magazine</b> of the machine before the job can be processed. The <b>tool</b> <b>magazine</b> has a limited capacity, and, in general, the number of tools needed to produce all the jobs exceeds this capacity.

After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC), milling machines evolved into machining centers (milling machines with automatic <b>tool</b> changers, <b>tool</b> <b>magazines</b> or carousels, CNC control, coolant systems, and enclosures), generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) and horizontal machining centers (HMCs). The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A set of jobs can be {{processed}} without interruption by a flexible machine {{only if the}} set of tools required by all jobs can be loaded in the <b>tool</b> <b>magazine.</b> However, in practice {{the total number of}} tools required by a job set would exceed the <b>tool</b> <b>magazine</b> capacity.

In this paper, we study job sequencing rules that allow us to minimize the total expected cost of machine down time due to machine failures and magazine retooling, assuming a dynamic re-sequencing of the unprocessed jobs after each machine failure.

40|$|A {{flexible}} manufacturing system consists {{of a number of}} NC-machines, linked by automated material handling devices, that perform the various operations required to manufacture parts. Each operation requires different tools. These tools are stored in a limited capacity <b>tool</b> <b>magazine</b> attached to each machine. When it becomes necessary to add or remove tools from the <b>tool</b> <b>magazine,</b> the machine may have to be shut down for a setup. In this paper, we study a model which aims at minimizing the number of setups. We assume that N jobs must be processed on a machine. Each job requires a certain set of tools, which have to be present in the <b>tool</b> <b>magazine</b> of the machine when the job is executed. The magazine has a total capacity of C tools. We say that a group (subset, batch) of jobs is feasible if, together, these jobs do not require more than C tools. The job grouping problem is to partition the jobs into a minimum number of feasible groups. The problem can be formulated as a set covering problem. We solve the linear relaxation of this formulation in order to obtain tight lower bounds. Since the number of variables is potentially huge, we use a column generation approach. The column generation subproblem turns out to be NP-hard; we solve it by enumeration. We also describe some fast and simple heuristics for the job grouping problem. The result of our computational experiments is that the lower bound is extremely strong. The quality of the heuristic solutions is in general very good too. We also investigate a more general multiple-machine model in which each tool may occupy several slots in the tool magazines. Peer reviewe...|$|E

In the second phase (Phase II), demand is divided into batches again and operations are assigned to machines based on their workload and <b>tool</b> <b>magazine</b> capacity defined by Longest Processing Time (LPT) and Multifit algorithms. In Phase II, like Phase I, partial grouping is more effective in balancing the workload than total grouping. In partial grouping, each machine is tooled differently, but they can assist one another in processing each individual operation. Phase I demonstrates the efficiency of allocating operations to each group. Phase II demonstrates the efficiency of allocating operations to each machine within each group. This two-phase solution enhances routing flexibility with the same or {{a smaller number of}} machines through partial grouping rather than through total grouping. This partial grouping provides a balanced solution for problems involving a large number of machines.

40|$|A {{group of}} {{identical}} NC machines, {{laid out in}} a line, manufactures relatively few part types in large batch size. Parts of the same type are processed by the machines simultaneously. The operations on a part are performed by one machine only, using a part type specific tool set. During batch production the <b>tool</b> <b>magazines</b> of the machines contain the same set of tools. If the machine group is provided with an automatic tool transport system then tools can be shared. Therefore, the number of identical tools can be reduced and savings with respect to investment in tools are possible. A disadvantage of tool sharing is that machines might become idle because tools have not arrived in time. Suitable dispatching and scheduling of the tool transportation device can reduce these machine waiting times. In this paper the characteristics of the production situation are examined. The consequences of three tool transport policies with respect to transport time and transport frequency of the transportation device are analyzed.

Analysis and modeling of flexible manufacturing system (FMS) includes priority analysis of machining jobs and machining routing for efficient profit and production. Flexible manufacturing system (FMS) job Priority calculation becomes exceptionally complex {{when it comes to}} contain frequent variations in the part designs of incoming jobs. This paper focuses on priority analysis of variety of incoming jobs into the system efficiently and maximizing system utilization and throughput of system where machines are equipped with different <b>tools</b> and <b>tool</b> <b>magazines</b> but multiple machines can be assigned to single operation. For the complete analysis of the proposed work, a cloud of four incoming jobs have been considered. The Jobs have been assigned the priority according to Slack per Remaining Operations. Usually the probability of incoming job priority is calculated based on three parameters based strategy. In this work an adaptive Neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed to calculate the priority of incoming jobs based on Slack per Remaining Operations (S/RO) parameter. Four horizontal CNC lathe machines have been utilized for this work. Therefore, in this paper, an ANFIS system is developed to generate best priority of incoming jobs. The results obtained clearly indicate the higher efficiency of the proposed work to decide the priority of the incoming jobs...|$|R
