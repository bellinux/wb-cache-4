In other words, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> {{accounted}} for about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns because <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> continues operations even during recessions. Many organizations such as law firms, independent contractors (both defense and civilian), non-profit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near D.C. {{to be close to}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Tenth Amendment {{reinforces}} {{the principles of}} separation of powers and federalism by providing that powers not granted to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states or the people.

5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E

5|$|If {{the federal}} {{property}} is an enclave, then <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded {{the land to}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He called on <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> {{to take full}} responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties {{to pay for these}} programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E

5|$|The {{applicability}} {{of state and}} municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a federal enclave, what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> and whether the law is criminal or civil. If the federal property is not an enclave, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> either has concurrent jurisdiction (shared authority with the state) or proprietary jurisdiction (only the rights of a landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.|$|E
