5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

500|$|The {{gestation}} of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, {{was only}} slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with [...] "A Career" [...] as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: [...] "'At the Store' {{is a tribute to}} the women who have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.|$|E

500|$|Saville {{evaluated}} the ambitious Radar Fence Plan of Major General Francis L. Ankenbrandt, which had recently failed in Congress {{because it was}} too expensive in manpower and material, and would take too long to put in place. Fairchild and Saville determined to devise a more practical radar defense plan, one that would bypass the slow approval methods previously established. In pushing his plan to fruition, Saville angered other officers who expected to have a say in air defense; he said, [...] "I wasn't going <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> and wait." [...] He first focused on a foundation of radar systems, and concluded that the U.S. should spend $116million in 1949 and 1950, to build 75 radar sites and 20 control centers in the continental U.S., with 10 more radar sites facing the Soviet Union from the Territory of Alaska, controlled through a territorial center. The radar sites would primarily be composed of older World War II-era microwave units, but these would be augmented by a few advanced radar units, carefully positioned. Dubbed the [...] "Lashup" [...] plan (from [...] "lash-up", meaning [...] "hastily improvised"), it was about 20% of the cost of Ankenbrandt's Radar Fence Plan, and it was more flexible in terms of future expansion.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the state}} convention, Handley {{ran for the}} {{nomination}} {{to run for governor}} with the backing of Senator Jenner. Although Craig tried to block his nomination, Handley was able to overcome his opposition and win the nomination. In the general election his opponent was Democrat Ralph Tucker. The central election issues was the bribery scandal, the impending state budget deficit, and reform of the state health institutions. Handley also repudiated past governors who had taken federal grant money for selling out control of the state to the federal government. He said [...] "Hoosiers refuse <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> in front of the treasury in Washington with tin cups in their hands," [...] and that depending on the federal government for revenue would lead to the ruin of the state. President Eisenhower was running for re-election in the same year, and again thanks in part to his popularity, Handley won a second landslide victory, defeating Tucker by 227,475 votes.|$|E

On their way, {{thousands}} of them gathered {{at a place called}} Jathibhanga for the onward journey. Soon after their arrival, the local collaborator blocked their exit routes out of Jathibhanga and intimated the Pakistani Army. The Hindu men were led in a procession towards the Jathibhanga grounds. The Pakistani army who had by then arrived in two military trucks, forced the fleeing Hindus <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> and burst fired them using machine guns. The killing spree started in the morning and went on till afternoon. After the military left, the collaborators moved the corpses to near the Pathraj river and covered them with earth.|$|R

He, too, resented this senseless demand of civilization as an indignity to their Olympian loves. And he was a man to chafe at all restraints. But at last the odious thing was over, grim and implacable Law satisfied after he had compelled them <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for an interminable period before his grill, and mingle with those whom he chose, in his ignorance, to call their peers. Honora felt degraded as they emerged with the hateful paper, bought at such a price. The City Hall Park, with its moving streams of people, etched itself in her memory.|$|E

In Anderson’s narrative he describes this master as “one of those cunning, fox-like slaveholders.” Next he was brought to a slave market and sold to a southern trader. The trader then on November 6, 1826, tied together sixty to seventy slaves, Anderson included, and made them walk from Eastern to Western Tennessee. The journey took a total of two months. While William and the other slaves walked they sang “Farewell, ye children of the Lord”.

50|$|On 17 September, the Razakars {{arrived at}} the dead {{of the night in}} country boats and encircled the entire village. On the early morning of 18 September between 4 AM and 5 AM, a group of Pakistani {{soldiers}} arrived at Krishnapur from Astagram camp in Kishoreganj. The Pakistani contingent arrived in two speedboats in two groups. One group of soldiers alighted from the boat and started firing indiscriminately as they entered the village. The other group patrolled around the village the speedboat. At this time, the Razakars too began to fire as they entered the village and started looting. They went from door to door and robbed the villagers of their cash and jewellery at gunpoint. The Pakistani soldiers, incited by the Razakars, set fire to all the houses of the village. Then they rounded up 130 men in front of the Kamalamayee High School. The men were made <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> a <b>line</b> and burst fired. Pramod Ray, Nabadwip Ray and Haridas Ray survived with bullet wounds after being shot. They were handicapped {{for the rest of their}} lives.In the Chandipur locality, there were only 16 families. In Chandipur, all the residents were made <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> a <b>line</b> and burst fired. 45 Hindus were killed. Only two persons survived the massacre. In Lalchanpur locality, 40 Hindus were rounded up in the residence of Madhu Namashudra. After robbing all their cash, they were made <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> a <b>line</b> and burst fired to death. Hindus were similarly shot dead in Gokulnagar.|$|R
