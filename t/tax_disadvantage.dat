40|$|Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) {{are unique}} {{in that they are}} in-flation-indexed, default risk-free bonds. However, TIPS are not free from all risk — they are still subject to {{liquidity}} risk (due to a thin secondary market) and <b>tax</b> <b>disadvantage</b> risk (due a specific tax liability in their cash flows). In this thesis, I demonstrate through various empirical models that liquidity and <b>tax</b> <b>disadvantage</b> premia are priced into TIPS yields in order to compen-sate for these risks. I determine that since mid- 2004 the TIPS liquidity pre-mium is relatively stable and averages 27 bp. My results also weakly support a time-variant TIPS <b>tax</b> <b>disadvantage</b> premium that averages 56 bp over the same time period. Furthermore, I find that these two premia are principally driven by the uncertain volatility of expected future inflation. Consequently, {{as a result of these}} premia, it is on average 3 bp more expensive for the Trea-sury to issue a TIPS rather than a conventional nominal bond, which has cost the Treasury over $ 221 million. So why does the Treasury continue to issue TIPS if they do not in fact lower borrowing costs, as was the intention of the program? It is possible that TIPS offer several nonmarketable public benefits that offset their additional cost, thus making the program worthwhile for the Treasury and market participants alike...|$|E

Although the market has observed less funding since the most recent economic crisis and there have been fewer players in the market during the economic recovery, there are still new participants who are poised to enter the {{secondary market}}.

The mortality unlocking approach used in the proposed dynamic valuation also serves as the basis for a proposed reinsurance strategy which can be used to improve the tail risk protection for a portfolio.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{equity and}} debt securitisation in Germany {{and its implications}} for the property industry. Based on the current market environment the key drivers of change that will lead to an increase in equity and debt securitisation {{within the next five years}} are discussed. Furthermore, the crucial legal requirements and restrictions that will determine the future success of German real estate securitisation are identified. In terms of real estate investment, Germany is the biggest market in Europe. Nevertheless, the total securitised real estate equity has only been € 7 billion as of August 2005. It is broadly anticipated that the introduction of REITs in Germany will promote a fast expansion of the listed property sector. Particularly by eliminating the current <b>tax</b> <b>disadvantages</b> and by providing corporates and private equity investors with an attractive exit vehicle for their property portfolios. On the debt side, 70 % of all German real estate is funded through the use of traditional bank loans. Apart from synthetic debt securitisation structures and the German Pfandbrief market, which exceeds a volume of over € 1 trillion, international capital market instruments have not yet been established. However, recent changes in the German legal landscape have opened the door for true-sale securitisation deals. The advantages of true-sale transactions, such as higher LTVs, will determine the significant expected growth in the German real estate debt securitisation market. – 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the relative valuation of dividends and capital {{gains in the}} Finnish stock market in 1960 - 1985. Stock prices fell on ex-dividend days by less than Ihe amount of dividend implying that investors faced lower marginal tax rates on capital gains than on dividend income. It is, however, the total tox liability {{of the company and}} the shareholder together that should be used to infer market preference for dividends or capital gains. Using the estimation results of our ex-dividend analysis and estimates of corporate tax rates on retained and distributed profit we find that investors have shifted from capital gains preference to dividend preference.

40|$|Out {{of their}} after-tax profits, {{corporations}} pay dividends and often repurchase shares to generate capital gains for their shareholders. Capital gains typically attract lower effective {{rates of tax}} than dividends, {{which leads to the}} payout puzzle: Why do corporations continue to pay dividends in spite of their relative <b>tax</b> <b>disadvantage?</b> This paper develops a model of corporate payout policy to explain some aspects of the puzzle. The key element of the model is the lock-in effect caused by the fact that capital gains are taxed only upon realization, which implies that taxpayers can reduce the effective rate of tax by postponing realizations, i. e., by locking in accrued capital gains. Shareholders with an accrued capital gain, thus, would require a lock-in premium to compensate them for their higher tax liability resulting from the sale. This premium is an increasing function of accrued capital gains and the desired holding period for equity. In this setting firms pay dividends in equilibrium whenever the lock-in premium is high relative to the <b>tax</b> <b>disadvantage</b> of dividend payments. It follows that firms with a relatively high proportion of shareholders with sizable capital gains and/or long holding periods face higher repurchasing costs and are thus more likely to pay dividends. The model predicts that total payout increases as the capital gains tax and the profits tax increase, whereas the dividend tax has no effect. The model’s predictions are examined empirically using data from a panel of Canadian corporations listed on the TSX over the period 1987 - 2008. The empirical results, being largely consistent with those of the model, are encouraging.
