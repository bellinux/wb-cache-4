5000|$|In Russia, <b>window</b> <b>tinting</b> {{limits are}} {{specified}} in GOST 5727-88. The limit is 75% {{for the front}} windshield (a darker stripe no wider than 10 cm is allowed at the very top) and 70% for the front side <b>windows.</b> <b>Tinting</b> of back <b>windows</b> is not regulated. In practice, however, bribes are often used to pass inspection or avoid road police tickets even with illegal tint.|$|R

Principal component {{analysis showed that}} samples cluster by both groups of supplier and individual samples, indicating good reproducibility and sample separation. <b>Window</b> <b>tint</b> samples could betraced back {{to one of three}} countries of manufacture; Australia, America and Isreal; suggesting that different suppliers are sourcing their samples from the same manufacturer. This indicates the potential for <b>window</b> <b>tint</b> to be used as forensic evidence, as samples are able to be compared on a questioned versus known basis due to the variation in the sources...|$|R

500|$|According to reports, {{the group}} had been eating and {{drinking}} together and [...] "having a party" [...] earlier in the day. Although the charter bus which Ram Singh drove on weekdays was not permitted to pick up public passengers or even to operate in Delhi because of its <b>tinted</b> <b>windows,</b> they decided {{to take it out}} [...] "to have some fun". A few hours before committing the gang rape, the attackers had robbed a carpenter. The carpenter was 35-years old Ram Adhar who boarded the bus which was being driven by Mukesh Singh. The juvenile convict had lured him into the bus saying it was going to Nehru Place. He was then beaten up, robbed of his cellphone and 1500 in cash. After robbing him, the group dumped him at the IIT Flyover. Ram reported about the group in the bus robbing him to three police constables Kailash, Ashok and Sandeep who were passing nearby. They however refused to take action saying that the crime scene wasn't under their purview as they were from the Hauz Khas police station and he will have to report the incident to the Vasant Vihar police station.|$|E
50|$|Both {{solar and}} wind have been criticized from an {{aesthetic}} point of view. However, methods and opportunities exist to deploy these renewable technologies efficiently and unobtrusively: fixed solar collectors can double as noise barriers along highways, and extensive roadway, parking lot, and roof-top area is currently available; amorphous photovoltaic cells {{can also be used}} to <b>tint</b> <b>windows</b> and produce energy. Advocates of renewable energy also argue that current infrastructure is less aesthetically pleasing than alternatives, but sited further from the view of most critics.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the implications for night driving of a proposal put forward by a <b>window</b> <b>tinting</b> lobby group to reduce the required minimum visible light transmittance (VLT) of front side windows of cars from 70 % to 35 %. A sample of 24 young (aged under 30 years) and 24 elderly (aged 59 or over) subjects were required to complete target detection and reaction time tasks using peripheral vision. These tasks were performed both through a clear or <b>tinted</b> front side <b>window</b> and both in the presence and absence of a concurrent visual tracking task performed on a computer screen {{directly in front of the}} subject. The contrast value of the targets to be detected also took two different values. It was found that the elderly performed worse on the task overall, producing 178 of the 179 target detection failures in the study and also registering longer reaction times than the young group. Reaction times recorded for the elderly group were also found to be longer when they were required to view the targets through the <b>tinted</b> <b>window.</b> Similar effects were found for the elderly resulting from the dual task manipulation (longer reaction times when performing the concurrent task) and from the target contrast manipulation (longer reaction times when reacting to the low contrast target). As this study was very conservative in nature, it is concluded on the basis of significantly longer reaction times for the elderly subjects when looking through the <b>tinted</b> <b>window</b> that industry pressure to lower the minimum VLT of front side windows should be resisted and that these windows should be required to allow 70 % of incident visual light to pass through to the eyes of the driver.
