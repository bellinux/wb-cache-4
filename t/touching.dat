50|$|The Österreichischer <b>Touch</b> Verband (<b>Touch</b> Austria Association) {{became an}} {{associate}} member of F.I.T (Federation International <b>Touch)</b> in October 2009 with 3 official member clubs (<b>Touch</b> Rugby Vienna, ACC <b>Touch,</b> <b>Touch</b> Voralberg). 2009 saw {{the establishment of}} the Austrian <b>Touch</b> League (ATL) plus the first ever national <b>Touch</b> teams (Mixed and Men's) that competed in the 2009 Mainland Cup. <b>Touch</b> Austria also sends teams to contest regular events in other tournaments in Europe.|$|R
30|$|In the {{application}} of this approach, the dynamical occlusion area cannot be applied without unintended <b>touches.</b> Tush, the first <b>touch</b> offers one especially difficult situation. When a first <b>touch</b> and a second <b>touch</b> occur one by one, and the first <b>touch</b> is recognized as an intended <b>touch</b> before the second <b>touch</b> occurs. Then the first <b>touch</b> will immediately draw an ink stroke. However, there will be three possible cases.|$|R

50|$|As fine <b>touch</b> {{normally}} {{works in}} parallel to crude <b>touch,</b> a person {{will be able}} to localize <b>touch</b> until fibres carrying fine <b>touch</b> (Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway) have been disrupted. Then the subject will feel the <b>touch,</b> but be unable to identify where they were <b>touched.</b>|$|R

30|$|Several {{researches}} for the multi-touch interactions [14 – 16] {{attempt to}} recognize finger <b>touches.</b> Current capacitive <b>touch</b> devices can correctly receive all <b>touches,</b> but {{still have a}} difficulty in classifying which <b>touches</b> are intended and which <b>touches</b> are not.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (<b>touching).</b> Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two <b>touching</b> circles in two places. Upon inversion, the <b>touching</b> circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by <b>touching</b> {{something that has}} droplets on it and then <b>touching</b> the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Fine <b>touch</b> (or discriminative <b>touch)</b> is a sensory {{modality}} {{that allows}} a subject to sense and localize <b>touch.</b> The form of <b>touch</b> where localization is not possible is known as crude <b>touch.</b> The posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway is the pathway responsible for the sending of fine <b>touch</b> information to the cerebral cortex of the brain.|$|R

5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and <b>touching</b> his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, <b>touching</b> his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
50|$|<b>Touch</b> typing (also called <b>touch</b> type or <b>touch</b> keyboarding) is typing {{without using}} {{the sense of}} sight to find the keys. Specifically, a <b>touch</b> typist will know their {{location}} on the keyboard through muscle memory. <b>Touch</b> typing typically involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along {{the middle of the}} keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for other keys. Both two-handed <b>touch</b> typing and one-handed <b>touch</b> typing are possible.|$|R

40|$|Counselor {{initiated}} <b>touch</b> {{in therapy}} {{is a much}} debated topic. Yet {{there is a growing}} consensus about the positive effects of therapeutic <b>touch</b> while acknowledging that when used inconsiderately <b>touch</b> can harm clients. 61 counselors and therapists completed a questionnaire about attitudes toward <b>touch</b> in therapy and the frequency of <b>touch</b> use. Most counselors believed that non-erotic and ethical <b>touch</b> had positive effects on clients. There was a significant main effect of therapist gender on attitudes towards <b>touch,</b> F(1, 57) = 9. 05, p<. 003, and frequency of <b>touch</b> use, F(1, 57) = 6. 4, p <. 05. Female therapists had more positive attitudes toward <b>touch</b> and were more likely to use <b>touch</b> in therapy as compared to male counselors. The paper calls for an open discussion among therapeutic community about the benefits and possible negative effects of <b>touch</b> in a therapeutic relationship...|$|R

5|$|Bughouse {{is usually}} played using clock move, which allows <b>touching</b> of pieces. A move is {{completed}} {{only when the}} clock is pressed. Touch move is practiced to a lesser extent.

30|$|Case one is {{that the}} first <b>touch</b> was truly {{intended}} and the second <b>touch</b> was unintended. Case two is that the first <b>touch</b> was unintended and the second <b>touch</b> was intended. And case three is that both the first <b>touch</b> and the second <b>touch</b> were unintended. In both case two and three, the unintended drawn ink stroke should be removed. Therefore, to minimize the occurrences of IDIR, we embed a function that invokes DIR only for the first <b>touch.</b>|$|R

5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the <b>touching</b> of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very <b>touching,</b> and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the detection of}} multiple <b>touch</b> points for capacitive <b>touch</b> panel systems under Gaussian noise. We propose an algorithm that reduces the noise-induced detection error and improves the detection accuracy with partial <b>touch</b> signal information. The proposed algorithm {{is based on the}} likelihood ratio test, and utilizes the <b>touch</b> signal features, such as the local maximum, the range of <b>touch</b> magnitude, and the consecutive occurrence of <b>touch</b> locations, to first detect <b>touch</b> points and then calculates the real <b>touch</b> coordinates based on the weighting average technique. Simulation demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed algorithm. I...|$|R
