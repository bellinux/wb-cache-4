40|$|Ink {{spreading}} {{and lateral}} light scattering in the substrate affect {{the color of}} a halftone print. One of the most important phenomena which affects the print result is dot gain, meaning that printed dots appear larger than the dots in the digital bitmap. This is partly due to the ink spreading and ink penetration into the substrate, resulting in an enhancement of the physical dot size, referred to as the physical dot gain. Lateral propagation of light in paper causes printed dots to appear larger than their physical size, which is called optical dot gain. Characterization of total dot gain, i. e. the combination of physical and optical dot gain, is an important issue in the study of paper properties and print characteristics. Many models based on macroscopic measurements are reported in the  literature to separately characterize both physical and optical dot gains. The aim {{of this study is to}} go beyond the macroscopic models, and to study the halftone prints on a microscopic scale, by using microscale images captured by a high-resolution camera. In this dissertation, three approaches based on the Murray-Davies model are proposed to obtain the total dot gain. In the first approach, by minimizing the root-mean-square difference between the calculated spectrum and the reflected spectrum measured by the  spectrophotometer, the total dot gain is approximated. The other two approaches are based on microscale images captured by a highresolution camera. These two approaches differ in their schemes on how to obtain the gray tone of the full <b>tone</b> <b>ink.</b> By the use of microscale images, it is also possible to illustrate the shape of the effective dot area for the investigated paper substrate. A novel approach based on the histogram of microscale images is also proposed to separate physical from optical dot gain. Attaining the physical dot gain characteristic makes it possible to determine the actual physical dot shape, by which the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the paper substrate is estimated. The proposed approach is validated by comparing the estimated MTF of eleven offset printed coated papers to the MTF obtained from the unprinted papers using measured and Monte-Carlo simulated edge response. Another potential usage based on the separation of physical from optical dot gain, is to study the characterization of different color inks. In this dissertation, the dependency of dot gain and wavelength in color print is investigated. It has been illustrated that the light scattering effect, which is the reason for optical dot gain creation, must be less sensitive to different wavelength bands. It has also been shown that it is possible to separate two printed color inks by illuminating the halftone print with having light in the reflective wavelength band of one of the two colors. Comparison of the optical dot gain for different dot shapes and perimeters, but with the same area, shows the dependency of optical dot gain on the dot shape perimeter. The dependency of optical dot gain on the dot shape perimeter verifies the fact that the amount of optical dot gain is different for different types of halftoning...|$|R

40|$|Driography is a planographic {{printing}} process. A driographic printing plate differs from a conventional offset lithographic plate in that water {{is not required}} to keep the non-image area clean of ink during printing. Water, or fountain solution, is not required during printing because a silicone rubber coating which repels ink is used for the non-image area of a driographic plate. The first driographic plate was introduced in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s by the 3 M Company. The plate was a positive working printing plate and has since been discontinued. Driography has since been researched by a number of companies but only one is presently marketing a driographic plate. The Toray Company, a Japanese based firm, is producing a negative working driographic printing plate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research Toray 2 ̆ 7 s negative working driographic printing plate. It is hypothesized that as <b>ink</b> tack decreases, <b>toning</b> in the non-image area will increase. In this experiment, ink tack was monitored at the point of impression using a thermocouple device. The thermocouple was used to measure ink temperature on an inking form roller. Temperature/tack curves were developed and used to convert ink temperatures to tack readings. The actual experiment was performed on a duplicator offset printing press. A second technique using ink tack-reducer to alter ink tack was performed as an alternative test to support the initial method results. During the course of the study a number of variables could have altered the test results. These variables were monitored and kept constant during testing.

50|$|Taihang is an {{isolated}} region of dense cloud forests punctuated by jagged peaks. These unique geographical characteristics made the region particularly suited to Jing's developing interest in ink wash techniques. Jing {{was one of}} the earliest Chinese artists to employ ink washes (yongmo) to simulate depth and atmospheric perspective. Building on the approach initially pioneered by Tang painters such as Xiang Rong, Jing wrote that the principal aim of the yongmo technique was to “distinguish higher and lower of objects with a gradation in <b>ink</b> <b>tones,</b> and represent clearly shallowness and depth, making them appear natural as if they had not been done with a brush.” Of Xiang himself, Jing wrote that the earlier artist had “attained the secret of mysterious truth only through the use of ink wash”, but criticized Xiang for his lack of definition, lamenting that Xiang had “no bone in his brushwork”. Jing departed from such an approach by employing in his landscapes a mixture of atmospheric ink washes and bold brush strokes to accurately transcribe the Shanxi landscapes in which he worked. This technique, called cun fa, would characterize all of his major works {{as well as those of}} other artists who would study his work in later years.|$|R
40|$|Digital data is {{the driving}} force behind much of our modern technology. The Internet and {{cellular}} phones are ubiquitous examples of the need to handle information accurately, efficiently, and robustly. The fact that digital signals and data sets can be processed with great precision and speed places high demands on providing accurate conversion between the analog and digital worlds. However, the technology used in the analog to digital (A/D) conversion by necessity involves analog devices which have physical limitations that, at first sight, conflict with these accuracy demands. For example, typical printers are only capable of applying a very limited set of <b>ink</b> <b>tones</b> (which may be as small as a single black tone) to paper for rendering intermediate grayscale levels. Similarly, in audio applications, the inaccuracy of analog circuits in working with binary expansions is a problem that routinely needs to be addressed. To cope with these problems, engineers have empirically developed special signal processing techniques leading to alternative signal and number representations that are quite different from the standard decimal or binary representations. Typical techniques take advantage of the fact that, although most analog devices used in A/D conversion fail to provide high precision in the amplitude domain, many of them are capable of sampling very densely in the time or the space domain over which the signals are defined. In these techniques, judiciously chosen dense arrangements of a limited set of discrete amplitude values are used t...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} one of the newer planographic printing plates, specifically 3 M 2 ̆ 7 s Dry Plate. This plate is part of the system more popularly known as driography. As with many new processes, driography is beset with several problems. These include plate durability, substrate suitability, and toning. This study deals with the problem of toning and a. method for investigating it. In driography, toning is defined as the inking of the non-image background of the plate. Several factors are thought to {{have an effect on the}} amount of toning. Factors such as ink tack, ink temperature, room temperature, humidity, speed, and pressure are included. This investigation specifically researched the relationships between <b>toning</b> and <b>ink</b> tack, inking pressure, and printing speed. A parallel study of these relationships was made on both an IGT Printability Tester and on an ATF Chief 15 press. This was done in an attempt to show that the IGT Printability Tester could print driographically but, under the conditions used, it was a poor predictor of toning. Two methods of recording the effects of toning were used. One method was the recording of absolute densities taken in the non-image areas of the test sheets. The other method was the recording of a. ratio of the density of a solid patch to the density- of a tinted patch. It was hoped that the ratio would eliminate some of the extraneous variables that might affect the amount of toning. It was found, however, that the ratio result tended to record not only the pure toning, but also, the effects of some of the extraneous variables. Several statistical methods v/ere used to analyze the data accumulated. To compare one printing method with another and to compare one recording method with another, a correlation analysis was made and a graphical study done. To determine the reliability of the graphical analysis, a spot check was made using a paired comparison technique. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was made of the data from each printing and recording method to determine the significant factors in the experiment. This experiment showed that ink tack, inking pressure, printing speed, and their interactions all were significant factors in toning. Unfortunately it was impossible to include some other factors in the experiment which are known to have a significant effect on toning. These include such factors as ink temperature, room temperature, and humidity. More work needs to be done in the area of driography, especially in toning. The crucial question is whether this is a plate or an ink problem. As more control is obtained over toning, the use of driography should increase...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the {{development}} of Songjiang School {{in the context of}} mutual interaction and networking among painters. It focuses on two phenomena. Firstly, it studies the interaction between Songjiang School painters and artists from various Jiangnan art centres. Secondly, it explores the artistic genealogy within the Songjiang School. It investigates the activities of individual Songjian School painters in particular, and the rise and decline of the entire Songjiang School in general. Under the famous master literati Dong Qichang, Songjiang School painters broke new path in landscape painting, valuing moist <b>ink</b> <b>tones</b> at the expense of brush and ink. But even before Dong, Gu Zhenyi and Mo Shilong were already well known for their efforts in exploring new styles. Supported by brilliant art talent such as Chen Jiru, Zhao Zuo and Shen Shicong, Dong Qichang brought the Songjiang School to its zenith. However, it was also Dong Qichang who dug the grave for the School. As Dong's followers were mostly professional painters, they could not stand as equals to Literati connoisseurs. Some became Dong Qichang's ghost-painters at the expense of their artistic individuality, whereas others were trapped in {{the lower end of the}} art market. Consequently, the Songjiang School lost its vigor and prestige in the Qing dynasty. Only Dong Qichang, the leading master of the School, could dominate the literati painting scene. With its economy revived after the suppression of the wako invasion in late Jiajing period (1522 - 1566), Songjiang quickly reassumed its dominant position in the art scene. Songjiang School painters became very self-conscious and proud of their own hometown. They succeeded in networking with connoisseurs in Zhejiang and Huizhou, and learning valuable lessons from the works of their Suzhou counterparts. Consequently, although both the Wu (Suzhou) and Songjiang Schools were descendents of the same literati painting tradition, the Songjiang School loomed large throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The social prestige of some Songjiang literati certainly enhanced the success of the School. 徐麗莎. 呈交日期: 2005 年 8 月. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2005. 參考文獻(p. i-x (2 nd group)).

40|$|Linting is {{considered}} to be a major print quality problem. It is defined as the removal of fibres and fines from the surface of uncoated paper during offset printing. The accumulation of lint on the blanket will eventually reduce the print quality and affect the pressroom efficiency. Although linting has been studied for many years, no measurement methods for characterizing lint have been standardized. Several major factors that contribute to the complexity in lint measurements are the very small amount of lint that is being removed from the paper surface, the interactions between different variables affecting linting and the lack of understanding on the dynamics of linting during printing. This work is focused on four main parts, which explore the dynamic measurement of linting. In the first part, Weibull statistics have been used to characterize the distribution of adhesion strength of lint particles to paper. Static tests were conducted to measure lint dynamics by repeatedly stopping the press during a run, washing and collecting multiple lint samples from different areas of the blanket. The effect of a change in the size distribution of lint particles with increasing number of copies was examined, in order to estimate relative removal from the blanket as a function of lint particle size. From the analysis, the removal rate of lint particles from the paper decreased with the increasing size of particles. Differences in the bond strength of the lint particle size to the paper substrate were suggested to be responsible for the change. The removal rate of particles from the printing blanket was found to be independent of particle size, indicating that both the adhesion force between the particles and blanket and the removal force due to ink tack are proportional to the particle area. The second part of this work presented the initial development of a dynamic lint measurement technique using a high speed video camera, together with image analysis, to measure the accumulation of lint on the blanket. The area distribution of lint measured from the lint camera was compared to the area distribution measured by washing the blanket. The percentage area covered by lint in dynamic images (when the press was running) was larger than in either the static (when the press was halted) images or the filtered samples. The lint particle size distribution from the static images shows similarities to the distribution of the lint removed from the blanket in filtered samples. The differences in the lint area distribution for the dynamic images were due to the blurring of images and agglomeration of particles. These results showed that the system needs to be improved before it could be used for routine quality control tests. The third part developed the lint camera system further so that it can measure lint dynamically and reproducibly with different colour printing inks. The results of the lint camera system were also validated against other measurements of lint. The correlation between the lint camera and the blanket tape pull method was very good, while the lint measured from the washed and filtered sample gave higher percentage area distribution at small particle sizes than the area distribution measured from the lint camera. The differences in the lint area distribution from the filtered sample at small particle sizes, is likely due to disaggregation of the agglomerated lint particles during the washing and filtering, and thus large particles are being measured as more smaller size particles. When the overall lint deposited and removed from the printing blanket are in equilibrium, there was approximately 5 % to 6. 5 % variation around the measured average number of lint particles, from image to image. This was due to random deposit and removal of lint particles. The final part of the work discussed the effects of the paper and of the printing press variables of printing <b>tone</b> and <b>ink</b> tack on the two rates of adhesion failure in linting, by using the lint camera system developed in part three and also by stopping the press repeatedly to wash the lint samples off the blanket. The first failure (k₁) is for the removal of lint particles from the paper surface to the blanket, while the second failure (k₂) is for the separation of the lint particles from the blanket. The key finding of this study was that these two rates of adhesion failure are generally correlated due to the combination forces of the free ink film, porous film flow in the printing nip and the ink film splitting force. The results showed that improved newsprint produced higher lint than standard newsprint for both small and large particles. The lowest tone of 20 % had the highest values of k₁ and k₂. The previous contradictory results from the literature of the maximum lint with tone are due to the different number of copies being printed when the measurements were conducted. Both k₁ and k₂ also increased with higher ink tack for small and larger particles. By conducting these studies, the dynamics of linting in offset printing can be better understood. A quality control system has been developed to measure lint migration from the paper or the printing blanket. The system also provides better correlation between paper measurements and the linting performance of paper products. Knowledge of the dynamics of linting will help paper mills and printers to assess whether the accumulation of lint on the blanket is caused by the paper or by the printing conditions...|$|R

A short step beyond desktop technology are digital printing systems, 2 ̆ 2 the culmination of many technologies that have been in various stages of development for over 20 years and have finally caught up with each other. 2 ̆ 21 Digital printers are capable of printing 2 ̆ 2 directly from digital information residing in an electronic file on a computer, 2 ̆ 22 2 ̆ 2 bypassing the multiple and time-consuming steps of film output, proofing, imposition and plate-making required by traditional methods. 2 ̆ 23 As of today, digital printing is targeted to the short-run and on-demand segments of the industry. 2 ̆ 2 Eventually, digital approaches will apply to just every facet of graphic communication, whether it has to a run of 1, 000, 000 or just one. 2 ̆ 24 Statement of The Problem The all-time myth roaming in pressrooms that designers know nothing about printing is not entirely untrue. Often, a design is finished and approved in a studio without the minimal consideration for printing and finishing. The consolidation of a digital workflow today in the printing industry increases the need for designers to acknowledge printing in their brainstorming sessions to create designs that can be produced through emerging technologies. By doing so, they can reduce problems associated with file transfer and output such as missing images and typefaces. The ease of operation of digital presses that can receive a file and print much as a desktop printer does makes them highly attractive to designers and entrepreneurs, providing these a means for printing without all the makeready procedures associated with traditional printing processes. Statement of The Project Goals The purpose of this thesis project is to evaluate the color reproduction of digital printing systems most common in industry through the creation of a universal test instrument with respect to which all the systems will be compared. The results of the test will be used to assess the capabilities of the equipment and determine their ideal applications within the graphic communications industry. A file preparation and specification guide for each of the devices tested will be compiled. The audience at which this study is targeted is graphic designers, who could benefit by learning about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various systems and learning to design with these in mind. As a result, particular attention will be paid to the impact these emerging technologies have in designers 2 ̆ 7 approach to producing their work. This thesis project does not suggest the equipment to be tested is the best in the market place. Its results, however, may be used in determining which system is most suitable for implementation. Methodology This thesis project will provide a color reproduction evaluation and comprehensive guides for designers to prepare and expedite files to the following digital presses: Xeikon DCP- 32 D Indigo E-Print 1000 Xerox DocuColor 40 Heidelberg Quickmaster-DI The criterium defining the color reproduction evaluation and the elements used in the test instrument is the following: Graphic designers, the audience at which this thesis project is targeted, think in terms of memory colors; red, green, and blue. As a result, the elements comprising the test instrument will be those which designers deal with: text and images. The printed samples will be measured with a X-Rite 938 spectrodensitometer, and the results will be complemented with a visual evaluation done under standard lighting conditions. Test Instrument The test instrument will be comprised of the following: CMYK patches and bars 4 -color black patches Images of different sources and resolutions Line art Type Overprinting circles Color bars RIT Neutral Balance Target for SWOP RIT 4 -Color Spokes Target Evaluation <b>Tone</b> reproduction Solid <b>ink</b> density Total ink density Gray balance Dot gain Resolution Ghosting The second part to this thesis project will involve the compilation of guides to expedite files to each output device. In addition, specifications will be collected to determine the requirements for preparing variable data printing documents...|$|R
