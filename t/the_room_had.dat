5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black with curves in many directions. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> black and white zebra-patterned wallpaper, {{in the style of}} New York's El Morocco club, and an indoor {{waterfall}} surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. Beyond the main bar was a smaller bar and a small showroom, and after that the club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, with its burgundy velvet wallpaper. The small front room was used for year-round lounge acts and the main showroom with supper service featured top-billed acts in the summer months and for special bookings.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the {{withdrawal}} of Bruce's bill, a ministerial by-election in Pontefract in 1872 gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Josephine attended meetings in the town. At one LNA meeting the floor of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> been liberally sprinkled with cayenne pepper by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; {{two members of the}} Metropolitan Police—specially drafted into the town for the by-election—looked on but took no action. Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, Hugh Childers, was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000). In December 1872 Josephine met the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill.|$|E

The building was constructed of non-combustible materials intended to protect the Jezreelites when the Last Trump was called and fire rained down upon the rest of existence.|$|E
25|$|The shrine {{room was}} {{situated}} in the north-west wing of the villa. Its only access point {{seems to have been}} the staircase leading from rooms on a higher terrace. During the early excavations, the walls of this room were found covered with a coat of stucco painted in panels of different colours. Niches in the north wall that probably accommodated statues and a possible altar base have led the archaeologists to suggest that <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> a religious function.|$|E
25|$|Swami Rama, a yogi {{skilled in}} {{controlling}} his heart functions, was {{studied at the}} Menninger Foundation {{in the spring and}} fall of 1970 and was alleged by some observers at the foundation to have telekinetically moved a knitting needle twice from a distance of five feet. Although Swami Rama wore a face-mask and gown to prevent allegations that he moved the needle with his breath or body movements, and air vents in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> been covered, at least one physician observer who was present at the time was not convinced and expressed the opinion that air movement was somehow the cause.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Lincoln's death in 1865, the East Room {{contained}} 24 chairs, four sofas, four tables, eight sets of drapes, eight sets of lace curtains, eight mirrors, and one carpet. All the furniture was in poor shape. During his administration, {{members of the public}} attending the weekly receptions in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> heavily vandalized the room in seeking souvenirs, ripping down portions of the wallpaper and stealing cords and tassels from the drapes. Someone even cut a square yard from one of the damask drapes. Others took scissors and knives to the carpet, gouging the oak floor beneath, and gilded ornaments were stolen from the mantels.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, she could see the side of a neighboring house and a few inches of sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|E
500|$|Until World War II, {{the club}} {{consisted}} of a dining room and bar with restrooms on upper floors with many mirrors and fresh flowers throughout. [...] Billingsley originally built the well-known Cub Room as a private place where he could play cards with friends.

500|$|Ayananka Bose was the film's cinematographer. According to Bose, its {{location}} {{was the big}} factor in his work: [...] "Dostana is based in Miami and to me Miami means sunshine and beaches. That is what stayed in my mind." [...] Bose chose a bright frame because the film was a comedy about friendship, and the bright frame conveyed vibrancy: [...] "That is what automatically gave Dostana its expression." [...] He found the office set challenging, since {{there was nowhere to}} put lights and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> glass {{on one side and a}} wall on the other. However, Bose enjoyed filming on the apartment and office sets.|$|E
500|$|Wiseau {{has said}} that while casting the film, he {{selected}} his group of actors from among [...] "thousands" [...] of head shots, yet nearly the entire cast of <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>had</b> never before been in a full-length film. For example, The Room was the first film in which Carolyn Minnott had ever appeared. Greg Sestero, who had known Wiseau for some time before production began, had limited film experience and had only agreed to work with Wiseau {{as part of the}} production crew. On the first day of filming, Wiseau fired the actor originally hired to play Mark, and Sestero agreed to fill in. He would later admit to being uncomfortable filming his sex scenes; because of this, he was allowed to keep his jeans on while shooting them.|$|E
500|$|At 3:20p.m., the {{screwdriver}} {{slipped and}} the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a [...] "prompt critical" [...] reaction and a burst of hard radiation. At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste {{in his mouth and}} an intense burning sensation in his left hand. He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation. At the time of the accident, dosimetry badges were in a locked box about [...] from the accident. Realizing that no one in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> their film badges on, [...] "immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly". This peculiar response was attributed to [...] "vertigo" [...] and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room.|$|E

500|$|McCartney later said, [...] "We lived {{backstage}} in the Bambi Kino, {{next to the}} toilets, and {{you could}} always smell them. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this pigsty. We {{were living in a}} toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E
500|$|The South Drawing Room is at {{the front}} of the house on the West Wing. In earlier times <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> served as a dining room, despite it being about as far from the kitchen as possible. This section of the house was largely remodelled under Henry Holland, but it retains its Georgian elegance today, [...] "gilded to within an inch of its life", with walls painted in a duck egg blue colour with forest green drapery and peach-patterned sofas. A large mirror with an {{exquisite}} gold frame stands between the two windows. The fireplace was added by the Chelsea stonemason Lancelot Edward Wood in 1802, and the ceiling by master builder Benjamin Broadbent of Leicester in 1865. The ceiling in the Yellow Drawing Room, also known as the Rubens Room because of its four Rubens paintings, is also attributed to Broadbent. There are numerous paintings on the walls, including fifteen Joshua Reynolds portraits and a miniature portrait in one of the alcoves of Admiral Lord Nelson, an associate of George John, Second Earl Spencer. Although Higgerson, the night watchman, guarded the place from 8 pm to 8 am, in 1954 one of the lesser valuable paintings in the South Drawing Room was stolen in the night.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926 Wittgenstein {{was again}} {{working as a}} {{gardener}} {{for a number of}} months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's Kundmanngasse. Wittgenstein, his friend Paul Engelmann, and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>had</b> the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that [...] "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty." ...|$|E
