25|$|As a {{prescription}} {{is nothing more}} than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information technology can be applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>out</b> prescriptions. Medical information systems in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using smartcard or the internet. In the United Kingdom a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.|$|E

Currently, there are thirteen faculty libraries and satellite libraries located {{in the vicinity of}} Shah Alam, Puncak Alam, Puncak Perdana and Sungai Buloh.

Opposition candidates, including Sergio Massa, Mauricio Macri and Margarita Stolbizer called for the nationwide implementation of a unified ballot and/or {{electronic voting}}, though Massa in particular was more cautious, saying it was more realistic for such a system to be implemented by 2017. The authority in charge of regulating elections rejected changing the system within 2015 since they claimed {{it would be too}} short term to implement the changes and explain to the public how the new system works.|$|E

Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of Kanons story could be summed up as [...] "the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end," [...] resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards.

[...] Each publication is {{indexed in the}} first column by its number in the Schilpp bibliography (Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientist, pp.694–730) and by its article number in Einstein's Collected Papers. [...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for cross-referencing in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present. [...] The English translations of titles are generally taken from the published volumes of the Collected Papers. [...] For some publications, however, such official translations are not available; unofficial translations are indicated with a § superscript. Although the tables are presented in chronological order by default, each table can be re-arranged in alphabetical order for any column by the reader clicking on the arrows {{at the top of}} that column. [...] For illustration, to re-order a table by subject—e.g., to group together articles that pertain to [...] "General relativity" [...] or [...] "Specific heats"—one need only click on the arrows in the [...] "Classification and Notes" [...] columns. [...] <b>To</b> <b>print</b> <b>out</b> the re-sorted table, one may print it directly by using the web-browser Print option; the [...] "Printable version" [...] link at the left gives only the default sorting.

It involved a user sitting at a computer and communicating with a remote server, answering questions. By posing questions to the user {{in a number of}} stages, enough information was gleaned from the user's answers to produce the required documents. Questions posed in the second and subsequent stages were determined from previous answers provided and the user's answers were stored in a database structure. This process was repeated until the user had provided enough information to allow the documents legally required to create the corporate entity to be generated. A number of document templates were also stored and the data processor was configured to merge {{at least one of these}} templates with the user's answers to generate the required legal documents. The documents could then be sent to the user in an electronic form for the user <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>out</b> and submit, mailed to the user, or submitted to the appropriate registration authority on behalf of the user.|$|E

Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and soil samples taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found receipts for the purchase of chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi's home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage jihad. Police also uncovered training manuals on ambush techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi's mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>out</b> a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and telephone numbers in the phone's memory. Pastika kept Amrozi's arrest secret for two days.
