Soon afterwards Zorner and his crewman had to abandon the Bf110G-4 because an engine caught fire. Zorner extinguished the fire but he could no longer calibrate the propeller pitch to a glide setting. The other power plant could not cope with the added workload and the Bf110 began to lose height. Zorner ordered his crew to leave. Zorner struggled to exit as his parachute snagged.

40|$|Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) {{are highly}} {{cytotoxic}} DNA lesions that block DNA replication and transcription by preventing strand separation. Previously, we {{demonstrated that the}} bacterial and human DNA glycosylases Nei and NEIL 1 excise unhooked psoralen-derived ICLs in three-stranded DNA via hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond between the crosslinked base and deoxyribose sugar. Furthermore, NEIL 3 from Xenopus laevis {{has been shown to}} cleave psoralen- and abasic site-induced ICLs in Xenopus egg extracts. Here we report that human NEIL 3 cleaves psoralen-induced DNA-DNA cross-links in three-stranded and four-stranded DNA substrates <b>to</b> generate <b>unhooked</b> DNA fragments containing either an abasic site or a psoralen-thymine monoadduct. Furthermore, while Nei and NEIL 1 also cleave a psoralen-induced four-stranded DNA substrate <b>to</b> generate two <b>unhooked</b> DNA duplexes with a nick, NEIL 3 targets both DNA strands in the ICL without generating single-strand breaks. The DNA substrate specificities of these Nei-like enzymes imply the occurrence of long uninterrupted three- and four-stranded crosslinked DNA-DNA structures that may originate in vivo from DNA replication fork bypass of an ICL. In conclusion, the Nei-like DNA glycosylases unhook psoralen-derived ICLs in various DNA structures via a genuine repair mechanism in which complex DNA lesions can be removed without generation of highly toxic double-strand breaks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using single {{molecule}} fluorescence microscopy, {{we study}} {{the dynamics of}} an electric-field-driven DNA molecule colliding with a single stationary post. The radius of the obstacle is small compared to the contour length of the molecules. Molecules that achieve hooked configurations which span the obstacle were chosen for study. Four different types of hooked configurations were found: symmetric hairpins with constant extension during unhooking, asymmetric hairpins with constant extension during unhooking, asymmetric hairpins with increasing extension during unhooking, and rare multiply looped entangled configurations. The important physics describing the unhooking dynamics for each classification differ and models are proposed <b>to</b> predict <b>unhooking</b> times. Surprisingly, we find that most collisions do not follow classic rope-on-pulley motion but instead form hairpins with increasing total extension during the unhooking process (called X collisions). Last, we show that unraveling to form a hairpin and center-of-mass motion during unhooking affect the overall center of mass hold-up time during a collision process...|$|R

60|$|Let {{us up and}} onward to {{that long}} still reach, which is now curling up fast before the breeze; there are large fish to be taken, one or two at least, even before the fly comes on. You need not change your flies; the cast which you have on--governor, and black alder--will take, if {{anything}} will. Only do not waste your time and muscle, as you are beginning to do, by hurling your flies wildly {{into the middle of}} the stream, on the chance of a fish being there. Fish are there, no doubt, but not feeding ones. They are sailing about and enjoying the warmth; but nothing more. If you want to find the hungry fish and to kill them, you must stand well back from the bank--or kneel down, if you are really in earnest about sport; and throw within a foot of the shore, above you or below (but if possible above), with a line short enough to manage easily; by which I mean short enough to enable you to lift your flies out of the water at each throw without hooking them in the docks and comfrey which grow along the brink. You must learn to raise your hand at the end of each throw, and lift the flies clean over the land-weeds: or you will lose time, and frighten all the fish, by crawling to the bank <b>to</b> <b>unhook</b> them. Believe me, one of the commonest mistakes into which young anglers fall is that of fishing in 'skipjack broad;' in plain English, in mid-stream, where few fish, and those little ones, are to be caught. Those who wish for large fish work close under the banks, and seldom take a mid-stream cast, unless they see a fish rise there.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was worth}} while to {{be a boy}} then {{in the south of}} Scotland, and to fish the waters haunted by old legends, musical with old songs, and renowned in the {{sporting}} essays of Christopher North and Stoddart. Even then, thirty long years ago, the old stagers used to tell us that [...] "the waiter was owr sair fished," [...] and they grumbled about the system of draining the land, which makes a river a roaring torrent in floods, and a bed of grey stones with a few clear pools and shallows, {{during the rest of the}} year. In times before the hills were drained, before the manufacturing towns were so populous, before pollution, netting, dynamiting, poisoning, sniggling, and the enormous increase of fair and unfair fishing, the border must have been the angler's paradise. Still, it was not bad when we were boys. We had Ettrick within a mile of us, and a finer natural trout-stream there is not in Scotland, though now the water only holds a sadly persecuted remnant. There was one long pool behind Lindean, flowing beneath a high wooded bank, where the trout literally seemed never to cease rising at the flies that dropped from the pendant boughs. Unluckily the water flowed out of the pool in a thin broad stream, directly it right angles to the pool itself. Thus the angler had, so to speak, the whole of lower Ettrick at his back when he waded: it was a long way up stream to the bank, and, as we never used landing-nets then, we naturally lost a great many trout in trying <b>to</b> <b>unhook</b> them in mid water. They only averaged as a rule from three to two to the pound, but they were strong and lively. In this pool there was a large tawny, table- shaped stone, over which the current broke. Out of the eddy behind this stone, one of my brothers one day caught three trout weighing over seven pounds, a feat which nowadays sounds quite incredible. As soon as the desirable eddy was empty, another trout, a trifle smaller than the former, seems to have occupied it. The next mile and a half, from Lindean to the junction with Tweed, was remarkable for excellent sport. In the last pool of Ettrick, the water flowed by a steep bank, and, if you cast almost on to the further side, you were perfectly safe to get fish, even when the river was very low. The flies used, three on a cast, were small and dusky, hare's ear and woodcock wing, black palmers, or, as Stoddart sings, ...|$|E
40|$|Children, LiteratureLife Lessons Ellen Handler Spitz What Charlie Heard || by Mordicai Gerstein Gertrude is Gertrude is Gertrude is Gertrude || by Jonah Winter Biographies for {{children}} tend to err by romanticizing their subjects, setting them up as paragons, and perpetuating stereotypes, {{in the spirit of}} Longfellow’s stirring and bombastic lines: “Lives of great men all remind us/ We can make our lives sublime,/ And, departing, leave behind us/ Footprints on the sands of time. ” But two recently published picture books, remarkable examples of the genre, eschew embarrassments of this sort. These books depict the American modernists Charles Ives and Gertrude Stein, not exactly conventional heroes {{for children}}, and expertly recount experiences drawn from their lives. Stein and Ives were born two years apart, in 1872 and 1874, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania and Danbury, Connecticut, respectively. They shared decades of neglect by an indifferent, uncomprehending public until, belatedly, their achievements were recognized. In 1933, with the publication of The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Stein effectively became, in France and in the United States, Gertrude Stein, while much later, in 1947, a dispirited Ives received the Pulitzer Prize for his Third Symphony (“The Camp Meeting”) after a New York performance conducted by Lou Harrison. Gerstein and Winter, inspired by modernism’s spirit of formal experimentation, offer smart and frolicsome entrées into Stein’s and Ives’s worlds. With great brio, they demonstrate what it felt like, sounded like, and looked like to have been their unusual protagonists. Neither book pretends to tell the whole story. Sparked by bold color and cunning designs, they introduce today’s children to their quirky protagonist-artists from the inside out. Gerstein and Winter welcome children into creative contact with Ives and Stein. They elicit identification, laughter, and moments of genuine pathos. On the jacket of What Charlie Heard, a young Ives, drawn true to his photographs as a boy of about ten, stands before us in suspenders and knee britches. Casually, he holds the emblems of his two great loves, music and sports: a baseball bat in his left hand and several sheets of music in his right. The first instruments he learned to play, the drum and the trumpet, rest nearby within easy reach. His eyes have a faraway look. Clearly, he is listening. All around him, we can tell exactly what he is hearing: TA TA TA TA, BONG BONG, KABLAM, POW! CRACK! CLANG! SQUEAK, CRACK! SPLASH! CLOP CLOP, WHOOOOOOOSH… Painted letters in varied fonts and sizes, colored blue, red, yellow, white, some bordered, others not, spaced idiosyncratically and traveling every which way, crowd the space. Thronging and overlapping, they form a veritable dictionary of onomatopoeia. Charlie, we grasp, is a child who dwells in a universe of pulsating sound, to which he pays pleasurable attention. Throughout the book a perpetual medley of sound fills the air. On page after page, painted sound-words march, dance, fall, spring up, cavort, and canter before our eyes. By means of Gerstein’s graphics, we are made to see what Ives hears. With minimal coaching, children listening to this picture book will soon chime in and make the noises themselves. In this way, What Charlie Heard becomes an experience that takes children inside the composer’s world and, also—by foregrounding previously ignored ambient sound—stimulates aesthetic experience. Children begin—like Ives—to imitate and improvise: to “compose. ” Focusing on Ives’s intimate relationship with his oddball bandmaster father George, a gifted cornet player and dedicated music teacher, who, as a boy himself, played for Union troops during the Civil War, Gerstein shows us just how George Ives becomes his son’s first mentor and lifelong inspiration. One day during a thunderstorm, as church bells ring, George dashes outdoors to listen. Dripping wet, he returns to the house and, sitting down at the piano, tries to replicate what he has just heard. The chords seem not quite right so he rushes back into the rain to repeat his experiment. Little Charlie watches, listens; then he too goes to the keyboard and tries to do the same. On another occasion, George Ives arranges for two bands to march through the streets of Danbury in opposite directions each playing a different tune. Charlie never forgets this: the experience finds its way years later into the second movement of his orchestral work, Three Places in New England. On a double page spread, George takes Charlie to a camp meeting at night under a tent, where ordinary people with untrained voices join together to sing hymns and create soaring impromptu music. Bursting forth on these pages are the apparently insignificant beginnings of what eventually become the hallmark of Ives’s musical composition—an enthralling mix of radical experimentation with an affectionate love for tradition. The birth of this style occurs importantly {{in the context of an}} intensely felt father-son collaboration. When, during Charles Ives’s freshman year at Yale, George Ives dies, a double page spread empties out before our eyes, and the bereft boy stands perfectly still in his pajamas next <b>to</b> an <b>unhooked</b> wall telephone, his hair unkempt from sleep, his arms hanging limp at his sides, painted in pale shadow. Slowly we read: “Charlie heard a great silence. ” In the lexicon Gerstein has so luminously developed for us throughout the preceding pages, we understand that empty space means the absence of sound. Any child reaching this page cannot help but be sobered and moved, even to the verge of tears. The loss is as real as can be achieved in a representational medium. And when we see Ives many years hence, bearded and aged, still listening, fantasizing now in his dreamy abortive way about the Universal Symphony he will never write, we and the children both know beyond words that the loss of his father remains with him and will never be assuaged. Unlike Mordicai Gerstein, Jonah Winter does not attempt to recount the story of Gertrude Stein’s life. His mood is different. He makes an ingenious choice: he invites children to a tea party at 27 rue de Fleurus, Stein’s legendary art-filled apartment in the sixth arrondissement in Paris, just off the Jardin du Luxembourg. There, alongside her guests—including Picasso, Matisse, and Hemingway—children meet Gertrude and Alice B. Toklas, who are both sitting in chairs, staring. (“Not the chairs. Chairs never stare. ”) Gently parodic prose spiced with homonym, clang association, irony, nonsense rhyme, digression, and zany rhetoric pull the child into this curious cosmos. Enchanted by Calef Brown’s paintings, with their muted hues reminiscent of Gris’s and Picasso’s cubism, the child even meets Basket, Gertrude’s snooty clipped poodle. Romping from page to page, the text forces the eyes as well as the mind to bounce like rubber balls. Reading this book aloud to a four-and-a-half year old and to several other children, I made the obvious discovery that children are high modernists. They revel in repetition. They delight in Winter’s quasi-parental autocratic admonitions: “But but but but wait a minute… heavens no…no no no no no… More talk. Laugh. Okay. Enough. ” At the end of the party, a great disconnected arm (Alice’s, no doubt) reaches out with a long pink index finger and extends, pointing, across the entire page: “Okay time for you to leave… Leave. Go. Out, out, out. ” You must leave because Miss Gertrude writes at night while Alice sleeps. Her hand-written words tumble magically across the page into Alice’s typewriter when, the next morning, while Gertrude is sleeping, Alice diligently transcribes them. Earlier, Picasso enters the party, his iconic straight hair falling over his left eye. He looks angry, says the text: “He just invented Modern art which is not the same as being angry but then again maybe it is. Maybe it is and maybe it isn’t. Then again maybe it is. It’s so hard to invent Modern art. ” The four-year-old boy I know laughs uproariously at these lines—and his father now asks him routinely whether he is really angry or whether he has just invented Modern art! Ample Gertrude and slender Alice relate to one another in a complementary way; comfortable and unexceptional, their lesbianism simply a fact, unremarkable and unaccented. What matters supremely in both of these outstanding children’s books is that they enable children to grow aesthetically. And both books teach that significant human relationships have been indispensable to certain great artists and deeply implicated in their path-breaking works of art.

He, indeed, rose with an attitude so menacing that I was glad to lay hands on an old barrel-hoop; and I think the weapon must have been familiar, for the champion instantly retreated, and as I wandered round the court and through the building, I could see him, {{with a couple of}} companions, humbly dodging me about the corners. The prisoners' dormitory was a spacious, airy room, devoid of any furniture; its whitewashed walls covered with inscriptions in Marquesan and rude drawings: one of the pier, not badly done; one of a murder; several of French soldiers in uniform. There was one legend in French: [...] "Je n'est" [...] (sic) [...] "pas le sou." [...] From this noontide quietude it must not be supposed the prison was untenanted; the calaboose at Tai-o-hae does a good business. But some of its occupants were gardening at the Residency, and the rest were probably at work upon the streets, as free as our scavengers at home, although not so industrious. On the approach of evening they would be called in like children from play; and the harbour-master (who is also the gaoler) would go through the form of locking them up until six the next morning. Should a prisoner have any call in town, whether of pleasure or affairs, he has but <b>to</b> <b>unhook</b> the window-shutter; and if he is back again, and the shutter decently replaced, by the hour of call on the morrow, he may have met the harbour-master in the avenue, {{and there will be no}} complaint, far less any punishment.

[...] Meanwhile no other convict was to be seen--"Eh bien," [...] said the Resident, [...] "où sont vos prisonniers?" [...] "Monsieur le Résident," [...] replied the gaoler, saluting with soldierly formality, [...] "comme c'est jour de fête, je les ai laissé aller à la chasse." [...] They were all upon the mountains hunting goats! Presently we came to the quarters of the women, likewise deserted--"Où sont vos bonnes femmes?"

Delaruelle, who was much in love with the whimsicalities of his small realm, to elicit something comical; but not even he expected anything so perfect as the last. To complete the picture of convict life in Tai-o-hae, it remains to be added that these criminals draw a salary as regularly as the President of the Republic. Ten sous a day is their hire. Thus they have money, food, shelter, clothing, and, I was about to write, their liberty. The French are certainly a good-natured people, and make easy masters.
