40|$|<b>Teleprotection</b> {{for power}} systems is safety-critical and has {{demanding}} requirements for bandwidth, low latency, and low jitter. Traditionally, time-division multiplexing (TDM) using SONET/SDH circuits {{has been used}} to provide this quality of service. Modern packet-based networks offer several advantages, such as improved flexibility and greater bandwidth efficiency. With IP/MPLS, packet-based networks can cater for <b>teleprotection</b> functionality. This report demonstrates the potential for commercially-available IP/MPLS hardware to provide <b>teleprotection</b> functionality over two DSL technologies, VDSL and SHDSL. A real-time hardware in the loop environment has been developed to test these schemes under a variety of scenarios, which are indicative of real-world conditions. Commercially-available protection relays were used to implement C 37. 94 -based communications, and the stability of the protection functions were monitored closely during the testing. The results highlight the maximum DSL line distance and the remaining bandwidth (after provisioning for the <b>teleprotection)</b> which can be achieved, whilst observing a 6 ms propagation delay restriction. VDSL is only suitable for links up to approximately 1. 4 km, although it can deliver relatively high bandwidth of 4 - 19 Mbps, depending on the line distance. SHDSL can support up to 4 - 5 km per span. Distances of approximately 4. 3 km offer a good compromise of distance, delay, and remaining bandwidth. Using two serially-connected SHDSL spans is beneficial: it can support either longer distances, or provide greater spare bandwidth. The number of C 37. 94 slots used for <b>teleprotection</b> should be greater than 4, where possible, to help reduce the propagation delay. Each DSL modem type “favours” particular MPLS payload sizes, and these values provide the best compromises in connection distance, delay, and remaining bandwidth – as well as ensuring that the protection scheme remains stable...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{micro-grid}} is an aggregation {{of electrical}} and heat loads and small capacity micro-sources operating {{as a single}} controllable unit at the low or medium voltage level. Nowadays, digital telecommunications {{have been used in}} many industrial applications which micro-grid protection has also been benefited. Occurred challenges in distribution network caused by micro-grids presence, telecommunication and distribution engineers failure in recognizing the protection schema requirements and telecommunication networks restrictions always have made problems in implementation and utilization of the protection schema. In this paper, in addition to introducing types of telecommunication technology and protection system, problems existed in applying the digital telecommunication network is also evaluated for protection purpose in micro-grids and some points which a schema should consider for <b>teleprotection</b> system to make improvement and dependability is also explained...|$|E
40|$|Disturbance {{recordings}} {{are used}} together with {{sequence of events}} (SOE) data to document and understand a power system fault; to manually verify the behaviour of digital protection relay; and nowadays, to perform automatic fault analysis (AFA) {{for the sake of}} fast and accurate fault location and to assist fault analysis engineers in their task. This paper focuses on two additional uses of the disturbance recordings. The general purpose is to gain insight into the condition of the monitorable assets using information from recorded signals. The authors suggest that each significant power system event provides an opportunity to verify that key processes behave within their design limits. The first field of application is circuit breaker monitoring. If sampled currents are recorded, it is shown that a system can monitor virtually all switching events, provide some alerts in near real-time if some critical conditions are found, and produce history data that are usable for long-term statistics in asset management systems. The second area of interest is automatic monitoring of protection schemes. The paper presents a literature survey about this topic, then it describes a methodology to verify major protection scheme automatically, on the occasion of every recorded short-circuit fault occurring in the grid, provided that enough event-related data are collected. The verifications consider essential design targets like maximum fault clearance time, phase-segregated tripping, maximum allowable time delay of <b>teleprotection</b> signals, pick-up for back-up protection of distant lines, etc. This process may issue some alerts or warnings for immediate consideration by fault analysts, drawing their attention on potential weaknesses of the protection system that may have severe consequences on security. But the main use of the presented technology is to generate statistical inputs for off-line verification of the protection behaviour on a large scale, since utilities routinely manage thousands of protection relays. Monitoring of their field performance complements routine protection testing very nicely. As an example, a relay that picked up recently and correctly hardly requires testing, except a verification of the tripping circuit. On the other hand, a distance relay that failed to pick up in protection zone 3 or 4, to provide back-up protection of a remote line, may be considered for an early inspection even if its self-check functions indicate that the device is operating. The paper discusses methodologies for circuit breaker and protection monitoring for transmission systems and underlines the main operational uses of these monitoring tools by transmission system operators. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The radio noise (RN) performance of an AC high voltage transmission line is a determining factor when accessing the reliability of the design. The conducted RN level across the terminals of a PLC receiver, used in the <b>teleprotection</b> system of the line, is of particular concern. In this dissertation, existing empirical and semi-analytical RN prediction methods are evaluated by comparing the conducted RN levels of four South African lines to the predicted levels. Existing RN measurement protocols are consolidated and a new RN measurement protocol is proposed for the comparison. A prediction methodology, based on the EdF, EPRI and IREQ semi-analytical methods, is formulated. The semi-analytical methods are not able to accurately predict the variation of the conducted RN with frequency in the PLC band, nor are they able to predict the RN performance of short lines. A wideband excitation function, which considers the statistical characteristics of the measured RN pulse train, is therefore proposed in this dissertation. Having investigated the extraction of this excitation function from ESKOM’s Megawatt Park corona cage, it is concluded that a small corona cage is required. The design of a small cage is presented and the extraction of the excitation function is described. Attention is given to assessing the effect of changes in space charge distributions. The effect of space charge collision with an insulated cage on the extracted pulse parameters is linear, provided space charge diffusion is negligible. The onset streamer, positive streamer and negative streamer corona modes were identified as the only modes with measurable RN in the frequency regime 150 kHz to 30 MHz. Formulas are derived for the prediction of the inception gradients for these modes. The RN performance of an ACSR Hare conductor is extracted from the small cage. The RN performance of the Acacia-Koeberg line is also approximated in the PLC band. The dissertation concludes that the proposed wideband excitation function method is capable of accurately predicting the variation of RN levels with frequency. It {{can also be used to}} predict the RN performance of short line sections, as well as the relationship between RMS, QP and average RN levels from a transmission line. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die korona-werkverrigting van ‘n WS hoogspanningstransmissielyn het belangrike gevolge vir die betroubaarheid van die ontwerp van die lyn. Die geleide radioruis (RR) vlak op die kraglyndragolf kommunikasie sisteem, wat vir tele-beveiliging gebruik word, is veral van belang. In hierdie werkstuk word bestaande metodes gebruik om die korona-werkverrigting te bepaal en dan met gemete waardes van vier Suid Afrikaanse lyne te vergelyk. Bestaande RR meetmetodes word saamgevat en ‘n nuwe metingsprotokol word voorgestel om resultate te vergelyk. Na aanleiding van hierdie vergelykings word ‘n tegniek ontwikkel om die RR van ‘n lyn te voorspel. Hierdie tegniek gebruik die EdF, EPRI en IREQ metodes. Die voorgestelde tegniek kan nie die verandering van die RR met frekwensie bepaal nie. Dit kan ook nie die RR van kort lyne bepaal nie. ‘n Wyeband RR bron word dus voorgestel. Nadat ESKOM se Megawatt Park korona-kou ondersoek is, is die gevolgtrekking gemaak dat ‘n klein koronakou die nodige wyeband RR bron sal voorsien. Ruimtelading bots met die klein korona-kou. Die effek van hierdie botsings op die pulsparameters is lineer indien ladingsdiffusie nie plaasvind nie. Die aanvangs, positiewe en negatiewe kanaalontladings (“streamers”) is identifiseer as die enigste koronamodusse wat RR veroorsaak tussen 150 kHz en 30 MHz. Die spanning waarby hierdie modusse voorkom, is bepaal. Die korona-werkverrigting van ‘n “ACSR Hare” geleier is bepaal. Die korona-werkverrigting van die Acacia-Koeberg transmissie lyn is ook gekwantifiseer by die kraglyn-dragolf kommunikasie frekwensies. Die wyebandbron metode kan die verandering in RR met frekwensie goed voorspel. Die nuwe metode kan ook gebruik word om die RR van kort lyne te bepaal, asook die verband tussen RMS, QP en gemiddelde RR vlakke...|$|E
