[...] "You {{see one of}} the {{greatest}} nations in the world going through its hour of agony, and you think nothing but how you yourselves will be affected! Every thinking person in Russia regrets that this thing should have come to pass at such a time. Yet it is best for you English to look the truth in the face. It wasn't the Russian people who were pledged to you, with whom you were bound in alliance. It was that accursed trick all European politicians have of making secret treaties and secret understandings, building up buffer States, trying to whittle away a piece of the map for yourselves, trying all the time to be dishonest under the shadow of what is called diplomacy. That is what brought the war about. It was never the will of the people. It was the Hohenzollerns and the Romanoffs, the firebrands of the French Cabinet, and your own clumsy, thick-headed efforts to get the best of everybody and yet keep your Nonconformist conscience. The people did not make this war, but it is <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to end it." ...|$|E
60|$|On we flew, {{drawn by}} the mighty current, till at last I noticed that {{the sound of the}} water was not half so {{deafening}} as it had been, and concluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes to disperse in. I could now hear Alphonse's howls much more distinctly; they were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the Supreme Power and the name of his beloved Annette {{that it is possible to}} conceive; and, in short, though their evident earnestness saved them from profanity, were, to say the least, very remarkable. Taking up a paddle I managed to drive it into his ribs, whereon he, thinking that the end had come, howled louder than ever. Then I slowly and cautiously raised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards, but could touch no roof. Next I took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as I could, but with the same result. I also thrust it out laterally to the right and left, but could touch nothing except water. Then I bethought me that there was in the boat, amongst our other remaining possessions, a bull's-eye lantern and a tin of oil. I groped about and found it, and having a match on me carefully lit it, and as soon as the flame had got a hold of the wick I turned it on down the boat. As it happened, the first thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of Alphonse, who, thinking that it was all over at last, and that he was witnessing a preliminary celestial phenomenon, gave a terrific yell and was with difficulty reassured with the paddle. As for the other three, Good was lying on the flat of his back, his eyeglass still fixed in his eye, and gazing blankly into the upper darkness. Sir Henry had his head resting on the thwarts of the canoe, and with his hand was trying to test the speed of the water. But when the beam of light fell upon old Umslopogaas I could really have laughed. I think I have said that we had put a roast quarter of water-buck into the canoe. Well, it so happened that when we all prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into the water by the rock roof, Umslopogaas's head had come down uncommonly near this roast buck, and so soon as he had recovered a little from the first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry. Thereupon he coolly cut off a chop with Inkosi-kaas, and was now employed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction. As he afterwards explained, he thought that he was going 'on a long journey', and preferred to start on a full stomach. It reminded me of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be hanged, and who are generally reported in the English daily papers to have made 'an excellent breakfast'.|$|E

50|$|Before {{a project}} {{schedule}} can be created, the schedule maker {{should have a}} work breakdown structure (WBS), an effort estimate for each task, and a resource list with availability for each resource. If these components for the schedule are not available, they can be created with a consensus-driven estimation method like Wideband Delphi.

Lunch boxes provide a way to take heavier lunches in a sturdier box or bag. It is also environmentally friendly.|$|E

Literature review, observations and interviews carried out in Alti Nokta The Blind Association, Göreneller Primary Education School and internet cafe are utilised in this descriptive research. The results are as follows: Visually handicapped students are trained as computer literate with “Information and Communication Technologies” elective course in primary schools and visually handicapped adults are trained in related associations, however, it is seen that the ratio of benefitting from these trainings are low. Moreover, the numbers of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be employed as instructors are low. The cost of the hardware and software regarding visually handicapped individuals is more expensive; therefore, the ratio of having computer among visually handicapped individuals is low...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{software}} programs developed by many software developers in these days. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to interact with}} them need some time to learn {{about how to do}} their tasks using those software programs. Some of these software programs need more than expected time to learn about using them because of poor design of the User Interfaces. User Interfaces are the main windows which are used by the people to interact with the software programs, because of that they must be designed in better way which attracts the attention of the user. Therefore in Human Computer Interaction principles, there some principles for User Interfaces design effective User Interfaces to attract attention of the user to the program. When designing software programs it is necessary to find hotspots on the User Interfaces where the user gives more attention than others. This paper proposes a method of performance evaluation of the User Interfaces of the software programs by testing the software program with actual users of the software program and tracking gaze point of users with the time. By using that information the software developers can find the hotspots of the User Interfaces and include the most important things to the user in those areas. The software developers will be able to develop the User Interfaces of their programs attractive, efficient & effective manner which get more attention of the users of that software program...|$|E
