5|$|In Ada's story, it is {{revealed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Ada</b> Wong that interacted with Chris and Piers {{was actually a}} doppelgänger created by Simmons, a scientist named Carla Radames, and that the real Ada Wong was aiding Leon and Sherry while destroying the Neo-Umbrella lab in Langshiang. It's soon revealed that Carla {{is the cause of}} the game's events, both wanting to get revenge on Simmons for the transformation and take over the world with her bioweapons. Although presumed dead after being shot by one of Simmons' soldiers, Carla attempts a final attack against the real Ada, after having injected herself with a powerful dose of the C-virus, but is killed. After aiding Leon and Helena in their battle with Simmons, Ada reaches the lab where her clone was developed and destroys everything. She then receives a call from someone, accepting a new assignment. With the world saved, the heroes continue with their lives: Leon and Helena are cleared for duty; Chris remains with the BSAA in command of a new squad, overcoming his guilt; and Sherry continues her duty as a DSO agent, while Jake starts a new life fighting zombies in an underdeveloped country with his real identity covered up by the BSAA, with Jake's blood sample able to be used for a C-virus cure.|$|E

The Friday preceding 10 days to the Akwasidae is called the Fofie (meaning a ritual Friday). As the festival is always held on Sundays (Twi in Kwasidae), its recurrence could be after 40 or 42 days {{in accordance with the}} official Calendar of Ashanti.

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{marriage}}s in Comoros, the Mna dabo (little marriage) and <b>the</b> <b>ada</b> (grand marriage). The little marriage is a simple legal marriage. It is small, intimate, and inexpensive. The bride price is nominal. The little marriage, however, is just a placeholder until the couple can afford <b>the</b> <b>ada,</b> or grand marriage. The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bride price. The groom must pay most of the expenses for this event, and the bride’s family typically pays only a third of that of the groom’s. The grand wedding can cost up to £55,000. Many men cannot afford this until their late 40's, if ever.|$|E

Generally, this coincides with the harvest season of yam, and hence the ritual was also called the Yam custom by Europeans. It is celebrated at this season to thank the gods and the ancestors for a good harvest. The season is equally used to outdoor the new yam.|$|R
