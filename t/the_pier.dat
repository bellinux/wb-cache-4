5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} side of <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> causing four shops {{and part of}} the deck to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> Damage to <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was estimated to be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pier</b> was an {{immediate}} success and quickly {{became one of the}} most popular landmarks in Brighton. By 1911, the reading rooms had been converted into a theatre. Both Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin performed at <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> to hone their comic skills early in their career, before migrating to the US and finding major commercial success in Hollywood. During World War I, the sea surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was extensively mined to prevent enemy attacks. In the 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was widened, and a distinctive clock tower was added.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pier</b> {{was built}} and {{owned by the}} Blackpool Pier Company, created with three {{thousand}} £5-shares in 1861 (worth approximately £2,990 in 2012). The same firm operated <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> in 1953, and the company was incorporated in 1965. The Resorts Division of First Leisure, including <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> was sold to Leisure Parks for £74 million in 1998. In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was sold to the Six Piers group, which owns Blackpool's other two piers, and hoped {{to use it as}} a more tranquil alternative to them. The new owners opened the Victorian-themed tea room, and built an eight-seat shuttle running the length of <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Scheduled tourist and {{commuter}} services use <b>the</b> following <b>piers,</b> {{although no}} single service serves all <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> listed. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> {{are listed in}} order going downstream: ...|$|R
50|$|Construction on {{the bridge}} began in August, 1902 with the sinking of <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> Workers who worked inside <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were called sandhogs. They worked one hour at a time twice a day inside <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> One worker {{died as a result}} of the bends.|$|R
25|$|In drilled <b>pier</b> foundations, <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> can be {{connected}} with grade beams on which the structure sits, sometimes with heavy column loads bearing directly on <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> In some residential construction, <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> are extended above the ground level and wood beams bearing on <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> are used to support the structure. This type of foundation results in a crawl space underneath the building in which wiring and duct work can be laid during construction or re-modelling.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pier</b> {{was closed}} for the winter during 1895–96 as it unsafe; as a result, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was widened as {{electric}} lighting was added.|$|E
5|$|An Arcade Pavilion {{was added}} in 1903 at the {{entrance}} to <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> and contained a wide range of amusements to suit all tastes. Further alterations were made to <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> in 1932-33 when the open air stand was replaced with a stage and sun lounge.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, the West Pier Trust {{remained}} {{adamant that}} they would soon begin full restoration work. Retired boxer Chris Eubank criticised the delays in restoring <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> saying he could raise the money himself in six months. In December 2004, the Trust confirmed the restoration would not be going ahead after their plans were rejected by the Heritage Lottery Fund. <b>The</b> <b>pier</b> was partially demolished in February 2010, partly {{to make way for}} the planned i360 observation tower. In February 2014, due to stormy weather, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> split in half and a large part of the centre fell into the sea. Waves swept away the eastern side of the damaged metal skeleton, which remained after the 2003 fire. A selection of artefacts rescued from <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> is exhibited in the Brighton Fishing Museum. A further section of <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> collapsed in 2016.|$|E
50|$|By 1880, the COE had {{completed}} {{most of the}} construction work. During the 1880s, both of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were extended to give greater protection to the harbor and reduce the shoaling of sand into the channel. By 1890, <b>the</b> north <b>pier</b> was about 1,120 feet long, and <b>the</b> south <b>pier</b> approximately 1,300 feet. Despite the improvements to the harbor, serious problems with sand bars developing remained, and <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were extended again, <b>the</b> north <b>pier</b> by 600 feet and <b>the</b> south <b>pier</b> by 550 feet.|$|R
50|$|Despite using full engine-power the Maassluis wasn't {{able to move}} {{free from}} <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> and around 23:30 the ship comes in contact with <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> and breaks up.|$|R
50|$|As the {{caissons}} {{were being}} sunk into <b>the</b> riverbed, <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were being built {{on top of}} them, adding weight and driving the caisson deeper into the river bottom. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> were masonry blocks of granite backed with concrete. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> of <b>the</b> Harahan were located directly upstream of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> of <b>the</b> Frisco Bridge to keep the navigation channels open to river traffic. Pier IV was moved 17 feet toward the river relative to the Frisco Pier IV. This enabled the engineers to design two suspended spans and three cantilevered arms identically.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{was closed}} as a {{security}} precaution. A section of decking was removed {{in order to prevent}} access from an enemy landing. <b>The</b> <b>pier</b> regained its popularity after the war, and continued to run regular summer shows, including Tommy Trinder, Doris and Elsie Waters and Dick Emery.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th and early 20th centuries <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was popular both with locals and {{tourists}} to the town. As a boarding point for steamers plying their trade in the Bristol Channel, it underwent various extensions and modifications over the years. During the Second World War <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck by the Admiralty as part of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. <b>The</b> <b>pier</b> reopened after the war, but the number of visitors and steamer passengers declined. The final excursion visited <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> in 1979.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piers</b> house {{associations}} of boatmen who {{are dedicated to}} the transport of tourists to the various beaches of Morrocoy. Las luisas, Morrocoy and Aguasalobre are <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> in <b>the</b> area.|$|R
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>pier's</b> {{buildings}} have been unoccupied since {{the decline of}} shipbuilding in the area. However, some of <b>the</b> <b>pier's</b> historic buildings are still used, one is used for artist studios.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piers</b> of <b>the</b> four apses {{that project}} from each outer wall are also strong, to {{withstand}} the outward thrust of the half-domes upon them. Many niches articulate the wall-spaces of <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1962 the {{holdings}} of the St Anne's Land & Building Company (including <b>the</b> <b>pier)</b> were {{bought by the}} Amalgamated Investment Company, based in London. Some alterations to <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{were made by the}} new owners, including the addition of an aviary and a reptile house. The Floral Hall was refurbished and turned into a Tyrolean-style beer garden.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, £1 {{million of}} damage was caused to <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> by {{drifting}} equipment during engineering work in Sand Bay, {{to the north}} of <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> The damage was quickly repaired, despite fears that Birnbeck might become like nearby Clevedon Pier, which at the time was severed by a collapsed span. <b>The</b> <b>pier</b> was again badly damaged by storms in 1990 and was closed for safety reasons in 1994. Daily trips during the summer months to and from Cardiff, Clevedon, and Penarth were suspended indefinitely. Due to the decline, English Heritage has placed it on the Heritage at Risk register. In 1999, the lifeboat station installed a walkway across <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> to allow them safe access to the island, at a cost of £20,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{was sold}} to Manchester company Urban Splash. The new owners {{launched}} a competition in August 2007, inviting people to submit ideas for the regeneration of <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> and island. At the time, the repair work required was estimated at £4 million.|$|E
40|$|In the performance-based seismic bridge design, piers are {{expected}} to undergo large inelastic deformations during severe earthquakes, which in turn can result in large residual drift and concrete crack in <b>the</b> bridge <b>piers.</b> In this paper, longitudinal unbonded prestressing strands are used to minimize residual drift and residual concrete crack width in reinforced concrete (RC) bridge piers. Seven pier specimens were designed and tested quasi-statically and the numerical simulations were carried out. The effectiveness of using vertical unbonded prestressing strands to mitigate the residual drift and concrete crack width of RC bridge piers are examined and discussed in detail. It is found that the residual drift and residual concrete crack width of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> can be reduced significantly by using the prestressing strands. Moreover, the strands can increase the lateral strength of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> while have little influence on the ductility capacity of <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> <b>The</b> hysteretic curves, residual drifts and strand stress of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> predicted by <b>the</b> numerical model agree well with the testing data {{and can be used}} to assess the cyclic behavior of <b>the</b> <b>piers...</b>|$|R

2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 19th century the island had ten {{pleasure}} piers including two at Ryde and a [...] "chain pier" [...] at Seaview. The Victoria Pier in Cowes succeeded the earlier Royal Pier but was itself removed in 1960. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> at Ryde, Seaview, Sandown, Shanklin and Ventnor originally served a coastal steamer service that operated from Southsea on <b>the</b> mainland. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> at Seaview, Shanklin, Ventnor and Alum Bay were all destroyed by various storms during the 20th century; only <b>the</b> railway <b>pier</b> at Ryde and <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> at Sandown, Totland Bay (currently closed to the public) and Yarmouth survive.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, the Noble Organisation put <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> for sale, with an {{expected}} price of £30 million. It was rumoured {{that the council}} wanted to buy <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> but this was quickly ruled out. It {{was taken off the}} market the following year, due to lack of interest in suitable buyers. In 2016, it was sold to the Eclectic Bar Group, headed by former PizzaExpress owner Luke Johnson, who renamed <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> back to Brighton Palace Pier in July.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{was sold}} to a Blackpool family firm, Sedgwick's, the owners of {{amusement}} arcades and the big wheel on Blackpool's Central Pier. Peter Sedgwick explained that he proposed to his wife on North Pier forty years ago, and promised to buy it for her one day. He said {{that he wants to}} restore the Victorian heritage of <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> and re-instate the pier's tram. An admission charge of fifty pence to access the board-walk section of <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was abolished by the Sedgwicks.|$|E
5|$|In December 2002, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{partially}} collapsed {{during a}} storm, when a walkway connecting {{the concert hall}} and pavilion fell into the sea. The following month, the concert hall {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> fell over, leaving the entire structure close to total collapse.|$|E
50|$|Pre-stressed {{concrete}} beams {{supported by}} piers made of concrete blocks span the 50 foot (15 m) width {{of each of}} the two main sections of the building, leaving them free of internal support columns. In line with his belief that structure should be made visible, Kahn distinguished <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> from <b>the</b> non-weight-bearing walls within which they are embedded by using concrete blocks the size of bricks for <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> and larger concrete blocks for the walls. The beams are clearly visible in the interior of the building as are the ends of the beams on top of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> on <b>the</b> exterior. <b>The</b> <b>piers,</b> which are on the long sides of the building, project from the external walls to create a light-and-shadow effect. Kahn created additional visual interest by placing the twelve sets of piers in a pattern that is not quite equally spaced; the walls between <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> alternate between being slightly wider than expected and slightly narrower than expected.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>piers</b> were {{designed}} to accommodate public restrooms. The deck widens at <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> to provide room for the stairways - {{one on each side}} of the deck - that once descended to the restrooms. Repeated vandalism led to the closure of the restrooms in 1937, and the stairway entrances were covered over with concrete. Windows for [...] "observation balconies" [...] that were originally included in <b>the</b> <b>piers,</b> at <b>the</b> tops on both sides, were also sealed in concrete after closure.|$|R
50|$|White Lake Harbor is an {{man-made}} channel {{running through}} {{strip of land}} which separates White Lake from Lake Michigan. The associated navigation structures include three elements: <b>the</b> south <b>pier,</b> <b>the</b> north <b>pier,</b> and <b>the</b> revetments. The north and south piers are parallel to each other, and are 200 feet apart, <b>The</b> north <b>pier</b> is 1717 feet long and <b>the</b> south <b>pier</b> is 1953 feet long. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> are constructed {{from a series of}} piles near the shore, and additional cribs at the end. <b>The</b> entire <b>pier</b> has a concrete superstructure. The revetments were originally of timber pile. A double row of sheet piling was added later, and concrete replaced the timber superstructure.|$|R
5|$|Local Action, a loose {{alliance}} of protesters on site, described <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> as {{a cornerstone of}} Hong Kong identity. By linking <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> with earlier social movements in late 1960s and early 1970s, it argued that the place {{was a symbol of}} Hong Kong civic activism and therefore should not be demolished.|$|E
5|$|No.14 and No.27 buses run {{directly}} from Brighton railway station to <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1994, a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA near <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was defused by a {{controlled}} explosion. A similar bomb {{by the same}} perpetrators had exploded in Bognor Regis on the same day. The bombing was intended to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of The Troubles. <b>The</b> <b>pier</b> was closed for several days owing to police investigation.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of five truss spans supported on two concrete abutments and four common concrete <b>piers.</b> <b>The</b> concrete <b>piers</b> are <b>the</b> {{width of the}} bridge, and have buttress-like quoining at each end, with rendered detailing. <b>The</b> two northeastern <b>piers</b> are located on the northern embankment, with <b>the</b> remaining two <b>piers</b> located within <b>the</b> river. The two concrete embankments have rendered details similar to <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> city built <b>piers</b> in 1920, {{but they}} were never fully exploited. From 1937 to 1942 several of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were used as the first Foreign Trade Zone in the United States. From 1942 to 1945, they became the Staten Island Terminal {{facility}} of the Army's New York Port of Embarkation. After World War II, <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> once again became a foreign trade zone, but their use declined and most of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were demolished by the 1970s. The last, used for fishing, was removed when the U.S. Navy proposed to build a base in Stapleton in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piers</b> built between 1 and 3 ft {{into the}} bedrock, which was {{achieved}} by using cofferdams, {{and the depth of}} the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> is between 6 ft and 11 ft below the summer level of <b>the</b> river. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> are 18 ft high from the summer level of the river {{to the base of the}} arches, and 29 ft long and 10 ft deep, with a straight profile. The masonry used is ashlar, and the stone is a reddish sandstone quarried nearby.|$|R
