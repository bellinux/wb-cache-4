25|$|According <b>to</b> <b>NPR</b> in 2005, about 3% {{of illegal}} {{immigrants}} were working in agriculture. The H-2A visa allows U.S. employers to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs.

Overall losses caused by the act were $1 billion; it was estimated that the figure would become over $20 billion if all the estimated 325,000 undocumented workers left Georgia.
