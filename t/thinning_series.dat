5000|$|The {{grassland}} sparrow is {{a robust}} species {{with a large}} head and a short tail, with a total length of about 13 cm. The wings are short and the legs fairly long. The upper parts are brownish-grey streaked with black. The breast and flanks are greyish-buff or pinkish-buff and the underparts are dull white. There is a narrow white eye-ring, and a spot of yellow on the lores and another on the bend of the wing.

40|$|The Upper Permian in the Netherlands, as {{known from}} {{borehole}} data, is deposited in a mainly evaporitic facies {{north of the}} Brabant and Rhenish Massifs. In the extreme south (Belgian Campine, de Peel) a near-shore facies of reef dolomites and elastics occurs. In the western and central Netherlands the Upper Permian is represented by a thin sequence of anhydrite and dolomite with some elastics (anhydrite facies). The rock salt facies, developed in the northeastern part of the country, is subdivided into 4 evaporation cycles. Each cycle, when complete, consists {{of a series of}} claystone, dolomite, anhydrite, rock salt, bitter salts, laid down under conditions of increasing basin salinity followed by a <b>thin</b> <b>series</b> of rocksalt and anhydrite, deposited under decreasing salinity. The depositional rhythm of the deposits in the rock salt facies is caused by periodic northward shifts of the area of greatest subsidence. Owing to tectonic movements, initiating these shifts, changes occurred in the physiographic conditions relating to entrance channel and basin causing the basin salinity to decrease. Only during periods of relatively low salinity did euxinic conditions exist which gave rise to bituminous deposits. From the distribution of dolomites and bituminous deposits the presence of an east-west striking swell, the Cocvorden Swell, has been inferred, showing that this was a higher and more slowly subsiding tract in the Upper Permian basin. The transition of marine Upper Permian to continental Bunter cannot be regarded as a time boundary; nor are time and rock units within the Upper Permian basin necessarily identical...|$|R
