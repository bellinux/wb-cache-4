I was very drained." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's very tiring having other people <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Thompson's {{father died}} as a result of circulatory {{problems}} at the age of 52. The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I regret his not being around". She added, [...] "At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I've done ... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} find out what the chances are of a patient with a {{positive}} or negative test result having or not having the disease, the likelihood ratios (LRs) need to be calculated. The LR incorporates both the sensitivity and specificity of the test and provides an estimate of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> a positive or negative test result changes the chances of having or not having the disease. So a positive LR <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more likely patients are to have the disease when the test is positive. The negative LR <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> less likely patients are to have the disease when the test is negative.|$|R

500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time to mess with us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Weber {{complained of}} both the control exerted by {{consolidated}} studios, {{as well as the}} ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: [...] "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you can pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne. But when they tell you that they also will cut your picture, that is too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baker is cynical of {{religion}} and describes himself as irreligious, or occasionally as Buddhist, but not anti-religious. He states: [...] "People are quite happy believing the wrong things. I wasn't unhappy believing all that shit. Now I'm not unhappy thinking about it because I can laugh at it." [...] Politically, Baker has expressed disdain for both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, saying in 1998: [...] "When the Conservatives were in I cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I hated them. But I realise how shallow I am because I now hate the Labour Party as much." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} at GamesCon 2011, Senior Manager of Marketing Communications Arne Meyer spoke of the unprecedented size of Uncharted 3 stating [...] "Uncharted 2 barely made it to 25GB, while Naughty Dog is going over 50GB this time, for Uncharted 3. But in the end we'll be under 50. We'll be one disc." [...] Meyer also spoke {{of what it is}} like to work with the PlayStation platform stating [...] "I think it really helps. It's not even about sales. It's about what we can push on the platform and how far we can take it. I'm sure you'll hear this from every other Sony developer but you know, I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we've been able to optimise Cell and you know, the amount of content we can put on Blu-ray." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1891 Corbett {{retired from}} the business, bestowing his share on his eldest son Henry Jagger Corbett. [...] His {{longtime}} right hand and partner, who was by then managing the business, wrote: [...] "Dear Sir, … In your letter, you make an allusion to the long time (40 years) you {{have been engaged in}} this business and it brings strongly to my mind that these forty years I have been nearly thirty four years with you. This period of over a third of a century covers my entire business life. I need not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I regret your withdrawal from the firm,... I owe much to your kindness, careful training and good example, and at this moment it is some comfort to me to reflect that I have been faithful to your interests and useful to you for many years. That it may please God to restore you to health and grant you many happy years of life is my hope and prayer. Yours very truly, [...] Edward Failing" ...|$|E
2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E

2500|$|Another Spanish businessman, who {{supervised}} ABM's {{operations in}} Equatorial Guinea from 1995 to 1997, said Teodorín [...] "would call {{us to come}} to his office, which meant wearing a suit and tie. He would keep you waiting for five hours and then appear wearing shorts. He would then <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he wanted you to pay him, and that you had a week to do so, saying: 'If you don't pay, we will confiscate the machinery and give your concession to the Chinese.' We had to flee the country. He was demanding millions. The only ones who stayed were those who paid him." [...] Yet another Spanish firm, which was forced to work with a local company on whose board of directors Teodorin sat, [...] "had to pay commissions at every stage of the way" [...] and was confronted [...] "with permits and other obstacles"; after the firm had filled a warehouse with timber, one member of the firm was arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of rape, apparently a standard way of treating foreign businesspeople. [...] "He caught malaria and had a fever....In return for being allowed to leave, he had to agree to leave all his money and the timber warehouse behind." ...|$|E
