5|$|Animals such as frogs are {{patterned}} so {{that when}} they are at rest with legs <b>tucked</b> <b>in,</b> their outline is powerfully disrupted with markings that seem to flow across body and leg boundaries. Eyes too are often hidden in stripes.|$|E
5|$|Following such performances, the Jackson {{brothers}} {{would be}} <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> bed by their oblivious mother and {{reminded of the}} virtues of being a good Jehovah's Witness. Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli reflected on Jackson's early life and noted that {{at such a young}} age, the singer may not have been psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events. The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E
5|$|The Garter is worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions {{around the}} left calf by knights {{and around the}} left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled and tucked end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.|$|E

5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> the ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E

25|$|The {{boots were}} made from felt and leather and though heavy would be {{comfortable}} and wide enough to accommodate the trousers <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> before lacing tightly. They were heelless, though the soles were thick and lined with fur. Worn with felt socks, the feet were unlikely to get cold.|$|E
25|$|Running {{with the}} hands pumping, {{tucked into the}} side.

25|$|In casual usage, these {{conventions}} {{are often}} not followed, with many choosing to wear shirts not <b>tucked</b> <b>in,</b> or leaving the top button undone with a tie. This is commonly done by children and young men, particularly as part of school uniform, where it is not allowed. Even more casually, some now choose not to iron their shirts, or use nontraditional 'non-iron' fabrics.|$|E
25|$|The uniform gives a Cub Scout {{visibility}} {{and creates a}} level of identity within both the unit and the community. The neckerchief, the neckerchief slide and the belt buckle uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers. In all cases, shirts are <b>tucked</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} Kandyan (osaria) style {{consists of}} a full blouse which covers the midriff completely and is partially <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the sari is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the pleated rosette used in the Dravidian style noted earlier in the article.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after the White House, Kennedy's style {{underwent}} a change, with her new looks consisting of wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, gypsy skirts, silk Hermès head scarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public. Beltless, white jeans with a black turtleneck, never <b>tucked</b> <b>in,</b> but pulled down over the hips, was another fashion trend that she set.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines: the barong tagalog shirt {{has some}} {{features}} which {{are similar to}} the guayabera: it is long-sleeved, light, traditionally white, and worn without being <b>tucked</b> <b>in.</b> However, it lacks pleats or pockets, and is marked by intricate, hand-sewn embroidery in a variety of forms, including geometric or floral patterns. It is not traditionally made of linen, but rather of hand-woven, fine, translucent piña or jusi fiber. Less formal linen and cotton variants of the barong are used in everyday wear, such as school or office uniforms.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 {{director}} Paul Street {{created a}} commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from Bullitt. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic Fastback Mustang used in Bullitt, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> the corner, {{similar to that used}} in The Great Escape.|$|E

25|$|The sacred temples in Thailand {{follow a}} dress code, which is {{strictly}} followed. Men must wear long trousers and sleeved shirts and shoes; women must wear long skirts. Visitors who arrive dressed otherwise may rent appropriate clothing items at the entry {{area of the}} temple. It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, {{as a sign of}} respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> towards the back.|$|E
25|$|Although native {{populations have}} {{historically}} used {{areas around the}} mine and port for seasonal food-gathering there are no permanent residents at the mine or port site. The workforce consists of about 460 employees and contractors, of which somewhat more than half will be on-site at any given time. All staff work on a rotation, most on either a 4 weeks on/2 weeks off or 2 week on/1 week off schedule. At the mine, everybody stays in the single large housing unit, <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> among the process buildings {{near the edge of}} the open pit. A small portion of the work force stays at the port site. Contracted employees stay at the ConPac south of the main accommodations during the summer months. NANA shareholders comprise 56% of the mine's workforce.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} attire of the Nair men was the mundu, a cloth {{wrapped around}} the waist and then left to hang down nearly to the ground, rather than <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> as {{in other parts of}} India. The low-hanging fabric was considered as specific to the Nair caste, and {{at the start of the}} 20th century it was noted that in more conservative rural areas a non-Nair could be beaten for daring to wear a cloth hanging low to the ground. Wealthy Nairs might use silk for this purpose, and they also would cover their upper body with a piece of laced muslin; the remainder of the community used once to wear a material manufactured in Eraniyal but by the time of Panikkar's writing were generally using cotton cloth imported from Lancashire, England, and wore nothing above the waist. Nair men eschewed turbans or other head coverings, but would carry an umbrella against the sun's rays. They also eschewed footwear, although some of the wealthy would wear elaborate sandals.|$|E
