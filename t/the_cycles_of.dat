5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} to explain <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone {{in this endeavor}} was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} <b>the</b> ways <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> {{belief is}} revealed {{and its effect}} to the speaker. I am interested in finding out how <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is revealed and what effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief toward <b>the</b> speaker are. In my thesis, I use literary approach. Furthermore, I use the elements of poetry as the tools to reveal <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and its effects to the speaker. I also use the mythological background as the supporting concept. Through the analysis, I found out that <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is revealed through Proserpine?s figure and through the elements of poetry. I found out that Proserpine is mentioned through paradoxes and symbols in the beginning, {{and the end of}} the poem to reveal the paradoxical role of Proserpine. The speaker uses Proserpine to represent <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief. <b>The</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is also revealed through the elements of poetry. The use of metaphor of the sea describes <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and in this sea paganism and Christianity rise and sink by turns. The use of simile describes the situation of the people and the gods in <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief. <b>The</b> speaker also describes how <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief happens through the dictions, and he uses allusion, symbol and paradox to describe pagan gods, Christ, and Mary. I found that the transition from ancient Rome to Christianity has brought some effects to the speaker. He experiences loss and sadness. In his pain, he reproaches Christ and Mary and shows his refusal toward Christ. Through this analysis, I learn that a change is not always an improvement to all people in society...|$|R

5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary glacial cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged. They were thus {{affected}} by <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using environmental niche modelling and phylogeography showed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 21,000 years ago, crested and marbled newts likely survived in warmer refugia mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern marbled newt which expanded northwards and replaced the marbled newt. Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the Carpathian Basin during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E

At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice.

25|$|If a graph has a cycle double cover, <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> {{the cover}} {{can be used}} to form the 2-cells of a graph {{embedding}} onto a two-dimensional cell complex. In the case of a cubic graph, this complex always forms a manifold. The graph is said to be circularly embedded onto the manifold, in that every face of the embedding is a simple cycle in the graph. However, a cycle double cover of a graph with degree greater than three may not correspond to an embedding on a manifold: the cell complex formed by <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> the cover may have non-manifold topology at its vertices. The circular embedding conjecture or strong embedding conjecture states that every biconnected graph has a circular embedding onto a manifold. If so, the graph also has a cycle double cover, formed by the faces of the embedding.|$|E
