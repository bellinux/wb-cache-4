40|$|With the ever-growing {{demand for}} {{offshore}} wind energy, {{the number of}} submarine cables required to export the energy from wind farms to shore has also increased in recent times. These cables can be damaged when exposed on the sea bed, and thus need proper protection. Burial of these cables by use of a cable <b>trench</b> <b>plough</b> is one key technique to achieving such protection. A submarine cable <b>trench</b> <b>plough</b> {{can be used in}} various soil types, from hard boulder clay to loose sand. Because providing adequate protection is a critical factor in cable installation and the current calculation methods and theory use...|$|R
50|$|Le Couteur {{had many}} {{interests}} {{and was a}} competent artist. He undertook a sustained scientific study of wheat and produced several books on agriculture: On the Varieties, Properties, and Classification of Wheat (1836); On the Use of the Jersey <b>Trench</b> <b>Plough</b> (1842); On the Rise, Progress and State of Agriculture in Jersey (1852). In recognition of his enquiries, Le Couteur was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1843.|$|R
30|$|Until {{the ideal}} future {{solution}} of disease resistance becomes a reality, attempts to manage oil palm plantations {{will continue to}} be predominantly centred on BSR control by removing diseased material to prevent root contact from infected trees. This is done through isolation <b>trenching,</b> <b>ploughing,</b> harrowing, clearing, burning and fallowing before replanting the soil with seedlings. Sanitation remains the single most important measure at this time in the wait for Ganoderma resistant palms.|$|R

50|$|Many modern land drains {{are created}} utilising rigid or {{flexible}} plastic pipes pierced with holes, laid in pea gravel. (The pea gravel is pea-sized pebbles without sharp points {{to damage the}} pipe.) Geotextile material can surround the gravel to keep out silt. This can be installed in an excavated <b>trench.</b> Specialised mole <b>ploughs</b> are available that can form the hole, insert the perforated pipe (and gravel if required), all in one simultaneous and continuous process. An extremely powerful (usually tracked) tractor is necessary. The flexible pipe is carried as a roll {{on the back of}} the machine. There is a sometimes a hopper for gravel which is kept topped up by an adjacent machine. The pipe and gravel go down apertures in the plough blade as the tractor proceeds along the desired route.|$|R

40|$|The Offshore wind {{industry}} harvests {{energy in}} offshore locations, using large turbines to convert this energy to electrical power. The electricity is gathered and transported to shore via cables. These cables {{need to be}} protected from external hazards that could result in damages and thus economic losses. Generally the cables are buried in the seabed or covered with solid objects like rocks or concrete matrasses. For cable burial a trench needs to be created in the seabed, this process is called trenching. Tideway acquired a trenching vehicle to enable provision of a wider range of cable protection solutions besides rock placement. Instead of more familiar <b>trenching</b> <b>ploughs,</b> this machine is equipped with a track drive and is self-propelling. To create trenches the vehicle has two options, mechanical cutting and jetting. Expected progress rates of the vehicle are to be determined to make a more realistic assessment of the expected project durations in the pre-execution stages. This can only be done if specific knowledge regarding the interaction between seabed soils and track drive is available. Further-more it is interesting to look at the most optimal setup of the vehicle for each project, make the machine work more efficiently and decrease the trenching duration. The current thesis proposes a model that can assess the trench production rates for a tracked trenching vehicle. Inputs for the model are CPT results, operational conditions and general vehicle specifications. Furthermore, the model considers the fact that the vehicle has a limited amount of power onboard. The sensitivity of the model parameters and impact on production is analyzed via a tool created specifically for Tidewayâ€™s subsea trencher. The project is based on a review of literature regarding soil mechanics, soil cutting and Terra-mechanics. Using this knowledge the model is developed considering a rest state and a steady driving state of the vehicle. The final model incorporates several sub-models, accounting for the resistant-, thrust forces, slopes and more. Phenomena as shear displacement and slip are incorporated and build towards the output for the model, a forward speed of the vehicle while cutting. The model can include seabed slopes and layered homogeneous soils. The presence of boulders, currents and effects of acceleration/braking are outside the scope of this thesis. Based on the developed model a software algorithm is developed in the open-source programming language Python. This algorithm generates a working area which indicates the zone within which all operational and machine boundaries are fulfilled. Additionally an optimal working-point is also suggested. This point corresponds to the given combination of operational and vehicle specifications, where the machine operates at a desired efficiency. Several conclusions are drawn, accompanied with recommendations regarding optimization of the model and industry procedures. The goal of thesis has been achieved, by developing the model and the tool. A validation process based on measured field data shows that the several (sub) models are within range of the measured data.

40|$|Abstract. Nickel base Ni 60 and cobalt base Co-Cr-W {{coatings}} {{were prepared}} on substrate of refractory alloy steel 4 Cr 14 NiW 2 Mo by laser-cladding technology. A 2 kW transverse-flowing CO 2 laser device {{was used for}} cladding alloy powder. Another Co-Cr-W coating was formed by bead welding. Under room temperature, 250 oC. and 420 oC, reciprocate sliding wear tests with a ball-on-flat contact for three coatings have been carried out. For the laser cladding coating, a good metallurgical bonding with the substrate was obtained. Different tribological behaviors of three coatings were observed. For the two Co-Cr-W coatings, the friction coefficients decreased {{with the increase of}} test temperature, and larger spot-like stripping pit and wider <b>ploughing</b> <b>trenches</b> in the wear scars were presented. The wear mechanism was the combination of abrasive wear, delamination and oxidation wear. For the Ni 60 laser cladding layer, the friction coefficient hardly changed with the elevated temperature, and the wear mechanism mainly performed as abrasive wear due to its high oxidation resistance. The wear tests showed that the Ni 60 clad coating had provided excellent wear resistance than Co-Cr-W layers under high temperature reciprocating sliding wear condition...|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic marine {{incursion}} (5000 - 2300 B. C.) deposited sands and clays in {{the western}} Netherlands at a level about 4 metres below mean sea-level which could be easily studied in the Haarlemmermeer Polder. Some incursions and their sediments were traced in the terrain (Old Holocene sand, Hoofddorp deposits, Old Marine clay and Beinsdorp deposits); a small regression period allowed soil formation (decalcification on the Hoofddorp deposits). In the Subboreal and Subatlantic period, peat started to grow {{on top of the}} marine deposits, interrupted by marine incursions; in Medieval times the peat was eroded and three lakes were formed, which afterwards coalesced into one great lake. This lake threatened to destroy the central part of Holland together with the town of Amsterdam and was finally pumped out and reclaimed in 1853. Granular composition and CaCO 3 content determined suitability for crop production. The eroded peat was deposited as peat detritus in many places. There the topsoils were black and N manuring was not necessary, because of good nitrification. Sugarbeet produced less sugar on these soils. Apart from this, cat clay formation (causing low pH values) and seepage (mainly saline) were studied. Often deep <b>trenching</b> or deep <b>ploughing</b> was necessary to get a calcareous topsoil. <p/...|$|R
