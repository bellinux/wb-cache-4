5|$|Ferris and {{his friends}} collect the Ferrari and depart for home, but shortly {{discover}} many miles {{have been added to}} the odometer, and Cameron becomes catatonic. Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets the car on blocks and runs it in reverse <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> miles off the odometer without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly kicking the car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race in reverse through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E
5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{also depends}} on the relative strengths of the team's batting and bowling. For instance in Test Cricket, a side with only fast bowlers may choose to bowl first <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of any early moisture in the pitch, knowing {{that it will be}} harder to take wickets later in the match. Similarly a side with a weak opening batting pair may choose to bowl first in order to protect their batsmen.|$|E
25|$|Australia started slowly losing 4-64 before 56 from George Bailey and cameos {{down the}} order helped Australia to a mediocre 217.

25|$|At {{the conference}} however, {{there was still}} much dissension.

25|$|The {{timing of}} the ride is <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} of generally favourable weather {{at the start of}} summer in Victoria, with warm days, mild nights, relatively little rainfall and less wind than at other times of year. Despite expected mild conditions, severe weather can nonetheless be common, ranging from temperatures in excess of , heavy rainfall and thunderstorms, and cold windy conditions. For example, the 2012 ride saw seventeen riders hospitalised with fears of hypothermia due to the wet and cold on day four, while just a matter of days both before and after this many riders struggled with the heat when temperatures reached the high-30s.|$|E
25|$|On 12 July, the 21st Panzer Division {{launched}} a counter-attack against Trig 33 and Point 24, which was beaten off after a 2½-hour fight, {{with more than}} 600 German dead and wounded left strewn {{in front of the}} Australian positions. The next day, 21. Panzerdivision {{launched a}}n attack against Point 33 and South African positions in the El Alamein box. The attack was halted by intense artillery fire from the defenders. Rommel was still determined to drive the British forces from the northern salient. Although the Australian defenders had been forced back from Point 24, heavy casualties had been inflicted on 21st Panzer Division. Another attack was mounted on 15 July but made no ground against tenacious resistance. On 16 July, the Australians—supported by British tanks—launched an attack <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Point 24 but were forced back by German counter-attacks, suffering nearly fifty percent casualties.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E
25|$|Francis M. Walker's men, which {{included}} his 19th Tennessee Infantry {{as well as}} Maney's old brigade, had not been engaged that day since they had been marched and countermarched almost back to their original position. Cleburne placed Walker's brigade on the left front of the attacking force. The attack was launched with about 3,500 men in total, with 2,000 more in a second wave, at about 6:00p.m. Cleburne himself led the attack with Walker's brigade. The Union force had about half {{the number of men}} but they were behind their defenses. Emerging from a stand of woods, Walker's men were hard hit and began to retreat before Cleburne and Maney rallied them. Then they moved with a two-sided assault with troops to their right toward the Union line. Despite taking about 100 casualties in their previous advances, Walker's men followed Walker, who was waving his sword in encouragement, toward the crest of the hill. As they reached the crest, Walker's brigade was hit with a tremendous volley from defenders over the crest. Walker was killed by that volley. He had been appointed a brigadier general the previous day but he had not yet received written notification of his appointment. Walker's commission arrived at his headquarters the day after he was killed. After Walker's death, many of his men diverted to another point of attack <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a Union battery and suffered severe casualties. As night fell, the Confederates could not continue the attack and the Union troops held their fort {{at the top of the}} hill. The Confederates had sustained over 600 casualties while the Union defenders had endured about 550 casualties in the Battle of Bald Hill, which was but a small part of the overall Battle of Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|Richery {{made for}} St. John's, {{estimating}} {{that with his}} superior firepower, he could pound Fort Amherst into submission. However, upon entering the harbour, {{he would have to}} contend with the three smaller forts William, Waldegrave, Chainrock, a guard tower, and one of the largest fortresses in North America, Fort Townshend. Therefore, landing on the interior of the harbour was not seen as a feasible goal. Outnumbered at sea, the British retired behind the forts and batteries of St. John's and prepared to put up stiff resistance. It was the morning of 2 September 1796 when the French fleet was sighted off the coast. Wallace did not have a large garrison in St. John's at the time, so he tried {{to give the impression that}} he had. This was intended to make the French believe that St. John's would be too costly <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> He had his men erect tents on both sides of the entrance to the Narrows and then marched them to and fro at Fort Amherst and below Signal Hill. Richery was handicapped by having no intelligence of the defenses of St. John's and no pilots for Newfoundland waters. He had to depend for information on John Morridge, master of a fishing ship belonging to Governor Wallace, who was one of the prisoners taken at Bay Bulls. Richery's huge fleet hove to off Cape Spear for a day observing the daunting sight. The next morning, Richery formed a battle line and drove for the harbour entrance. As they came within the range of the twenty-four pounders at Fort Amherst, his resolve weakened. Tacking the great ships, he headed back out to sea. The ruse had worked and the town saved. Admiral Richery's threat to St. John's finally came to nothing in face of the vigour of the new Governor, Admiral Sir Richard Wallace, who raised volunteers, strengthened the forts, and prepared new batteries.|$|E

Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?"
