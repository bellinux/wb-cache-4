5|$|To collect water, on 20 June, Bidar Bakht {{and his men}} headed towards Jajau {{without knowing}} that Bahadur Shah was camped there. He came across a village where he found a flowing stream of water. To inform Azam Shah, he sent his messenger, Iradat Khan, to him with the message. When he returned, he {{informed}} Bidar Bakht {{that he had seen}} Bahadur Shah's advance tents. Khan Alam Dakhvini and Munavvar Khan, who were in charge of the central wing of the troops, were dispatched to attack <b>the</b> <b>tents.</b> Azim-ush-Shan's 500 elephants failed to mount a resistance against the invading forces. The attackers looted <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> and then set them on fire.|$|E
5|$|When the Romans {{set up a}} {{temporary}} castra, two maniples (without their velites) were selected to pitch <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> of the headquarters and officers, and details were made for fatigue duty, to get wood and water, and to give food and water to the animals accompanying them. The rest of the men, excepting velites and officers, set up <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> of the soldiers. During this time the velites would guard {{the outside of the}} wall and the wall itself, {{while the rest of the}} troops would guard the interior. The watch, which was composed of eight men led by a decurion, ran from 6 am to 6 pm, and was divided into four shifts, each of three hours.|$|E

50|$|Camper Sally Lowe gave {{evidence}} that she had brought Chamberlain's son Reagan out of <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> after <b>the</b> occurrence. When she was in <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> she observed {{a pool of blood}} in <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> about 15 cm by 10 cm. However, the amount of blood was disputed. Another witness who entered <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> that night, police Constable Frank Morris, gave {{evidence that}} {{there were only a few}} drops of blood on a couple of blankets and a sleeping bag in <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> inner <b>tent</b> {{comprises}} <b>the</b> main {{living and}} sleeping area of <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b> For double skin <b>tents,</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>tent</b> (often mesh) is not waterproof {{since it is}} protected by the rain fly. For single skin <b>tents,</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>tent</b> is often made of waterproof-breathable material that prevents liquid water from penetrating the inside of <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> but still allows water vapour to be transported out.|$|R
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E
5|$|In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men {{he brought}} into the battle, more than 30 percent of his army, {{including}} five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all <b>the</b> <b>tents.</b> Frederick required his generals {{to set an example}} of courage and leadership: they led from the front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 flags, and two standards. On the positive side, Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.|$|E

Her view of its nose was obscured. She cried [...] "Michael, Michael, the dingo's got my baby!" [...] and ran into <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> {{to check on her}} children. Azaria was missing. She chased in the direction she thought it had gone, and called out to her husband for a torch.|$|R

5|$|Amidst the {{backdrop}} of the Battle of Britain, while stationed on Salisbury Plain the battalion carried out garrison duties and undertook training to enable them to rapidly respond in the event that an invasion took place. They received a large amount of new equipment during this time to improve their mobility, including new Universal carriers, weapons and lightweight personal load carrying equipment. They also experienced German air attacks for the first time, and on 8 July 1940, the battalion incurred its first casualty when one of its members was wounded in an air raid. In early October, the 2/10th undertook a large-scale exercise near Tidworth, and then {{in the middle of the}} month, as winter set in they were moved to Colchester, where they replaced <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> they had been living in with the stone buildings and Nissen huts of Hyderabad Barracks. The battalion's stay there was short-lived, though, for the following month, after the threat of invasion had passed, the order arrived for the Australians to embark for the Middle East. The 2/10th subsequently entrained at Colchester in mid-November and moved north to Scotland where, on 17 November, they boarded the Straithaird.|$|E

Mrs. Banau says that she has not. Archie is {{impressed}} by her calm certainty, and concludes that no one entered <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> from <b>the</b> back. Someone must have gone in from the platform, stabbed Holt, and then opened the rear flap to make it appear as though the killer came from that direction, not from the platform.|$|R

50|$|The US Patent Office granted Sibley his patent April 22, 1856 (no. 14,740). The US Army used <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> {{exclusively}} during <b>the</b> Utah Expedition {{during the}} winter of 1857-58, proving the design. Several of the Plains Indian Wars veterans noted <b>the</b> <b>tent's</b> similarity to Indian lodges—the smoke hole, <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> pegs around <b>the</b> outer edge, the fire pit, etc.|$|R
25|$|To supply <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> {{with natural}} gas, a four-kilometer long network of gas lines was built. The gas {{consumption}} amounts to 180,000 cubic meters for the kitchens of various catering establishments, and 20,000 cubic meters {{to heat the}} beer gardens. Most festival tents and rides use green electricity from Stadtwerke München to reduce pollution.|$|E
25|$|Only after {{extensive}} reconnaissance of the Umayyad camp by Frankish soldiers – {{which by}} both historical accounts {{had been so}} hastily abandoned that even <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> remained, as the Umayyad forces headed back to Iberia with what loot remained that they could carry – was it discovered that the Muslims had retreated during the night.|$|E
25|$|The hall is {{surrounded}} by 114tents, which are occupied from May to September, {{as has been the}} case since 1869. Each tent is connected to a shed containing a kitchen and bathroom; the sheds are also used to store <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> during the winter. They are in such demand that there is a waiting list of some ten years for summer rentals.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> middle <b>tent</b> was {{destroyed}} completely by fire in 1953. The front of <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> was rebuilt during 1962 to 1964 {{under the leadership}} of palace architect Ragnar Hjorth. The buildings behind <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> façades were rebuilt in 1977-1978, following plans by palace architect Torbjörn Olsson. He turned the stableyard, formerly open, into a tent room with a ceiling. Today <b>the</b> middle copper <b>tent</b> is home to the Haga Park Museum. <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> to <b>the</b> east houses a restaurant and the one on the western side is accommodation. <b>The</b> copper <b>tents</b> are a national monument and protected under law.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> as a gastronomical {{facility}} {{dates back to}} 1867, when the Schottenhamel was a shack behind <b>the</b> Kings Royal <b>tent.</b> Today's festival managers are Michael F. and Christian Schottenhammel. <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> exists since 1953 and has an area of 4,800 m² with 6,000 seats and two galleries. 4,000 Seats are located outdoors {{in an area of}} 2,200 m². The first taping of the keg, by the Munich mayor, every Oktoberfest is held in <b>the</b> Schottenhamel <b>tent.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> is traditionally <b>the</b> home for the Munich student organizations, which can be seen also on the coat of arms with a compass located on <b>the</b> one <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> side walls. <b>The</b> crowds here are mostly young.|$|R
50|$|Later, Atanarjuat is in {{an unhappy}} {{marriage}} with two wives, Atuat and Puja, and has a young son by Atuat. Atuat and Amaqjuaq's wife Uluriaq complain that Puja is not helping with the daily work. Puja and Amaqjuaq are also having an affair. Puja apologizes, and suggests Atuat and Uluriaq leave to pick eggs, while Atanarjuat and Amaqjuaq retire to <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> to sleep. Alone outside <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> Puja places a boot against <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> to indicate who is sleeping on that side. She leaves, and Oki and his two henchmen sneak up and plunge their spears through <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> wall, killing Amaqjuaq. Instantly, Atanarjuat, naked, barefoot, and unharmed, bursts out of <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> and runs off across the ice.|$|R
25|$|On {{the early}} morning of 1 March, {{reportedly}} acting on evidence of firearms in the camp, the authorities moved in to inspect <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> set up by demonstrators. Law enforcement agents then violently dispersed the hundreds of protestors camped in. Ter-Petrosyan was placed under de facto house arrest, not being allowed to leave his home, though the authorities later denied the allegations.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s {{there was}} one {{gigantic}} train system comprising three separate train loads that brought the main show to the big cities. The first train load consisted of 22 cars and had <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> and the workers to set them up; the second section comprised 28 cars and carried the canvasmen, ushers and sideshow workers; the third section had 19 sleeping cars for the performers.|$|E
