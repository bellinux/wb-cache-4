5|$|Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music {{finally went}} to the United States {{district}} court on 23 February 1976, to hear evidence on <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> of plagiarism. Harrison attended the proceedings in New York, with a guitar, and each side called musical experts to support its argument.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{a case of}} {{copyright}} infringement was filed on the film's producer and director that prompted a court to stall the screening of the film. <b>The</b> <b>allegation</b> {{pointed out that the}} film was made based on a compilation of short stories that was released in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Days {{before the}} election, Morrow exposed a {{contract}} {{approved by the}} state Board of Control to purchase cloth from a man named A. S. J. Armstrong at twice its normal price. Black responded to <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> by temporarily suspending his campaign and ordering an investigation. The investigation revealed that Armstrong was a plumber who was bidding {{on behalf of his}} brother-in-law, a former prison official in the Stanley administration. Despite this revelation, Black refused to remove members of the Board of Control. This issue finally sank Black's candidacy; Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|It was {{a serious}} {{allegation}} to make against a physician. Reich wrote in his diary that the mother had been attracted to him and had made <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's partners to do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E
5|$|Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, {{a rapper}} and disc jockey {{living with his}} parents in Islington, London, N1. He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} {{for the first time to}} detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew <b>the</b> <b>allegation,</b> telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E
5|$|Official {{documents}} support <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> {{of interference}} by the 610 Office. In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels.|$|E
2500|$|Cosby has {{maintained}} his innocence and repeatedly denied <b>the</b> <b>allegations.</b> In November 2014, {{in response to}} a question about <b>the</b> <b>allegations,</b> Cosby said: [...] "I don't talk about it".|$|R

5|$|On 14August1942, Herring {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the defence of Brisbane. At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> reflected a suspicion that Herring was an elitist.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|Some contemporaries {{alleged that}} Bonaparte was put {{under house arrest}} at Nice for his {{association}} with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time). Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense {{in a letter to}} the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.|$|E
50|$|The Economist {{discussed}} Silva in 2011; Silva rejected <b>the</b> <b>allegations.</b> In February 2012, allegations {{aired on}} La Hojilla against opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski gained international coverage. Capriles rejected <b>the</b> <b>allegations.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{attempt to}} have Spofford tried {{was not the}} end of the dispute. In October 1878 Eddy's husband and another student, Edward Arens, were charged with conspiring to murder Spofford. A barman said they had offered him $500 to do it; after a complex series of claims and counter-claims, the charges were dropped when a witness {{retracted}} his statement. Eddy attributed <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> to a plot by former students to undermine sales of the second edition of Science and Health, just published. Her lawyer had to apply for an attachment order against her house to collect his fee.|$|E
5|$|The {{denomination}} {{with the}} longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the Catholic Church. The objections {{raised by the}} Catholic Church are based on <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is in conflict with Church doctrine. A number of Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry. The first was Pope Clement XII's In eminenti apostolatus, 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Leo XIII's Ab apostolici, 15 October 1890. The 1917 Code of Canon Law explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry entailed automatic excommunication, and banned books favouring Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> {{that the child was}} a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E

5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} published <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> that Lord Arthur Somerset, {{having learned}} {{in some way}} that 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and that he may have been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext {{in the hope that the}} police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|Murrell's fame greatly {{increased}} {{after his death}} when he was made the subject, albeit in a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> {{that he had the}} ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued {{to attract the attention of}} historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.|$|E
5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{because of}} the {{relatively}} limited number of potential consorts, the gene pool of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom or King Christian IX of Denmark. The House of Habsburg was infamous for inbreeding, with the Habsburg lip cited as an ill effect, although no genetic evidence has proved <b>the</b> <b>allegation.</b> The closely related houses of Habsburg, Bourbon, Braganza and Wittelsbach also engaged in first-cousin unions frequently and in double-cousin and uncle-niece marriages occasionally.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Street scandal {{occurred}} in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London, {{was discovered by}} police. The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> influenced {{the handling of the}} case by the authorities, and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accusation}} against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged {{that she had}} used a spell to cause {{the death of his}} bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{reported}} acts of sexual abuse involved fondling or unspecified abuse. There were allegations of forced acts of oral sex and intercourse.
