5|$|American policymakers, {{including}} Kennan and John Foster Dulles, {{acknowledged that}} <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> in its essence {{a war of}} ideas.

5|$|Enola Gay {{became the}} center of a {{controversy}} at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> a major political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|The Panavia Tornado is a multirole, twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{designed to}} excel at low-level penetration of enemy defences. The mission envisaged during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> {{the delivery of}} conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe; this dictated several significant features of the design. Variable wing geometry, allowing for minimal drag during the critical low-level dash towards a well-prepared enemy, had been desired from the project's start. Advanced navigation and flight computers, including the then-innovative fly-by-wire system, greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low-level flight and eased control of the aircraft. For long range bombing missions, the Tornado has a retractable refuelling probe.|$|E
5|$|The {{escalation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> highlighted by Truman's approval of NSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U.S. and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document {{was drafted by}} Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> high. A joint British and American operation to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.|$|E

25|$|The end of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> {{marked by}} the arrival of the YF-22A and the YF-23A.

The YF-22A was selected to become the Air Force's new advanced tactical fighter after a brief demonstration and validation risk reduction flight test program.

25|$|The year HUAC began {{investigating}} Hollywood {{is often}} considered {{the beginning of}} the Cold War, as in March 1947, the Truman Doctrine was announced. By about 1950, <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> in full swing, and the American public's fear of atomic warfare and communist influence was at a feverish level. The stage was set for Bradbury to write the dramatic nuclear holocaust ending of Fahrenheit 451, exemplifying the type of scenario feared by many Americans of the time.|$|E
25|$|The film {{also made}} many {{references}} to the political situation in Europe. Turkey, which was a neutral country during the war but a rival of the Soviet Union in <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> <b>was</b> portrayed {{as if it was}} an Axis state; the Turkish ambassador even greeted Hitler in the name of İsmet İnönü. The Nazi sympathies of Vatican ambassador Cesare Orsenigo were emphasized as well. Churchill, seen as an enemy after his 1946 Fulton Speech, was portrayed in a highly negative fashion.|$|E
25|$|In June, the Korean War {{broke out}} between {{communist}} North Korea (DPRK) supported by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea (ROK) {{supported by the}} United States and its allies in the UN. <b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> turning 'hot' in East Asia, and the American government feared communist domination of the entire region would have deep implications for American interests.

He then joined Stanford University's Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace's library as Senior Fellow in Slavic Studies and, in 1966, became a Senior Research Fellow at the institution. He also served as a visiting professor at Columbia University and the University of California. In 1973 Wolfe was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.|$|E
25|$|The {{foreign policy}} of Canada during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> closely tied {{to that of the}} United States. Canada was a {{founding}} member of NATO (which Canada wanted to be a transatlantic economic and political union as well). In 1950, Canada sent combat troops to Korea during the Korean War as part of the United Nations forces. The federal government's desire to assert its territorial claims in the Arctic during the Cold War manifested with the High Arctic relocation, in which Inuit were moved from Nunavik (the northern third of Quebec) to barren Cornwallis Island; this project was later the subject of a long investigation by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E

One of the major missions of the Bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials were dumped from dredging operations in U.S. ports. In 2013, the General Services Administration sold the Bold to Seattle Central Community College (SCCC), which demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose, at a nominal cost of $5,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{of the major}} types of board wargame, it {{was created by the}} game We the People {{published}} by Avalon Hill in 1994. In most aspects it is much like a typical board wargame (on the simpler side of the spectrum), but play is driven by a deck of cards that both players draw from. These cards control activation points, which allow the use of troops, as well as events that represent things outside the normal scope of the game. Newer card driven games have helped reinvigorate the war game genre as well as other differently themed games. Twilight Struggle, a game based on <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> <b>was</b> ranked #1 on the website BoardGameGeek from December 2010 to January 2016. As of April 2017, it's ranked third.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Chinese {{sentiment}} during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> {{largely the}} result of the Red Scare and McCarthyism. McCarthyism coincided with increased popular fear of communist espionage consequent to the Chinese Civil War and China's involvement in the Korean War. During the era, suspected Communists were imprisoned in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs. Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, did in fact have a past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party. But for the vast majority, both the potential for them to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous. Among these victims were Chinese Americans, who were suspected of being affiliated with the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China.|$|E
