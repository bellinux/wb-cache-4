40|$|Most of the Chinese {{students}} in Japan say it's too difficult <b>to</b> learn <b>Japanese.</b> Several characteristics are common <b>to</b> both <b>Japanese</b> and Chinese. For example, {{many of the}} Chinese characters used in Japan {{are the same as}} Chinese in their spelling and meanings. But, at the same time, the readings of them are quite different from that of Chiense frequently. The similarities and differences between the two language make it difficult <b>to</b> learn <b>Japanese</b> for Chinese students. In addition, "Hiragana" and "Katakana" are the unique characters only used in Japan. Foreign students must understand the three different kinds of characters, -Chinese character, Hiragana, Katakana-. So it takes them long time <b>to</b> master <b>Japanese...</b>|$|R

Several of the largest oil refineries halted oil product shipments from three refineries. Kyushu Railways postponed services on five lines, one of which crossed the entire prefecture.

5|$|After the Philippines fell <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{forces in}} 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued to farmers. Without {{any change in}} the Marihuana Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports of addiction, madness, and overt sexuality.|$|E
5|$|After this {{bout with}} the censors, Takechi vowed {{to produce a}} true, {{hardcore}} film for Japanese audiences. The result was Sacred Koya (Koya Hijiri), based on a work by Kyōka Izumi. He refused to allow the film to be censored in any way, either through cutting or fogging. Refusing to release the film in Japan, he did not submit it for Eirin's approval. Instead, he released it in Guam, where it played primarily <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> tourist audiences for several years under the U.S.'s more liberal pornography laws. Takechi's last film was another remake of Daydream in 1987, again starring Kyōko Aizome. Though it was a low-budget, independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan, it became very popular in its uncensored form in France.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction of the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul.

5|$|Aside from a {{comprehensive}} modernization in 1929–31, Arizona was regularly used for training exercises between the wars, including the annual Fleet Problems (training exercises).

In July 1934, the ship was featured in a Jimmy Cagney film, Here Comes the Navy, about the romantic troubles of a sailor.

5|$|Beginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism {{was brought}} to Japan from Baekje, new styles of shrine {{architecture}} were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin. The concept of temples {{as a place of}} assembly was applied to shrines. Spaces for worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (haiden) in addition to the main hall (honden). The following stylistic elements of Buddhist temple architecture were assimilated and applied <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.|$|E

5|$|Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan {{languages}} (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), {{also part}} of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war. As {{part of the}} Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, the ships were awarded to the victorious powers as war prizes.

Colmar saw one tour on colonial duty in Asia in 1924, where she participated in a multinational operation to protect foreign nationals from Chinese unrest in Shanghai. She was subsequently stricken in 1927 and broken up for scrap in Brest, France.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, Angkor Wat was not {{completely}} abandoned and functioned as a Buddhist temple. Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area testify <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which originally located {{in the kingdom of}} Magadha, India. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondafu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year at Angkor Wat in 1632.|$|E
