The last 10 overs of a one-day cricket match innings is often the most exciting part of the innings, because of the large number of boundaries scored and wickets taken.

25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Two</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{characteristic}} for the {{pressurized water}} reactor (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: coolant loop separation from the steam system and pressure inside the primary coolant loop. In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its liquid state as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the primary coolant loop is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a boiling water reactor (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the bulk fluid. By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the primary coolant is designed to boil.|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Economists also {{distinguish}} the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. [...] In this context, <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> assumed constant by {{definition of the}} short run: the availability {{of one or more}} fixed inputs (typically physical capital), and the number of firms in the industry. [...] In the long run, firms have a chance to adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long run potential competitors can enter or exit the industry in response to market conditions. [...] For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.|$|E

Martin Kemp, Professor of the History of Art at Oxford University, questions the rigor of Menzies' application of the historical method, and in regard to European illustrations purporting to be copied from the Chinese Nong Shu, writes that Menzies [...] "says something is a copy just because they look similar.

The head of the Roman goddess Minerva (Greek goddess Athena) appears {{in the center of}} an oval with an outside star pattern surrounding the whole. [...] Around the central figure are the French words [...] "Sous les lois de Minerve nous devenons tous frères" [...] (...) [...] [...] On a banner just above the central figure are the words [...] "St: of N: York" [...] and on a similar banner below the central figure appear the words: [...] "Union College 1795". The precise origins of the motto and the choice of Minerva as the fundamental element of the College seal are obscure, but <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> certain: like most colleges of the time, Union was deeply rooted in the classical tradition, but, unlike most colleges, Union chose a modern language rather than Latin for its motto. The resulting tone of the entire seal is thus historically aware, but distinctly modern in outlook.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} other controversies, Arthur Newell Strahler embeds {{peculiar}} anthropic distinctions {{in the name of}} naturalism: [...] "The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption." [...] Variously known as background independence, the cosmological principle, the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or uniformitarianism, there are important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by Stephen Jay Gould: [...] "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes. [...] It works the other way around." [...] You first assume these propositions and [...] "then you go to the out crop of rock." [...] "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way [...] "prove" [...] the validity of induction - an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)." [...] Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's [...] "uniformity of process" [...] are an assumption: [...] "As such, it is another a priori assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world." [...] Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: [...] "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation." [...] and according to R. Hooykaas: [...] "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts [...] [...] [...] It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for {{there is only one way}} in which <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different." ...|$|E

5000|$|If one states an {{equation}} between <b>two</b> <b>things,</b> one states, in effect, that they <b>are</b> the same <b>thing.</b> It can <b>be</b> {{argued that this}} cannot possibly be true, since one will then consider the properties which {{the two sides of}} the equation share - that which makes them [...] "equal" [...] - but one also can, and does, consider them as two separate concepts. Even in a mathematical statement as simple as [...] "x=x", one encounters fundamental differences between the two [...] "x"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct [...] "x"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one [...] "x". Secondly, that if <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality.
