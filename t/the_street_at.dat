5|$|Hillsboro's Civic Center is {{a modern}} glass {{building}} with a stone base and brick highlights. There are two main buildings, the Civic Center housing government offices and the Plaza Building housing retail space. The plazas surrounding the structures contain an inlaid quartzite river, basalt planters, and Victorian style benches. Additionally, it was designed with large windows facing the north in order to reflect the giant sequoia trees located across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> the Washington County Courthouse, with the trees {{dating back to the}} 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Madison Avenue {{is part of}} the {{cross-country}} US Route 20, and at four lanes wide it is {{the busiest}} street in the district. Roughly 90 buildings on Madison Avenue face the park. East of the intersection with Robin Street, Madison is more urban with 19th-century rowhouses; west of Robin Street is dominated by large detached residences, many of which have been converted to medical offices. A few buildings, such as 694 and 710 Madison predate park improvements that occurred across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> the Taylor property, which later became basketball and tennis courts. 682 Madison was formerly the home of the Academy of Holy Names. It is currently administrative offices for the Albany Medical Center Annex.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a railway}} {{station on the}} Gjøvik Line also called Nydalen, that is served by NSB Gjøvikbanen {{as part of the}} Oslo Commuter Rail. It is located many hundred meters from the metro station, and the two do not offer inter{{connection}}s. There is a shorter connection to the Gjøvik Line at Storo (that connects with Grefsen Station). Nydalen also serves several bus routes. Line 37 via the city center to Helsfyr operates from across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> Nydalen, while additional buses are located somewhat further away. They consist a feeder service to Lillo Terrasse (line 55) as well as lines 30 to Bygdøy, 51 to Maridalen and 58 to Helsfyr.|$|E

The firefighters were brought to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor. There were attempts at resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful and the firefighters were pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|While {{at work on}} The Songlines between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin {{frequently}} {{came down}} with colds. He also developed skin lesions {{that may have been}} symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>At</b> a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E
5|$|In 1732, John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins. It now forms {{one of the}} {{buildings}} making up Redland High School for Girls. In 1760, the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. That led to the demolition of St Nicholas's Gate, along with the original St Nicholas church, part of the Old Shambles, and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge. The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure, lined with houses on both sides. A 17th-century illustration shows that these were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>At</b> {{the time of the}} Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths, who may have been attracted by the unusually secure premises. The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762–9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt.|$|E

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>at</b> night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E
