500|$|With the <b>transportation</b> <b>tax</b> set {{to expire}} in 2006, a revived Proposition 400 was put before {{the voters of}} Maricopa County in 2004, {{ten years after the}} {{original}} vote ended in failure. [...] Proposing an identical half-cent extension of the sales tax, the new proposition would extend the tax a full twenty years as opposed to the original ten. [...] Unlike its predecessor, the proposition passed by a wide 58-42% margin and established funding for several future projects including highways and mass transit. [...] A similar but much more wide-reaching proposal to enact a full one-cent sales tax increase over a thirty-year period on a statewide level, much of which would have gone to funding Phoenix area projects, failed to qualify for the 2008 general election ballot due to issues with the petition.|$|E

5000|$|Countywide sales <b>taxes</b> for <b>transportation</b> {{purposes}} {{are very}} popular in California. However, <b>transportation</b> sales <b>taxes</b> are regressive and also shift the financial base of transportation systems from user fees to taxes paid by all taxpayers without regard to direct reliance on those transportation systems. [...] County <b>transportation</b> sales <b>taxes</b> are typically supported (including with significant campaign contributions) by interest groups that disproportionately benefit from the tax, including the local business community, the construction industry, real estate developers, and public employee unions. [...] Some counties have passed multiple <b>transportation</b> sales <b>taxes</b> increases such as Los Angeles County that has passed four <b>transportation</b> sales <b>tax</b> increases for a combined rate of 2.0%. [...] County <b>transportation</b> sales <b>taxes</b> generally do not include traffic performance standards that actually require improved traffic conditions.|$|R

A welfare analysis taking their strategic behaviour into account is conducted.

50|$|The {{preceding}} tie-in initiative example involving local <b>transportation</b> sales <b>taxes</b> {{could also}} be utilized {{in the context of}} improved mass transit usage with the continued imposition of the sales tax contingent on satisfaction of mass transit ridership benchmarks at specified time intervals. Local <b>transportation</b> sales <b>taxes</b> in California are often used to finance mass transit projects. Sometimes questionable mass transit ridership projections are given during the tax election campaign in support of a <b>transportation</b> sales <b>tax</b> measure. A tie-in initiative can serve as a tool to hold <b>transportation</b> sales <b>tax</b> supporters accountable if ridership projections don’t match actual numbers following approval of the tax.|$|R

50|$|The Los Angeles Metro {{passed a}} county wide measure {{expanding}} {{the county of}} Los Angeles' <b>transportation</b> <b>tax</b> for modernization of its infrastructure in 2008.

The Purple Line and Crenshaw/LAX connectors are to be completed in time for 2024. The transportation plans are already fully funded by LA County voters. A second measure, Measure M passed in November 2016 elections, this new measure will extend the <b>transportation</b> <b>tax</b> funds indefinitely and speed up many other projects with $120 billion in highway and transit projects over forty years, including a Sepulveda Subway line from the Valley to the Los Angeles westside thru the Sepulveda Pass.|$|E

5000|$|On August 22, 2008 The Chong Wa Dae, {{also known}} as the Blue house - the {{executive}} office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, confirmed a list of 40 new administrative strategy agenda, which included substitution of a carbon tax with the current <b>transportation</b> <b>tax.</b> Most revenues of the tax amounting to an annual $11 trillion won ($10.4 billion) will be financed toward the [...] "Low Carbon, Green Growth" [...] move, which was announced in President Lee Myung-bak's speech marking the nation's 63rd Liberation day the week before the announcement. A carbon tax is imposed on emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide. The direct taxation system is now applied to several European countries, such as Sweden, the Netherlands and Norway, as well as several states in North America. The temporary <b>transportation</b> <b>tax,</b> one of the major objective taxes in the country, is slated to end in 2009.

Belarus responded that if supplies were cut, it would deny Gazprom access to its pipelines, which would impair gas transportation to Europe. However, on 1 January 2007, {{just a few hours}} before the deadline, Belarus and Gazprom signed a last-minute agreement. Under the agreement, Belarus undertook to pay $100 per 1,000 cubic metre in 2007. The agreement also allowed Gazprom to purchase 50 percent of the shares in Beltransgaz, the Belarusian pipeline network.

5000|$|There {{are several}} other climate change {{adaptation}} finance proposals, most of which employ official development assistance or ODA.

40|$|This study explores ways {{to finance}} the City of Calgary’s {{transportation}} system. The city is currently experiencing difficulties in financing planned and approved transportation projects, resulting in a $ 1. 9 billion shortfall.

An examination of three jurisdictions is used to identify successful characteristics in financing an urban transportation system. Three policy options are born from these characteristics, and are evaluated on their ability to meet four criteria. Results indicate that a flexible <b>transportation</b> <b>tax</b> can help close the funding gap in Calgary’s transportation system, and improve the system as a whole for the foreseeable future.

50|$|Developing a BEV {{infrastructure}} {{would provide}} the advantage of virtually unrestricted highway range.

Unfortunately, private use of the existing electrical system is almost universally prohibited. Besides, the technology for such electrical infrastructure is largely outdated and, outside some cities, not widely distributed (see Conduit current collection, trams, electric rail, trolleys, third rail).

40|$|As {{funding from}} state and {{national}} sources has dwindled and demands for relief from traffic and congestion have grown, local governments and transportation agencies are increasingly left {{to develop their own}} sources of enhanced revenues. Frequently the bid to increase available revenues comprises a local ballot measure, enabling the citizens served by these governments and agencies to express their preferences for or against increased taxation in support of an improved transportation system. What determines the success of campaigns in support of such ballot measures? To answer this question, this report includes the use of two different approaches and data sources. 1) A statistical analysis of community-level characteristics. Data from localities across the nation, as well those within the state of California, that have conducted elections for <b>transportation</b> <b>tax</b> increase are analyzed to determine what factors seem to affect the outcome of such elections. 2) Case studies of four communities that recently conducted elections for <b>transportation</b> <b>tax</b> increases (Santa Clara and Sonoma Counties in California, and the Denver and Seattle metropolitan areas). The case studies allow for in-depth, qualitative understanding of what election strategies and other campaign elements comprise successful or unsuccessful efforts to raise local revenues. Among the most significant findings from the statistical analysis of local elections were the following: Efforts to fund transportation with taxes where the proportion of elderly is greater than 9 percent are more likely to succeed In communities where the percentage of elderly is greater than 9 percent, the analysis indicates that voters may be more willing to accept local transportation taxes. However, in communities where the percentage of elderly is less than 9 percent, transportation measures may require significantly more determined marketing to enhance the probability of passage. Efforts to increase sales taxes for transportation programs will be less successful in communities with higher sales taxes. A relatively strong and negative relationship between sales tax and support for <b>transportation</b> <b>tax</b> initiatives was identified in the national election data. This suggests that communities with relatively higher sales taxes will be hard pressed to convince citizens to support additional increases...|$|E
