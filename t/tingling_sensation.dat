5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation.</b> Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation</b> returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E

25|$|In auditory-tactile synesthesia, certain sounds can induce sensations {{in parts}} of the body. For example, someone with auditory-tactile synesthesia may {{experience}} that hearing a specific word feels like touch in one specific part of the body or may experience that certain sounds can create a sensation in the skin without being touched. It is one of the least common forms of synesthesia. However, some speculate that the common phenomenon of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), in which auditory stimuli or trigger words create a <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation</b> in the body without being touched, to be a form of auditory-tactile synesthesia, meaning that it could be more common than current statistics imply.|$|E

5000|$|A {{panic attack}} is a {{response}} of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The most common symptoms include trembling, dyspnea (shortness of breath), heart palpitations, chest pain (or chest tightness), hot flashes, cold flashes, burning sensations (particularly in the facial or neck area), sweating, nausea, dizziness (or slight vertigo), light-headedness, hyperventilation, paresthesias (<b>tingling</b> <b>sensations),</b> sensations of choking or smothering, difficulty moving, and derealization. These physical symptoms are interpreted with alarm in people prone to panic attacks. This results in increased anxiety and forms a positive feedback loop.|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken dock worker, looking for the thrill of a <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation</b> he had noticed before, managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, 2012, Bagwell {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} car accident. According to the Woodstock police report, Bagwell called his wife at 1:35 PM {{to tell her that}} he was about to suffer a seizure while driving. He was {{subsequently}} taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia, where he was placed in the hospital's intensive care unit after suffering broken bones in his neck, face and jaw. On April 24, fellow WCW alumnus and former tag team partner Scott Norton released a statement via Twitter to confirm that Bagwell was going to be all right. On April 25, Universal Championship Wrestling performer and Bagwell's brother John released a statement to confirm that Bagwell's condition was improving, but that he still required breathing and feeding tubes and would undergo surgery once the swelling in his face and neck subsided. On April 28, Bagwell's mother Judy revealed to TMZ that he had been taken off the breathing tube, was able to eat solid foods, and was able to talk. Fellow WCW alumni Sting, the Steiner Brothers, and Diamond Dallas Page have also kept in contact with Bagwell since his crash. On May 3, Universal Championship Wrestling announced via Twitter that Bagwell was able to walk again, but still had a <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation</b> in his arms and hands. UCW also stated that he had four plates surgically inserted in his face and that his jaw was wired shut after surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{individuals}} do not experience symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they usually take {{from four to}} six weeks from the time of infection. The first symptom of the disease may be a general feeling of illness. Within twelve hours of infection, an individual may complain of a <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation</b> or light rash, commonly referred to as [...] "swimmer's itch", due to irritation at the point of entrance. The rash that may develop can mimic scabies and other types of rashes. Other symptoms can occur two to ten weeks later and can include fever, aching, a cough, diarrhea, chills or gland enlargement. These symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis, which does not cause any further symptoms in humans.|$|E

40|$|The enigmatic <b>sensation</b> of <b>tingle</b> {{involves}} the activation of primary sensory neurons by hydroxy-α-sanshool, a tingly agent in Szechuan peppers, by inhibiting two-pore potassium channels. Central mechanisms mediating <b>tingle</b> <b>sensation</b> are unknown. We investigated whether a stable derivative of sanshool—isobutylalkenyl amide (IBA) —excites wide-dynamic range (WDR) spinal neurons that participate in transmission of chemesthetic {{information from the}} skin. In anesthetized rats, the majority of WDR and low-threshold units responded to intradermal injection of IBA in a dose-related manner over a > 5 -min time course and exhibited tachyphylaxis at higher concentrations (1 and 10 %). Almost all WDR and low-threshold units additionally responded to the pungent agents mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate) and/or capsaicin, prompting reclassification of the low-threshold cells as WDR. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} the functional role of WDR neurons in mediating <b>tingle</b> <b>sensation...</b>|$|R
50|$|Loprazolam, {{like all}} other benzodiazepines, is {{recommended}} only for the short-term management of insomnia in the UK, owing {{to the risk of}} serious adverse effects such as tolerance, dependence and withdrawal, as well as adverse effects on mood and cognition. Benzodiazepines can become less effective over time, and patients can develop increasing physical and psychological adverse effects, e.g., agorophobia, gastrointestinal complaints, and peripheral nerve abnormalities such as burning and <b>tingling</b> <b>sensations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Brachial plexus {{block is}} {{typically}} performed by an anesthesiologist. To achieve an optimal block, {{the tip of}} the needle should be close to the nerves of the plexus during the injection of local anesthetic solution. Commonly employed techniques for obtaining such a needle position include transarterial, elicitation of a paresthesia, and use of a peripheral nerve stimulator or a portable ultrasound scanning device. If the needle is close to or contacts a nerve, the subject may experience a paresthesia (a sudden <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation,</b> often described as feeling like [...] "pins and needles" [...] or like an electric shock) in the arm, hand, or fingers. Injection close to the point of elicitation of such a paresthesia may result in a good block. A peripheral nerve stimulator connected to an appropriate needle allows emission of electric current from the needle tip. When the needle tip is close to or contacts a motor nerve, characteristic contraction of the innervated muscle may be elicited. Modern portable ultrasound devices allow the user to visualize internal anatomy, including the nerves to be blocked, neighboring anatomic structures and the needle as it approaches the nerves. Observation of local anesthetic surrounding the nerves during ultrasound-guided injection is predictive of a successful block. Appropriate block per site-specific procedure are listed in the following table: ...|$|E
2500|$|Channelers can {{direct the}} Power toward a desired purpose by {{creating}} {{one or more}} [...] "flows" [...] of the One Power and constructing [...] "weaves" [...] of these flows. An individual flow can only consist {{of one of the}} Five Powers, but a weave can combine any number of flows from any of the five. Flows can be of varying sizes, with larger flows involving greater strength. Channelers, especially novices, are very careful to control the amount of the One Power they draw into their flows. Drawing too much can be fatal, or can [...] "burn out" [...] the channeler, severing their ability to access the One Power forever. Channelers can sense the power in others and feel when a channeler has [...] "embraced" [...] saidar or [...] "seized" [...] saidin, for female channelers, this is limited only to other women, whereas male channelers are able to 'feel' when a female channeler has embraced saidar, this is generally felt by a <b>tingling</b> <b>sensation.</b> It is also possible, for women, to sense the strength of a fellow channeler—defined as the potential amount of the One Power the channeler can draw and successfully weave unaided without burning out. Men are limited to sensing the amount of saidin currently drawn, but cannot tell if it's the channeler's maximum potential.|$|E
