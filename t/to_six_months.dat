5|$|Membership is conferred for life. Formerly, {{the death}} of a monarch ("demise of the Crown") brought an {{immediate}} dissolution of the Council, as all Crown appointments automatically lapsed. By the 18th century, it was enacted that the Council would not be dissolved until up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> after the demise of the Crown. By convention, however, the sovereign would reappoint all members of the Council after its dissolution. In practice, therefore, membership continued without a break. In 1901 the law was changed to ensure that Crown Appointments became wholly unaffected by any succession of monarch.|$|E
