5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting in <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria {{took the lead in}} establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E

5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E

The stories generally focus on the fortunes and personalities {{of a small group of}} protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story. Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a staple of the series. Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptions and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
5|$|When the 2013 festival {{began in}} Park City, Utah, the secrecy {{about the movie}} continued. The festival's website only {{identified}} the setting as a theme park. Nan Chalat-Noaker, critic for the Park Record, recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to see it. In her review, she declined to identify <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to the attendees, all the other shows were effectively sold out.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{related to the}} variational inequalities, we have <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> fixed points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonexpansive mappings, which is <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> current {{interest}} in functional analysis. It is natural to consider a unified approach to these two different problems. Motivated and inspired by the research going in this direction, Noor and Huang [43] considered <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> common element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solutions <b>of</b> variational inequalities and <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixed points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonexpansive mappings. Noor [38] suggested and analyzed some three-step iterative algorithms for finding <b>the</b> common elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Noor variational inequalities and <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixed points <b>of</b> nonexpansive mappings.

5|$|End of Ages {{takes place}} in the present day, {{sometime}} after the events of , and begins as the player responds to a letter from Atrus. Atrus is a writer of special volumes called linking books, which serve as portals or links to worlds known as Ages. A linking book to the Age of Myst, <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original game, lies sealed in the ruins of the ancient D'ni civilization. The D'ni had the ability to craft linking books, but their society crumbled from within; Atrus and his family have been trying to restore the D'ni people and created an Age for the survivors to live on, known as Releeshahn (introduced in Exile). Atrus by this period is an old man, mourning the deaths of his sons Sirrus and Achenar in Revelation, and the death of his wife Catherine in the period after. In his letter, Atrus expresses concern that his daughter, Yeesha, may be lost as well.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting, and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E
5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was {{symbolic of the}} high status of the Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became symbolic of the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, the time of <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt {{as a second language}} by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E
