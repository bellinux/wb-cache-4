5|$|The diets of {{both groups}} {{consisted}} mostly of shellfish and fish, small mammals, game, and wild plants. Having access only to soft limestone, most of the tools fashioned by Native Americans in the region were made of shell, bone, wood, and animal teeth; shark teeth were used as cutting blades, and sharpened reeds became arrows and spears. Shell mounds still exist today within the park, giving archaeologists and anthropologists evidence of the raw materials available to the indigenous people for <b>tool</b> <b>construction.</b> Spanish explorers estimated the number of Tequesta at first contact to be around 800, and Calusa at 2,000; the National Park Service reports there were probably about 20,000 natives living {{in or near the}} Everglades when the Spanish established contact in the late 16th century. The Calusa society was more advanced, as they lived in social strata, and were able to create canals, earthworks, and shellworks. The Calusa were also able to resist Spanish attempts at conquest.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} make and use tools was once {{considered}} a defining characteristic of the genus Homo. However, the discovery of <b>tool</b> <b>construction</b> among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded {{the notion of the}} use of technology as unique to humans. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging: some of the tools used include leaf sponges, termite fishing probes, pestles and levers.

25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, {{it has been}} hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes. The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions. Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans. This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which {{gave rise to the}} need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment. Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, <b>tool</b> <b>construction</b> and use, and effective communication.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, {{more than}} half a century after it was abandoned, the {{reconstruction}} project began. A team of marbleworkers from the island of Paros with experience of working on a similar project on the south side of Pendeli were called in. They had to unearth the unused paths, train tracks and other details of everyday working life in Aloula and then decide how to reconstruct and show them. They started by constructing a staircase to connect various functional areas of the quarry, such as the <b>tool</b> <b>construction</b> area, the sheer cliff, living quarters and the transportation area. Despite their experience, much of what we see today is more the product of modern decisions for the museum than any sort of archaeological research. They worked particularly hard at reconstructing the house of Aloula himself and were rewarded by finding a large number of rare old quarrying tools in the shed next to it.|$|E

50|$|The stick (also {{referred}} to as a 'bat' or 'pusher') for this sport is relatively short compared to that for Field/Ice/Roller hockey, and should be coloured either white or black in its entirety to indicate the player's team. The stick may only be held in one hand, which is usually determined by the player's handedness, although players may swap hands during play. The shape of the stick may affect playing style and is often a very personal choice. A wide variety of stick designs are allowed within the constraints of the rules of the game, the principal rules being that the stick must fit into a box of 100x50x350mm and that the stick must not be capable of surrounding the puck or any part of the hand. A rule concerning the minimum radius of edges tries to address the risk that the stick might become more of a weapon than a playing <b>tool.</b> <b>Construction</b> materials may be of wood or plastics and current rules now supersede those that previously required sticks to be homogeneous, although they almost always are anyway. Many players of UWH manufacture their own sticks to their preferred shape and style, although there are increasingly more mass-produced designs to suit the majority (such as Bentfish, Britbat, CanAm, Dorsal, Stingray etc.).|$|E
