He {{said that}} he was forced to make the {{announcement}} by some youngsters. <b>The</b> <b>priest</b> <b>said</b> that he had only announced that a cow had been killed and asked people to gather near the temple. On 3 October, a man named Vishal, the son of a local BJP leader Sanjay Rana, was arrested in connection to the case. By 4 October, Danish had spent 4 days in the Intensive Care Unit and undergone two brain surgeries. He had been admitted in Kailash Hospital, Greater Noida. Some female relatives of the arrested persons attacked journalists and pelted stones at media vans. They claimed that these persons had been wrongly arrested and the media was covering only the victim's story.|$|E
500|$|Many Michoacán natives {{believed}} that Moreno González was alive; he was {{widely believed to}} have made a public appearance in Morelia in 2012 after his son was killed in a motorcycle accident. According to an unnamed official, his sister went to the morgue to reclaim the body of his son before the autopsy. When the coroner refused to give her the body, Moreno González paid him a visit and convinced him to give up the body. In fears of reprisals, local media outlets self-censored and did not report on the death of his son. Those who wrecked his son were reportedly kidnapped by Moreno González men and killed. In addition, one militia leader from the town of Coalcomán reported seeing him dressed as Saint Francis of Assisi, baptizing people, and leading his henchmen. There was no concrete evidence of Moreno González being alive. However, since no autopsy was performed, {{there was no evidence of}} him being dead either. In January 2014, Gregorio López, a priest of Apatzingán, reported that Moreno González ordered a self-imposed curfew in the city and threatened to burn down businesses that did not comply with the order. That week Michoacán had a series of violent episodes after the state's autodefensa (vigilante) groups—which emerged in February 2013 to fight the Knights Templar Cartel—attempted to move into several municipalities to fight the cartel. <b>The</b> <b>priest</b> <b>said</b> in an interview that there were rumors that the drug lord met with [...] "La Tuta" [...] for lunch in La Cucha, a ranch outside of Apatzingán. In an interview with Noticias MVS in February 2014, the former self-defense group leader José Manuel Mireles Valverde stated that Moreno González celebrated Christmas Day (25 December 2013) with the cartel leader Enrique Plancarte Solís and his daughter and banda singer Melissa at the drug lord's house. Mireles claimed in March 2014 that the self-defense groups nearly captured Moreno González at a ranch close to Tumbiscatío, Michoacán, but that he managed to escape 20 minutes before their arrival.|$|E

2500|$|The phrase Ite, missa est [...] "Go, {{it is the}} dismissal" [...] (referring to the congregation) is {{the final}} part of the Ordinarium in the post-Tridentine Mass, but is omitted if another {{function}} follows immediately. In the Tridentine Mass, {{it was followed by}} a private prayer that <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> <b>said</b> silently for himself, by the final blessing, and by the reading of the Last Gospel (usually John 1:1-14), and in some Masses it was replaced by Benedicamus Domino or Requiescant in pace. These phrases are sung to music given in the Missal, as is the choir's response, Deo gratias or (after Requiescant in pace) Amen. Because of their brevity, the responses have seldom been set to polyphonic music except in early Masses such as the Messe de Nostre Dame by Machaut. The same holds for other short sung responses, such as Et cum spiritu, Gloria tibi, Domine, Habemus ad Dominum, and Dignum et iustum est.|$|E

[...] After the recitation by the server(s), <b>the</b> <b>priest</b> <b>said</b> the same prayer (with vestri and vestris, [...] "you" [...] plural, not [...] "you" [...] singular), and the server(s) answers: [...] "Amen." [...] In editions since 1970, in which the Confiteor is recited jointly, this prayer is said by the priest alone, replacing vestri and vestris ("you" [...] and [...] "your") with nostri and nostris ("us" [...] and [...] "our").
