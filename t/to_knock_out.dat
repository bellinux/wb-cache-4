However, both the aerial combat and X-Factor systems, introduced in Fate of Two Worlds, have received adjustments. In addition to gameplay modifications and new playable characters, the game features several aesthetic changes.|$|E
5|$|Players {{select one}} of several {{characters}} from the DC Universe to engage in combat, aiming <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> their opponent. The game {{is set in a}} 2.5D environment; while character models and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, the characters are restricted to fight within a two-dimensional space. Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality.|$|E
5|$|Tactical {{training}} {{emphasized that}} it was best utilized from a slit trench with surprise and concealment {{on the side of}} the PIAT team, and where possible enemy armoured vehicles should be engaged from the flank or rear. The PIAT was often also used in combat <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> enemy positions located in houses and bunkers. It was possible to use the PIAT as a crude mortar by placing the shoulder pad of the weapon on the ground and supporting it.|$|E

5|$|Although the PanzerI would {{participate}} {{in almost every}} major Nationalist offensive of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower. At one point, von Thoma offered up to 500pesetas for each T-26 captured. Although the Panzer I was initially able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> the T-26 at close range—150meters (165yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92millimeter bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the PanzerI.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1944 Rifleman Ganju Lama of the 7th Gurkha Rifles used a PIAT <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> two Japanese tanks attacking {{his unit}} at Ningthoukhong, Manipur, India (given as Burma in the {{official}} citation). Despite sustaining injuries, Ganju Lama approached within thirty yards of the enemy tanks, and having knocked them out moved on to attack the crews {{as they tried to}} escape. When asked by his Army Commander, William Slim, why he went so close, he replied he was not certain of hitting with a PIAT beyond thirty yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} three minutes <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> the opponent. After three minutes, the match ends, and the player loses; the player cannot win by a decision. After losing, the player {{can use a}} {{continue}} and fight a rematch. The game ends after all continues have been used; the player must fight all opponents in the current circuit again. The game consists of four circuits in which the player must become the champion. The player can retry any circuit {{that has already been}} beaten. The game has a battery–backed memory in which players can save their data and records for future play.|$|E

5|$|It still {{came as a}} {{shock to}} the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks {{attacked}} their camp. The Soviet-built PT-76 amphibious tanks of the 203rd NVA Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> at least five of the tanks.|$|E
5|$|Mickl {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion during the invasion. He got along well with Rommel, and his battalion fought well but suffered serious casualties during the Battle of Arras on 21 May while trying to stop the heavily armoured tanks of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade with its 37 mm anti-tank guns. His soldiers derided their guns as Panzeranklopfgerät (tank-door knocker), due to their failure to penetrate the British Matilda I and Matilda II tanks. Mickl's battalion tried to protect the exposed flank of the division, but was overrun. The situation was saved by anti-aircraft guns and field artillery which were able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> the British tanks with direct fire.|$|E
5|$|Shoup later {{warned against}} an armed {{response}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis, noting {{how difficult it}} would be to invade the country. Still, he prepared a team of Marines to invade Cuba should it be necessary. He and the other Joint Chiefs unanimously recommended a quick airstrike <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> the missiles once they were discovered there. Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E

5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} {{the attacks on}} airfields in south-western England which they had started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The concentration on Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and bore no relation to Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through the attacks on 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August had failed <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> these strips, and Adlertag had failed to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, attacks on other targets had failed or been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The USAAF XIX Tactical Air Command had {{established}} a strong presence in northeast France and was supporting the U.S. 3rd Army. JG 53 was <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> its airfields. Some 26 Bf 109s took off but were intercepted by 12 P-47s of the 367th Fighter Squadron, 358th Fighter Group. The P-47s claimed 13 destroyed, one probable and six damaged for no losses. On the way home at 09:20, III./JG 53 were intercepted by 366th Fighter Squadron. Altogether, III./JG 53 lost 10 Bf 109s and one damaged to the 358th Fighter Group. Of the 25 III./JG 53 Bf 109s that took part, 11 were shot down representing 40% of the attacking force. The 358th Fighter Group received the Distinguished Unit citation for preventing {{the attack on the}} 362nd Fighter Groups airfield.|$|E
5|$|The Ulm Campaign was {{a series}} of French and Bavarian {{military}} maneuvers and battles to outflank and capture an Austrian army in 1805 during the War of the Third Coalition. It took place in the vicinity of and inside the Swabian (then Bavarian) city of Ulm. The French Grande Armée, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, comprised 210,000 troops organized into seven corps, and hoped <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> the Austrian army in the Danube before Russian reinforcements could arrive. Through rapid marching, Napoleon conducted a large wheeling maneuver that captured an Austrian army of 23,000 under General Mack on 20 October at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential {{in the development of the}} Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century.|$|E

Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props for faking the execution, but no money or valuables {{appear to have been}} stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.|$|E
5|$|American {{casualties}} were climbing, both from frequent German counterattacks {{and the cost}} of storming pillboxes. The Germans had spent the night of 10 October turning cellars of houses in the town of Bardenberg into fortified pillboxes; American attackers were forced to withdraw and instead shell the town into submission. On 12 October, the Germans launched a major counterattack against the American 30th Infantry Division. It was disrupted by heavy artillery fire and well-placed anti-tank defenses. At the village of Birk, a three-hour fight broke out between German tanks and a single American Sherman; the Sherman managed <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> an enemy Panzer IV and force another one to withdraw, but was soon attacked by others. This lone tank was eventually joined by elements of the 2nd Armored Division, and the Germans were driven from the town. The 30th Infantry Division soon found itself in defensive positions all along its front; nevertheless, it was ordered to continue pushing south for its intended link-up with the 1st Infantry Division. To accomplish this, two infantry battalions from the 29th Infantry Division were attached to the hard-pressed 30th.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters {{at the beginning of}} a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag in the off-screen character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
