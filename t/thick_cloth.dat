25|$|Athena {{is wearing}} a peplos that is open on the right side. The cloth of the peplos appears heavy, as {{evidenced}} from the deep cloth lines in the sculpture. The heavy material hints that the statue was not from {{early in the fourth}} century, but probably towards the middle, since earlier in the fourth century, luxurious transparent cloth was the style. Here, on the other hand, we see Athena wearing a peplos made from <b>thick</b> <b>cloth</b> that became fashionable later during the fourth century, according to the scholar, John Pedley. The heavy cloth is also noted to re-emphasize her physical presence.|$|E
25|$|The chlamys, a semicircular cloak {{fastened}} to the right shoulder continued throughout the period. The length fell sometimes only to the hips or {{as far as the}} ankles, much longer than the version commonly worn in Ancient Greece; the longer version is also called a paludamentum. As well as his courtiers, Emperor Justinian wears one, with a huge brooch, in the Ravenna mosaics. On each straight edge men of the senatorial class had a tablion, a lozenge shaped coloured panel across the chest or midriff (at the front), which was also used to show the further rank of the wearer by the colour or type of embroidery and jewels used (compare those of Justinian and his courtiers). Theodosius I and his co-emperors were shown in 388 with theirs at knee level in the Missorium of Theodosius I of 387, but over the next decades the tablion can be seen to move higher on the Chlamys, for example in ivories of 413-414. A paragauda or border of <b>thick</b> <b>cloth,</b> usually including gold, was also an indicator of rank. Sometimes an oblong cloak would be worn, especially by the military and ordinary people; it was not for court occasions. Cloaks were pinned on the right shoulder for ease of movement, and access to a sword.|$|E

50|$|The Windsor knot {{is named}} after the Duke of Windsor, {{although}} he did not invent it. The Duke did favour a voluminous knot; however, he achieved this by having neckties specially made of <b>thicker</b> <b>cloths.</b>|$|R
50|$|The knot {{is often}} {{thought to be}} named after the Duke of Windsor (King Edward VIII before his abdication). It is likely, however, that it was invented by his father, George V. The Duke {{preferred}} a wide knot and had his ties specially made with <b>thicker</b> <b>cloth</b> {{in order to produce}} a wider knot when tied with the conventional four-in-hand knot. The Windsor knot was invented to emulate the Duke's wide knot with ties made from normal thickness cloth.|$|R

60|$|Because she {{had nothing}} else to do, Carol went. But she was uncomfortable in the {{presence}} of the amused stares which Mrs. Flickerbaugh's raiment drew.

60|$|Then he {{went into}} the stall, and with one blow of the axe killed the calf, and with the second split its brain. In an instant the place was filled with light, as the red ball fell from the brain of the calf.

60|$|The {{others who}} had entered along with this man did not move from the door--at least, if they did so, {{there was no sound}} of footsteps. The man who had spoken went to the window and spread a <b>thick</b> <b>cloth</b> over it. Gascoyne could see this, because there was {{sufficient}} light outside to make the arms of the man dimly visible as he raised them up to accomplish his object. The cell was thus rendered, if possible, more impenetrably dark than before.|$|E

With it were worn tight-fitting stockings of cloth, and low shoes.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of {{footsteps}} Swithin beat a hasty retreat up-stairs, where he struck a light, and revealed a table covered with books and papers, while round the walls hung star-maps, and other diagrams illustrative of celestial phenomena. In a corner stood a huge pasteboard tube, which a close inspection would have shown to be intended for a telescope. Swithin hung a <b>thick</b> <b>cloth</b> over the window, {{in addition to the}} curtains, and sat down to his papers. On the ceiling was a black stain of smoke, and under this he placed his lamp, evidencing that the midnight oil was consumed on that precise spot very often.|$|E

Ibrahim had also {{purchased}} two very large, dark blankets, {{that could be used for}} a temporary shelter. Surajah now felt quite at home, for he was engaged in the same sort of duty he performed at Tripataly; and more than one pair of dark eyes glanced admiringly at the two young officers, as they rode down to the ford.|$|R

60|$|True to his determination, Ulpius, {{with part of}} {{the wages}} which he had hoarded in Numerian's service, had {{procured}} a small lantern from a shop {{in one of the}} distant quarters of Rome; and veiling its light in a piece of coarse, <b>thick</b> <b>cloth,</b> had proceeded by the solitary pathway to his second night's labour at the wall. He arrived at the breach, at the commencement of the dialogue above related, and heard with delight the sentinel's noisy resolution to amuse his companion in spite of himself.

60|$|The {{lights in}} the village went out, house after house, till there only {{remained}} two in the darkness. One of these came from a residence on the hill-side, of which {{there is nothing to}} say at present; the other shone from the window of Marty South.

Waterdrops disappear more quickly in the case of <b>thick</b> <b>cloths</b> made of double yarn. 3. Double and single yarn samples differ in behavior. 4. The cloths and their material yams differ in the water-absorption behavior. 5. Unlike the single capillary phenomenon, there exists the best capillary condition. 6.

60|$|An {{hour after}} leaving the village, as they were passing through a thick grove of trees some figures rose as from the ground.

60|$|Mother, {{put your}} trust in God to guard my head. If my grave lies in France {{it can never}} be in the Punjab, though we try for a {{thousand}} years. If it be in the Punjab then I shall certainly return to it to that very place. Meantime, Mother, consider what I have to eat. This is the true list. I eat daily sugar and ghi and flour, salt, meat, red peppers, some almonds and dates, sweets of various kinds as well as raisins and cardamoms. In the morning I eat tea and white biscuits. An hour after, halwa and puri [native dishes]. At noon, tea and bread; at seven o'clock of the evening, vegetable curry. At bedtime I drink milk. There is abundance of milk in this country. I am more comfortable here, I swear it to you, Mother, than any high officer in India. As for our clothing, there is no account kept of it. You would cry out, Mother, to see the <b>thick</b> <b>cloth</b> expended. So I beg you, Mother, to take comfort concerning your son. Do not tear my heart by telling me your years.

60|$|The general barking of {{the dogs}} had now ceased: {{sometimes}} one or another gave a suspicious yelping bark, but between these no sound whatever was audible.

The wearer highlights the 'kara' by carefully folding the end of the mundu. The kara generally appears on the right hand side of the person, though styles with the kara on the left side are prevalent.Unspoken rules of etiquette govern the way the mundu is worn. Men will often fold the garment in half to resemble a short skirt when working, cycling, etc., but it is considered disrespectful to speak to women or one's social superiors with the mundu folded up this way, revealing the legs from the knee down. When faced with such a social situation, the fold of the mundu is loosened with an imperceptible flick and it flutters down to cover the legs completely.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{studying}} vernacular Japanese architecture {{is to understand}} to what extent a house with large opening surfaces, no thermal insulation and very low environmental impact can become a valuable shelter during cold winters and hot humid summers. The reason of this result {{is to be found}} in the strict relationship between the socio-cultural context and the environmental characteristics of the building. The occupant’s behavior, the way of dressing, relaxing, living inside the house is a complement of the thermal, daylight and solar performances of the envelope. The comfort conditions are actively sought by the inhabitants and are guaranteed in winter by the use of <b>thick</b> <b>cloths</b> and small objects to heat locally the body. In summer the operation of large surface of paper panels and the connection with the outside nature trough the veranda, are an effective way to cope with the hot and humid climate.
