The {{engineer}} dispatched by the CIA to liaise with Castillo Armas informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. US President Harry S. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE. Castillo Armas's stories of his revolt and escape from prison proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras. Among these people, Castillo Armas claimed <b>to</b> <b>still</b> have support among the army, and began planning another revolt. His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.|$|E

5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known <b>to</b> <b>still</b> exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 20-yard line, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>Still</b> {{for a first}} down at the Tech 33-yard line.

Following the play, the Volunteers completed a penalty, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tennessee 22-yard line. Two short runs advanced the Hokies to the 19-yard line, then Druckenmiller completed a 10-yard pass to Freeman for a first down. On the next play, Druckenmiller connected with Still for a nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of reach for the Hokies.|$|E
