2500|$|The best {{alternative}} to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. [...] The quality of a BATNA {{has the potential to}} improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. One of the best strategy while going into a negotiation is <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have a strong BATNA, and if not, have tools equipped that can help you made the other side's BATNA weak. One of the major mistakes made by new negotiators is to disclose their BATNA at first without having had any discussion with the other side. This can jeopardise your position in the negotiation, as your negotiation might have been weaker than the other sides, and such disclosure puts you at a weaker spot in the negotiation. The best strategy is to {{ask a lot of questions}} to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E

40|$|The {{consideration}} of ethics in research, {{and in general}} business for thatmatter, is of growing importance. It is, therefore, critical <b>that</b> <b>you</b> understand the basics of ethical research and how this might affect your research project. This is especially important if your research involves inter-action with businesses or members of the general community who serve as participants (i. e., respondents) in your research. There are a range of inter-actions in your research that might occur, including in-depth interviews, focus groups, surveys, or even observing people’s behavior. Though all researchers (student, professional, or academic) are well inten-tioned, {{there is the possibility}} that interaction with participants may inadver-tently harm them in some unintended way. This could include • Psychological harm—for example, researching the use of nudity in advertising may show participants images that offend them. • Financial harm—researching unethical behavior within a given firm may provide management with information on individual employees that results in an individual getting fired, or undertaking industry-based research may inadvertently share sensitive information with a firm’s competitors, resulting in financial harm to the organization. • Social harm—researching how lifestyle affects consumption may unintentionally disclose a person’s sexual orientation when that person wanted to keep this confidential. It is your responsibility to consider whether any type of harm could occur when you plan your research and <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> mechanisms are instituted to remove it. It is, therefore, essential <b>that</b> <b>you</b> carefully evaluate the potential for harm <b>to</b> arise and <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> (a) behave according to appropriate ethical standards; (b) consider how your research might negatively affect partici-pants; and (c) protect yourself, your supervisors/teachers, and your institution from being placed in situations in which individuals could make claims of inap-propriate behavior, resulting in public criticism or even your being sued.

The actual choice is of course yours, but as any good student of social anthropology would tell you, what is the sensible strategy depends on the prevailing culture and social norms of the particular crossing. If you are in Italy, you should better step back and wait. If you are in Germany, you wouldn’t even have entered the road.

I’d better slow down – I don’t want to have to pay for that idiot”. Instead, if you are in the UK, establishing eye-contact is all you need to do: doing so, makes the driver think “that bloody pedestrian, he saw me but still wants to cross; I have to slow down”; failing to do so invites the driver to a challenge: “it is inappropriate to be crossing a road without checking the traffic first; I think I should accelerate, if anything, simply to make a point”...|$|R

In early RAID systems, the model of failure was quite simple: either the entire disk is working, or it fails completely, and the detection of such a failure is straightforward. This fail-stopmodel of disk failure makes building RAID relatively simple [S 90]. What you didn’t learn is about all of the other types of failure modes modern disks exhibit. Specifically, as Bairavasundaram et al. studied in great detail [B+ 07, B+ 08], modern disks will occasionally seem to be mostlyworking but have trouble successfully accessing one ormore blocks.
