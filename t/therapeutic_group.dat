40|$|Although the {{technological}} change in medicine {{has been widely}} recognized as the major driver of rising healthcare costs, {{there is very little}} research that directly estimates this effect. This paper uses both a single-equation and a simultaneous equations approach to empirically investigate the interactive relationship between technological innovation and the growth of health expenditure {{in the context of the}} pharmaceutical market in Taiwan. Based on observing 182 <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> between 1997 and 2006, we find evidence to support the argument that technological innovation and health expenditure are simultaneously determined as technological innovation and the growth of health expenditure are endogenous rather than exogenous. Specifically, we find that <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> associated with higher pharmaceutical expenditure are likely to attract more new products to the market. Meanwhile, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> with more new products are associated with higher pharmaceutical expenditures. An important implication of the paper is that the cost containment policy will not only affect the growth of health expenditure, but will also affect the progress of technological innovation in the health sector. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mandatory generic {{substitution}} {{was introduced}} in Sweden in October 2002 {{in order to try}} to curb escalating pharmaceutical expenditure. The aim of this study was to investigate how sales patterns for substitutable and non-substitutable pharmaceuticals have developed since the introduction of mandatory generic substitution; furthermore, to compare sales patterns in different groups of the population, based on patients' age and gender. Methods Five <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> comprising both substitutable and non-substitutable pharmaceuticals were included. The study period was from January 2000 to June 2005. National sales data were used, covering volumes of dispensed prescription medicines (expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants and day) of each pharmacological substance in the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> for each age and gender group. Sales patterns for substitutable and non-substitutable pharmaceuticals were compared using a descriptive approach. Results In most <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> there has been an increase in the volumes of substitutable pharmaceuticals sold since the introduction of the reform, ranging from one third to three times the initial volume; whereas the volumes of non-substitutable pharmaceuticals have levelled out or declined. There were few gender differences in sales patterns of substitutable and non-substitutable drugs. In three <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups,</b> sales patterns differed across different age groups, and there was a tendency for volumes of recently introduced non-substitutable pharmaceuticals to be proportionally higher in the youngest age groups. Conclusion Since the introduction of the reform, there has been a proportionally larger increase in sales of substitutable pharmaceuticals compared with sales of non-substitutable pharmaceuticals. This indicates that the reform might have contributed to larger sales of less expensive pharmaceuticals. </p...|$|R

50|$|On 1 February 1998, another {{effort to}} limit {{the cost of the}} PBS {{involved}} the introduction of <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Group</b> Premiums (TGPs) on medications that are priced significantly above the cheapest medication in a defined therapeutic sub-group where the drugs are considered to be of similar safety and efficacy. The TGP is the price difference between the premium brand and the benchmark (base) price for drugs in the class. The patient must pay this TGP in addition to the normal patient co-payment contribution if they have been prescribed such a medication. The TGP paid does not count toward the Safety Net threshold.|$|E

Participants were tested using a Mini Mental State Examination to test their level of cognitive ability and see if they qualified as a demented patient {{to be included in the}} study. The participants had to have no other health problems allowing for the experiment to have accurate internal validity. The results clearly showed that those who were given the Cognitive Stimulation Therapy did significantly better on all memory tasks than those that did not receive the therapy. Out of the eleven memory tasks that were given ten of the memory tasks were improved by the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>group.</b> This is another study that supports the efficacy of CST, demonstrating that the elderly that have dementia greatly benefit from this treatment..

50|$|Adventure {{therapy has}} {{normalizing}} effects on deficits in delinquent adolescent's developmental process, {{as a process}} of moving into formal operational thinking which is achieved through the experiential learning theories. A therapist holds the skills to make the adventure experience a therapy. The theoretical basis of adventure therapy describes the participant as a learning being who achieves their greatest learning outside the classroom, through challenge and perceived risk, promoting social skills through experiencing a group challenge mixed with affect, cognition, psychomotor activity and formal operational thinking generated through metaphor. Experiential learning becomes adventure therapy when the activities are planned and implemented as vehicles for patients to address individual treatment goals. Adventure experiences molded into a more <b>therapeutic</b> <b>group</b> model ran by the therapist can have a more significant effect than the one-day intervention run by counselors. It is important to have the clinician {{as an integral part of}} the adventure therapy process so that there can be a strong transference of the adventure experience to other aspects of the therapeutic process.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{analyze the}} pattern of adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) of oseltamivir and its comparison with available data. Materials and Methods: Suspected or confirmed cases of H 1 N 1 influenza A on therapeutic regimen and close contacts of cases H 1 N 1 influenza A on prophylactic regimen of oseltamivir were included. Data were collected by personal interview after obtaining written informed consent. Causality, severity, and preventability assessments were done by using Naranjo′s scale, modified Hartwig and Siegel′s scale, and modified Schumock and Thornton Scale, respectively. Data were expressed in proportions. Frequency of ADRs in therapeutic and prophylactic groups were compared with phase III trial of oseltamivir by using Chi-square test. Results: Total 294 patients were interviewed. In prophylactic group, 107 of 257 (41. 63 %) and in <b>therapeutic,</b> <b>group</b> 23 of 37 (62. 16 %) developed ADRs. ADRs reported in <b>therapeutic</b> <b>group</b> was significantly (P = 0. 029) higher as compared with prophylactic group.

40|$|EVER since co-therapy was introduced, the {{advantages}} and disadvantages of this method have been debated. Napolitani (1979, 1980) sums up the situa-tion as follows: As far as group therapy conduct is concerned, co-therapy not only fails to offer significant advantages, but is in fact not quite free of a certain amount of risk (the frequency of interpersonal complications between therapists is well known). However, there are two situations in group therapy work in which co-therapy may be indicated: (1) in handling large groups, and (2) in dealing with special <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups,</b> such as groups of psychotic patients, delinquents, married couples, and so on. The same rule applies when <b>therapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> are designed to ensure the practical implementation of a research or education programme.

One of the immediate reactions to the relation of unanimity between the co-therapists is envy. Skynner (1974) notes the importance o...|$|R

Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy of prophylactic versus therapeutic phototherapy in VLBW infants. Patients and Methods Fifty VLBW infants were randomly assigned to receive either phototherapy from the first day of life regardless of their serum bilirubin level for up to five days (prophylactic group) or phototherapy when their bilirubin level reached half the exchange transfusion level (<b>therapeutic</b> <b>group).</b> All data, including gestational age, gender, birth weight, serum bilirubin level on the first day, peak serum bilirubin concentration, the age at which the peak serum bilirubin level was reached, duration of phototherapy, and the number of exchange transfusions, were studied and analyzed. Results The mean bilirubin level on the first day in both groups exhibited no significant difference. The peak serum bilirubin was 7. 7 ± 1. 4 and 8. 5 ± 2. 1 mg/dL in the prophylactic and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>group,</b> respectively, and there was no significant difference in the age at which the peak serum bilirubin levels were reached in both groups (2. 4 ± 1. 2 vs. 2. 1 ± 1 days in the prophylactic and the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>group,</b> respectively). The mean duration of phototherapy in the prophylactic group was 84 ± 43 hours, while for the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>group</b> it was 72 ± 39 hours, and hence the difference was not significant.
