50|$|Later {{political}} developments in Karain {{have not been}} portrayed in the published fiction on Islandia. Presumably after World War I the German controlled regions would have been assigned to other nations as <b>trustee</b> <b>territories.</b> The last glimpse of Karain is from 1969, at which time Islandia is contemplating joining the United Nations; no information {{about the status of}} other countries in Karain at that time is provided.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of many {{communities in the}} state {{can be traced to}} the colonial era when the Germans ruled a swath of territory known as the Northern and Southern Kameruns from Dikwa in the North to Victoria (Limbe) on the Atlantic coast in the 19th century. These were however handed over, as UN <b>Trustee</b> <b>Territories,</b> to the British at the end of the first World War with the signing of the Versailles Treaty. After a series of plebiscites, the Northern Kameruns joined Nigeria to form the then Sardauna Province, and the Southern Kameruns formed a Confederation with French speaking Cameroon.|$|R

50|$|German {{presence}} in Africa posed no {{direct threat to}} the Belgian Congo; however, in 1914 a German gunboat sank a number of Belgian vessels on Lake Tanganyika. Congolese forces, under Belgian officers, fought German colonial forces in the Cameroons and seized control of the western third of German East Africa, advancing {{as far as the}} town at Tabora. The League of Nations in 1925 made Belgium the <b>trustee</b> of this <b>territory</b> (modern Rwanda and Burundi) as the mandate of Ruanda-Urundi.|$|R
2500|$|City {{officials}} of Tallahassee, however, {{took steps to}} establish a school for boys as early as 1827 {{with the establishment of}} the Leon Academy. [...] The Leon Academy was advertised in the Pensacola Gazette of March 9, 1827 as being under the supervision of Presbyterian Rev. Henry M. White, A.M. [...] By early 1831 the Leon Academy was {{under the control of the}} Tallahassee City Council. [...] The Leon Academy was incorporated by an act of the Territorial Legislative Council on February 12, 1831 under the control of seven trustees. [...] The Leon Academy suffered from lack of financial resources as well as high administrative turnover and in September 1836 was operated by John M. Brook of Virginia as a [...] "private Seminary for boys", while the trustees continued to control and manage the property. [...] By 1840 the Leon Academy ceased operations as a public school. [...] The trustees, however, turned to the Territorial Legislature once again, who passed an [...] "Act in Relation to the Trustees of Leon Academy" [...] in 1840 wherein the Treasurer of the Territory was directed to pay funds to the trustees to [...] "assist said Trustees in building an Academy". [...] On March 9, 1840 the Leon Academy had been refreshed with some Territory support. [...] The <b>trustees</b> solicited <b>Territory</b> support on the basis the Leon Academy would serve both male and female students. [...] There is disagreement among scholars if the male-only Leon Academy is the forerunner of the West Florida Seminary. [...] A point of agreement between the scholars is that the same leading citizens of Tallahassee were interested in both institutions.|$|R
50|$|After {{his return}} from the war, Renfrow removed from North Carolina to the {{vicinity}} of Russellville, Arkansas where in 1865 he married Jennie B. York of Judsonia, Arkansas on October 17, 1875. He functioned as a deputy county official at Russellville in the 1880s. Upon the opening of Oklahoma for settlement in 1889, he located at Norman, Oklahoma where he was engaged in the banking business in association with T. M. Richardson of Oklahoma City. President Grover Cleveland appointed Renfrow as governor of Oklahoma Territory and on May 7, 1893 {{the oath of office}} was administered to him at Guthrie. He was a democrat, being the only governor from that party during the territorial days. The outstanding event of his administration was the opening of the Cherokee Outlet on September 16, 1893. It was during his tenure that the Oklahoma Historical Society was formed and on February 21, 1895, Renfrow approved an act constituting that society as <b>trustee</b> for Oklahoma <b>Territory.</b> He was succeeded by Cassius M. Barnes who entered office on May 24, 1897.|$|R
