5|$|The woman's {{arms were}} {{swinging}} by her side, untied, while about <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> swung {{the boy with}} his clothes partly torn off and his hands tided with a saddle string. The only marks on either body were that made by the ropes upon the necks. Gently swaying in the wind, the ghastly spectacle was discovered this morning by a negro boy taking his cow to water. Hundreds of people from Okemah and {{the western part of}} the county went to view the scene.|$|E
2500|$|... "One {{night the}} Piegans came and killed {{one of our}} people. [...] We trailed them in the snow all night. [...] At dawn we came up to them. [...] One Piegan stopped. [...] We {{surrounded}} the one. [...] He was a brave man. [...] I started for him. [...] He raised his gun to shoot when I was <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> [...] I {{dropped to the ground}} and his bullet went over me; then I jumped on him and cut him through below the ribs and scalped him. [...] We tied the scalp to a long pole. [...] The women blackened their faces and we had a big dance over it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> a stout, {{elderly woman}} {{interrupted}} the girl's persuasions. The elderly woman's back was turned, and the back-loose, bulging, and misshapen--began a convulsive heaving.|$|E
60|$|Looking about scrutinizingly, {{as those}} {{born and bred}} on the {{frontier}} learn to do early in life, Dick saw his father's rifle <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> or more <b>away,</b> and between it and him a trail of blood through the sage-brush, then a sinister, crimson blotch on the sand.|$|R
60|$|They {{had reached}} a point where the {{outcropping}} of rocks had split in twain, forming the ledge they were on and another ledge <b>twenty</b> or thirty <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> Between the two ledges was a hollow with jagged rocks far below. The other ledge wound around another hill, leading to the northwest.|$|R
60|$|When he was <b>twenty</b> {{or thirty}} <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> I started after him. As I did so, I noticed {{he had left}} a large note-book lying on the ground. I took it up, and hurried on. For a moment more we were safe upon the street again, and the two toughs slunk away up the alley.|$|R
60|$|This accomplished, Dick led {{the horse}} {{up to the}} back of the stable and unhitched him. He could hear George Strong and the utility man talking less than <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Here she {{interrupted}} to {{say that}} she knew three of the names I had mentioned. Then, pointing to a small, upright gravestone about <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> she added, [...] "And there's one." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{years he}} remembered the scene. The vineyard, the yellow stubble; and the river rushing on and on with {{tranquil}} power, and the slow panting of the steamboat. A doe {{ran out of the}} forest, and paused, her head raised, not <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|If Dan {{had been}} acting {{the part of}} {{sentinel}} just inside the shed door {{an hour after the}} two retired, he would have seen in the gloom three dark forms emerge from behind a pile of boards which he had failed to look over carefully, and advance cautiously toward the shed door, halting when they were <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> or more <b>away.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Samoa and American Samoa have local Red Cross offices. New Zealand Red Cross {{humanitarian}} aid workers {{are also on}} stand-by to travel to Samoa, and has started a fund for donations. [...] The Red Cross is building 76 ten <b>foot</b> by <b>twenty</b> <b>foot</b> single room homes and 23 <b>twenty</b> <b>foot</b> by <b>twenty</b> <b>foot</b> multi room homes in Nuiatoputapu to replace homes destroyed there by the tsunami.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously {{he lowered}} himself {{over the edge}} of the cliff, and with utter {{noiselessness}} commenced the descent toward the bottom of the gulch. He stopped often and turned his keen eyes and ears in the direction of the cave's mouth at the far end of the gulch, some hundred <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> As he neared the foot of the cliff his danger increased greatly. If he could reach the bottom and cover half the distance to the tree that stood in the center of the gulch he would feel comparatively safe for then, even if Numa appeared, he felt that he could beat him either to the cliff or to the tree, but to scale the first thirty feet of the cliff rapidly enough to elude the leaping beast would require a running start of at least <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> as there were no very good hand- or footholds close to the bottom--he had had to run up the first <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> like a squirrel running up a tree that other time he had beaten an infuriated Numa to it. He had no desire to attempt it again unless the conditions were equally favorable at least, for he had escaped Numa's raking talons by only a matter of inches on the former occasion.|$|R
60|$|From {{the front}} end of the wagon Dick Arbuckle shifted back to the rear. Here the same dreary outlook of storm, mud and {{flapping}} canvases presented itself. Not so much as a stray dog was in sight, and the nearest wagon was <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|We saw {{directly}} in front of General St. Leger's camp a dozen or more Indians broaching a cask of rum, and hardly more than <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> were a lot of Tories, drinking from bottles which had evidently been plundered from the commander's private store.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted his}} hat gravely, shoved off the boat, leaped into it, {{and before she}} could hold out her hand was <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> She turned and ran quickly up the rocks. When she reached the hotel, {{she could see the}} boat already half across the bay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Duelling {{is a good}} custom!" [...] said Sarelli. [...] "I {{shall have}} the honour to teach you just this one, unless you are afraid. Here are pistols--this room is <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> across at least, <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> is no bad distance." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{walked to}} the door {{at the far end of}} the {{apartment}} and cautiously opened it an inch. Before him and about two <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> was the blank wall of another building. Bradley opened the door a little farther and looked in both directions. There was no one in sight to the left over a considerable expanse of roof-top, and to the right another building shut off his line of vision at about <b>twenty</b> <b>feet.</b> Slipping out, he turned to the right and in a few steps found a narrow passageway between two buildings. Turning into this he passed about half its length when he saw a Wieroo appear at the opposite end and halt. The creature was not looking down the passageway; but at any moment it might turn its eyes toward him, when he would be immediately discovered.|$|R
50|$|He {{then ran}} <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> to the left.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} pattering of little sliding rocks below; {{stealthy}} padded footsteps and hard panting breaths, almost like coughs; then the lion {{passed out of}} the slide not <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> He saw us, and sprang into the pinyon scrub with the leap of a scared deer.|$|E
60|$|Teddy was on {{the point}} of protesting against such {{excessive}} precaution when the sound of voices caused all the party to crouch low among the bushes, hiding themselves in the foliage just as four Chan Santa Cruz Indians came to a halt not more than <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|At last Hortensius Martius {{had reached}} {{the foot of the}} steps. The massive iron gates stood alone between him and the black panther, which cowered some <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> behind a low monticule covered with tufts of grass, its tiny eyes of topaz fixed upon the {{oncoming}} prey.|$|E

60|$|Tambi obeyed, {{exposing the}} lantern <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from where his captain stood. This gave Van Horn the {{advantage}} over the approaching canoe-men, for the lantern, suspended through the barbed wire across the rail and well down, would clearly illuminate the occupants of the canoe while he was left in semi-darkness and shadow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait {{until we}} get {{on the road with}} the sledges," [...] {{answered}} Barwell Dawson. [...] "Then you'll see some fancy doings with the whips. Some of those chaps can reach a dog <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> and take a nip out of his hide as quick as a wink. That's the way they get the dogs under such perfect control." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{turned away}} and started to walk firmly down the deck. <b>Twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> she swayed and thrust a hand against the wall to save herself. And so she went on, {{supporting}} herself against the cabins and walking very slowly." [...] Treloar ceased. He {{turned his head and}} favored the little man with a look of cold inquiry.|$|E
60|$|Some time in past ages an {{earthquake}} had produced a fault at this point, so that beyond {{the spot where}} I stood the strata had slipped down a matter of <b>twenty</b> <b>feet.</b> The result was that the continuation of my ledge lay <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> below me, where it ended as abruptly as did the end upon which I stood.|$|R
60|$|The {{outer circuit}} was covered, as a lean-to, all round his inner, apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty two angles {{to the top}} posts of the inner house, being about <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> distant; {{so that there was}} a space like a walk within the outer wicker wall, and without the inner, near <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> wide.|$|R

60|$|I {{kept the}} canoe headed in, {{and we were}} not long coming to shallow water. Here the {{bonefish}} made a final dash for freedom, but it was short and feeble, compared with his first runs. He got about <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> then sheered, showing his broad, silver side. R. C. wound him in close, and an instant later {{the bow of the}} canoe grated on shore.|$|E
60|$|Sue looked solicitously out the window. What {{was there}} to count? There was only a bare, dreary yard to be seen, and the blank side of the brick house <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> An old, old ivy vine, gnarled and decayed at the roots, climbed half way up the brick wall. The cold breath of autumn had {{stricken}} its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung, almost bare, to the crumbling bricks.|$|E
60|$|Even in the {{daylight}} he did not dare leave the fire to chop fresh wood. <b>Twenty</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> towered a huge dead spruce. He spent half the day extending his campfire to the tree, at any moment a half dozen burning faggots ready at hand to fling at his enemies. Once at the tree, he studied the surrounding forest in order to fell the tree {{in the direction of}} the most firewood.|$|E
