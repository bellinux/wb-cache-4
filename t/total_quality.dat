Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and industrial designer Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on ergonomics, functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, <b>Total</b> <b>quality</b> management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E

The aim of the current study is to investigate the structural relationships among electronic service <b>quality,</b> <b>total</b> service <b>quality</b> and <b>total</b> satisfaction by testing a structural model. The current study utilized a survey design. The data was collected from 223 participants in Turkey using a structured questionnaire which was derived from literature.

40|$|ON THE PRICING EFFECT OF EARNINGS QUALITY PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the interplay between {{earnings}} quality, information risk and cost of equity capital. <b>Total</b> accruals <b>quality</b> metric which is a numerical estimation based on a firm’s residual accruals is used to depict earnings quality in this thesis. <b>Total</b> accruals <b>quality</b> is further decomposed into innate accruals quality and discretionary accruals quality in order to examine their pricing implications separately. The thesis contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether firm-specific information risk is a priced risk factor, and what is the mechanism through which information risk affects expected returns. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The thesis employs an extensive sample of data drawn from the US market in 1970 – 2006. The earnings quality proxies used in the study rely solely on accounting data, which are retrieved from Compustat North America Annual file. These proxies are used to construct factor mimicking portfolios, whose returns represent the exposure to that particular risk factor. The monthly firm returns data are retrieved from CRSP Monthly Stock file and the other return items are retrieved from Wharton Research Data Services (wrds). Asset-pricing methodology is then applied to study the effect of <b>total</b> accruals <b>quality,</b> innate accruals quality and discretionary accruals quality on expected returns. RESULTS The results provide consistent evidence that <b>total</b> accruals <b>quality</b> is a priced risk factor. The main results from two-stage cross-sectional regressions do not have implications as regards the magnitude of the accruals quality risk premium, but the average positive coefficients indicate that poor accruals quality increase expected returns. The results for innate accruals quality are similar to that of <b>total</b> accruals <b>quality,</b> except that the risk premium implied by the average positive coefficient estimates appears actually larger. This suggests that the pricing effect of <b>total</b> accruals <b>quality</b> may be attributable to the innate components of accruals quality. The results on discretionary accruals quality are somewhat mixed, and the hypothesis that discretionary accruals are just noise in earnings cannot be rejected.

Parents/caregivers of 3. 5 to 5. 5 year-olds (n = 4968) recruited through kindergartens in six European countries within the ToyBox-study completed questionnaires on socio-demographics and a food frequency questionnaire on their preschoolers' diet. To assess intervention effects and differences by SES, multilevel repeated measures analyses were conducted. In contrast to no significant difference in <b>total</b> diet <b>quality,</b> in both the intervention and control group, the dietary quality and dietary equilibrium increased, with a larger increase in the intervention group (mean difference (quality) : + 3. 4 %; mean difference (equilibrium) : + 0. 9 %) compared to the control group ((quality) : + 1. 5 %; (equilibrium) : + 0. 2 %). SES was not a significant moderator for intervention effects on <b>total</b> diet <b>quality,</b> nor for the four subcomponents.

25|$|The term of post bureaucratic {{is used in}} two senses in the {{organizational}} literature: one generic and one much more specific. In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic is often used to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber's ideal type bureaucracy. This may include <b>total</b> <b>quality</b> management, culture management and matrix management, amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber's rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies, rather than a fundamental shift away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at 'Tech' argued that 'the essence of bureaucratic control - the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations - does not change in principle.....it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization's culture'.|$|E
