50|$|<b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> emotion or argumentum ad passiones is {{a logical}} fallacy {{characterized}} by the manipulation of the recipient's emotions {{in order to win}} an argument, especially in the absence of factual evidence. This kind of <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> emotion is a type of red herring and encompasses several logical fallacies, including <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> consequences, <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear, <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> flattery, <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> pity, <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> ridicule, <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> spite, and wishful thinking.|$|R

[...] However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially George Bealer have tried <b>to</b> defend <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> intuition against Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis. A different challenge <b>to</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> intuition has recently come from experimental philosophers, who argue that <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.|$|R
