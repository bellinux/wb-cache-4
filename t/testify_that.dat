5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2015, {{following}} earlier postponements, an Article 32 hearing (similar to {{a preliminary}} hearing in the civilian system) was held at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

25|$|The Acts of the Apostles {{describes}} the disciple Stephen being seized and {{brought before the}} Sanhedrin. Those who opposed Stephen persuaded false witnesses to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> Stephen was guilty of blasphemy against Moses and against God. Stephen used the occasion of his trial to remind the Sanhedrin of the Old Testament testimony of rebellion, idolatry, and persecution of the prophets that culminated {{in the murder of}} Jesus. The crowd was so angry that Stephen was stoned to death.|$|E
25|$|Queensberry's {{attorney}} {{announced in}} court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, which left him bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|Fozheng {{continued}} the male {{line of the}} Luo family. His grandson Wenju is mentioned in the imprint of the 1615 edition of the Wubuliuce, printed in Nanjing.

25|$|The Crown's case relied only on eyewitnesses {{who were}} near Pentridge Prison when Hodson {{was shot and}} killed, {{because there was no}} {{scientific}} forensic evidence to prove Ryan fired a shot. Each eyewitness testified a different account of what they saw and where Ryan was standing. Eleven eyewitnesses <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> they saw Ryan waving and aiming his rifle. There were variations, whether Ryan was standing, walking or squatting at the time a single shot was heard and whether Ryan was to the left or right of Hodson. Only four eyewitnesses <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> they saw Ryan fire a shot. Two eyewitnesses <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> they saw smoke coming from Ryan's rifle. Two eyewitnesses <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> they saw Ryan recoil his rifle.|$|R

Gilani would later <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> he discussed his views regarding Kashmir—the focus of LeT's militant activities —with his DEA handlers. The DEA has insisted that it was unaware of Gilani's political and religious radicalization.|$|E
25|$|Is it {{necessary}} for sisters to be set apart to officiate in the sacred ordinances of washing, anointing, and laying on of hands in administering to the sick? It certainly is not. Any and all sisters who honor their holy endowments, not only have right, but should feel it a duty, whenever called upon to administer to our sisters in these ordinances, which God has graciously committed to His daughters {{as well as to}} His sons; and we <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> when administered and received in faith and humility they are accompanied with almighty power.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, we {{are forced}} to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> Bourguiba's Tunisia could no more be called secular than Ben Ali's or the rest of the Arab Muslim states, for more than a {{neutrality}} of orientation and the religious freedom of the state, secularism implies the autonomy of public and religious institutions. The reality is that the institutional presence of Islam in Tunisia, although strictly circumscribed, is truly a constant reference, implicit or explicit, legitimizing the regime's direction. Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so long as it does not threaten public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E
25|$|Mollath's former lawyer <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he {{had been}} {{threatened}} by Mollath.

50|$|However, {{during the}} trial Dylan's nanny, Kristie Goteke, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> {{for a period of}} 15-20 minutes she did not know where Allen and Dylan were. The children's French tutor, Sophie Berge, also <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> she later noticed that Dylan was not wearing any underwear.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the state {{legislature}} passed laws making manumission more difficult. The manumission law of 1820 required slaveholders to gain legislative approval for each act of manumission and generally required other free adults to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> the person to be freed could support himself. This meant that free people of color were thwarted from freeing their children if born into slavery. So, while some slaves were freed during this period and might earn enough to purchase relatives, they could not readily free them. The first law required that five citizens attest {{to the ability of}} the person proposed to be freed to earn a living; this prevented slaveholders from freeing their own children before they became adults. In 1820, the legislature ended personal manumissions, requiring all slaveholders to gain individual permission from the legislature before manumitting even family members.|$|E
25|$|Several months {{pass with}} Carlisle {{monitoring}} Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter Irina sees Renesmee {{from a distance}} and believes her to be an immortal child. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and {{because they could not}} be trained nor restrained, they destroyed entire villages. They were eventually executed, as were the parents who created them, and the creation of such children outlawed. Irina goes to the Volturi to report what she has seen. Alice sees the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> Renesmee is not an immortal. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denali, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield which had protected her from Edward's mind reading even when she was human, and which she can now extend to protect others from attacks.|$|E
25|$|Both North West and Hudson’s Bay {{companies}} formally {{protested the}} proclamation, but Lord Selkirk, being the majority shareholder of the HBC {{was able to}} deal with his company’s complaints through official channels. Special Commissioner Coltman, the government official later charged with investigating the Battle of Seven Oaks, suggested that Gov. Macdonell waited for an opportune moment to release his proclamation, the idea of which he had brought up some time earlier, and suggested that moment was the American victory at the Battle of Lake Erie which occurred September 10, 1813 which gave the Americans command of Lake Erie and threatened the NWC’s ability to transport goods, furs and provisions over the Great Lakes. Issuing the proclamation at this time therefore would have starved the Nor’westers out of the region. In fact, the Nor’Westers would later <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> the British loss of Lake Erie rendered the company more dependent on the Red River pemmican than ever. The NWC disregarded the proclamation and Gov. Macdonell was obliged to enforce it.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, a {{jury found}} him 40% {{liable for the}} {{accident}} (Fabian <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Simpson repeatedly urged him to drive faster while Simpson <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Fabian suddenly accelerated wildly {{in spite of his}} orders to slow down). He received $32,000 in an out-of-court settlement.|$|R
50|$|The {{train driver}} <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> his {{interpretation}} of the driving info and the actual signalling suggested a maximum permitted speed of 120 km/h. One of the construction planning coordinators <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he did mention a possible misinterpretation in a meeting allowing for a potential danger.|$|R
2500|$|Burtram <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> she {{may have}} {{inadvertently}} informed her father about her mother's boyfriend shortly before her death. [...] When questioned by the defense counsel, she supported the argument for voluntary manslaughter, <b>testifying</b> <b>that</b> {{she had never seen}} her father act violently or aggressively toward her mother.|$|R
