40|$|Cotton is not {{the answer}} to meet the rapidly growing demand for textile fibers. Wood-based {{regenerated}} cellulosefibers are an attractive alternative. Since wood is a candidate to replace fossil raw materials in so many applications of thecircular economy, other sources need investigation. Cotton linters work in the viscose process – can cotton waste beused to make dissolving pulp? We describe the textile qualities of lyocell fibers from (i) pure cotton waste pulp and(ii) blending with conventional dissolving pulp. The staple fibers were tensile tested, yarns spun and tensile tested andknitted, and tested for shrinkage, water and dye sorption, abrasion resistance, fuzzing and pilling, staining and fastness. TENCEL staple fibers and off-the-shelf TENCEL yarn were used as references. The results show that the two studyfibers had tenacity and an E-modulus that exceeded the staple fiber reference. Also, the study yarns were at least as goodas the spun reference yarn and the commercial off-the-shelf yarn in terms of wet tenacity. Single jerseys made from thestudy yarns shrunk less upon laundering, which is surprising since they could absorb at least as much water at acomparable rate as the references. Dyeability, staining and color fastness, durability and pilling tendency showed thatthe two study fiber <b>tricots</b> performed at least as good as the references. This study suggests that cotton waste is apromising candidate for special grade pulp to suit niche regenerated fiber products or to spice up conventional woodbaseddissolving pulp...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} the colour of football outfits on localising football players and on the results of football matches. Two studies were conducted: an experimental study examining the effects of outfit colour on the assessment of the positions of computer-animated football players in a video set-up (study 1) and a retrospective study on professional football clubs' performances dependent on their outfit colours (study 2). The studies were conducted with 18 human volunteers aged 15 - 18 years (study 1) and league results from 10 professional European football teams over 17 years (1995 - 2013) (study 2). We analysed the number of correct assessments of the positions of virtual football players with different outfit colours (study 1) and analysed the relationship between match results and outfits' colours (study 2). Study 1 showed that the position of players wearing white outfits was better assessed in 5. 2 % of the trials compared to players wearing green outfits (P = 0. 007). Study 2 showed that Manchester City conceded less goals against in away games in highly visible kits (r = 0. 62; P = 0. 024), while Newcastle United conceded less goals and won more points while playing in kits associated with low visibility (r = 0. 63; P = 0. 007; r = 0. 50; P = 0. 040, respectively). We conclude that the colour of football outfits affects evaluations of football players' positions on the field, with white <b>tricots</b> resulting in the best location assessment. The outfit colour may indirectly influence football match results, warranting more attention to the home and away shirts by team managers and football scientists...|$|R
25|$|The Glacier de Miage – {{not to be}} {{confused}} with the much larger Glacier du Miage on the Italian side (see above) – forms from snows collecting between the Aiguille de <b>Tricot</b> and the south-western face of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The glacier descends in a south-westerly direction for approximately 2.5km.|$|E
25|$|The First Ascent of the Aiguille de Bionnassay was {{undertaken}} on 28 July 1865 by Florence Crauford Grove, Edward N. Buxton and Reginald S. McDonald, with guides Jean Pierre Cachat and Michel Payot. They ascended the north-west face {{to reach the}} ridge above the Aiguille de <b>Tricot,</b> from where they continued to the knife-edged summit ridge, arriving in a thunderstorm. A detailed account is given below.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 80´s Kjell Eng, {{the founder of}} Engtex, got the idea to use {{textiles}} for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was very aware of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed <b>tricot</b> fabric that peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging. However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} there are {{represented}} some indices {{of the changes}} of the living standard of people, who live {{as well in the}} town as in the country. The basical indices were worked out mainly in reference to the years 1950 - 1967, only in some cases there were shown the general tendencies {{that took place in the}} scope of income and consumption in the last 50 years. A steady base of the growth of income of people as well direct as indirect Was the increase of the national income that in the course of the last 50 years multiplied 37 times. In the consequence the real income of workers, who worked in the industry and building increased 5 times per 1 worker and the real income of people increased above 9 times. The growth of real people's income was done mainly in 3 ways, namely as the result of the successive reduction of pricess for some goods of common comsumption, by the increase of workers wages and the steady enlarging of the social services from the social funds of consumption. In the result of the increase of real income there was changed not only the amount of consumption but also the structure of the consumption of the Soviet people. In the scope of consumption of food there increased especially the consumption of meat, fish, fish products, milk, diary products, eggs and vegetables. The tendency of improving the quality of the eaten products was very distinct especially in the last 17 years. In the examined period of time (1950 - 1967) there increased many times shopping of the articles of culture-existential goods. A big dynamics was shown in buying television sets, radio sets, furniture, bicycles, motorcycles, scooters, refrigerators, electric cleaners, polish machines, sewing machines, and all kinds of <b>tricots,</b> clothes and shoes., A big influence on the improving of living conditions and on the structure of people's expenses had in the last years an immense development of the residential building. In the result of big progress in the residential building in the last 12 years almost 160 millions of Soviet citizens improved their living conditions. The people of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics increased their savings with every year. In 1967 the whole amount of the reached 27 milliards roubles. These savings have been saved mainly for buying private cars and furnitureDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R

2500|$|There are {{two major}} {{varieties}} of knitting: weft knitting and warp knitting. In the more common weft knitting, the wales are perpendicular to {{the course of the}} yarn. [...] In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel. [...] In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding stitches to each wale in turn, moving across the fabric as in a raster scan. [...] By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale. [...] Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine. [...] Warp-knitted fabrics such as <b>tricot</b> and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.|$|E

2500|$|Comme des Garçons's {{designer}} fashion {{lines are}} designed and produced in Japan. Lines including Comme des Garçons Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons Noir, Comme des Garçons Homme, Comme des Garçons Plus, Comme des Garçons Man, Comme des Garçons Deux and Comme des Garçons Shirt, are all handmade. This is because Comme des Garçons adamantly values {{the quality of}} hand-made garments, reflected in the more expensive price and longevity of their products. Play, the company's luxury casual streetwear line, is mainly produced in Japan, Spain, and Turkey, with France's Play factory still utilizing many hand-made procedures as opposed to Japan, Spain, and Turkey's production line factory. This is because France's factory also produces hand-made only lines, including <b>Tricot</b> Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons Homme Plus Evergreen, and Junya Watanabe Comme Des Garçons. It is believed that all fabrics are produced in Japan, but some China and Australia sold pieces are hand-finished in France for quality control purposes (distinguishable by the hand stitched heart emblem).

2500|$|A third helper, a porter, {{had joined}} the two guides, solely to lead the party of five mountaineers down onto the Glacier de Bionnassay in darkness, {{well away from the}} normal route taken by others to reach the Aiguilles de Gouter. This task the porter utterly failed to do, and it was left to Cachat, the guide, to find a {{suitable}} track onto the ice in total darkness. Sunrise found them {{at the edge of the}} glacier, and their useless porter soon departed. Crossing the glacier, they climbed a prominent rock ridge to gain a better view and to ascertain their best route. At first they stared hopelessly at the glaciated slopes towering above them, realising a direct ascent to the summit was impossible. Grove later described it thus: [...] "The ice in all its gaunt blue nakedness [...] raked by showers of grape from overhanging rock". Eventually they determined a sinuous route up through the billowing ice fields and avalanche debris to reach the crest of the ridge running from the Aiguille de <b>Tricot</b> to the summit of their mountain. Cachat led the way, hacking innumerable footholds in the steep ice until, some five hours after leaving the rock promontory, they finally attained the ridge, and found the day well-advanced and the weather deteriorating. Here they rested a while before continuing along the crest with a sheer ice slope dropping to one side and treacherous rocks on the other. By now the weather had changed and a heavy snowfall had begun. The ridge had become more exposed and a strong wind had developed. As each step was cut in the ice, their axes buzzed in the electrically charged air and they were forced to straddle the exposed, razor-sharp ridge as it was now completely impossible to stand. Grove later wrote that their [...] "steel axe-heads gave out something musical in tone, but nevertheless evil to hear, for it told us we were now in the very heart of the thunderstorm".|$|E
60|$|A curious {{piece of}} {{traditional}} folklore came out, {{but only as}} hearsay, in court. M. Cheval, Maire of Cideville, deposed that a M. Savoye told him that Thorel had once been shepherd to a M. <b>Tricot.</b> At that time Thorel said {{to one of two}} persons in his company: 'Every time I strike my cabin (a shelter on wheels used by shepherds) you will fall,' and, at each stroke, the victim felt something seize his throat, and fell! {279b} This anecdote is curious, because in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research is a long paper by Dr. Gibotteau, on his experiments with a hospital nurse called Berthe. This woman, according to the doctor, had the power of making him see hallucinations, of a nature more or less horrible, from a distance. She had been taught some traditional feats of rural sorcery, among others that of making a man stumble, or fall, as he walked. The doctor does not make any allusion to the Cideville affair, and it seems probable that this trick is part of the peasant's magical repertoire, or, rather, that the peasant warlocks boast of being able to perform the trick. But, if we can accept the physician's evidence, as 'true for him,' at least, then a person like Berthe really might affect, from a distance, a boy like Lemonier with a haunting hallucination. To do this is witchcraft, and for crimes of this kind, or on false charges of this kind, poor Mrs. Bishop was burned at Salem in 1692.|$|E
