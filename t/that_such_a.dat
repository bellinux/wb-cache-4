5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} from 25 March contains her {{note that}} joining the uprising was her sole idea, {{and that she}} had hoped <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> moment would come her entire life. She cut her hair, prepared a uniform for herself and organized and equipped a group of volunteers, speaking passionately after a mass on 29 March. On 4 April she signed a declaratory document marking her access to the local uprising forces. Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry, 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with war scythes.|$|E

5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in stereo, and BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Wallingford, King Edgar {{made this}} {{division}} during a council at York, {{in order to}} prevent the whole area becoming the inheritance of one man. The Historia Regum claims <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> division took place not in Oslac's time but Osulf's, and that the division line was the River Tyne rather than Tees; historian Dorothy Whitelock considered this to be apocryphal.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E
5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E

5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E
5|$|After {{a week of}} shooting, {{the film}} was shelved due to the view <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> story might not succeed in Telugu; the {{production}} company instead produced Shanti, which became a failure. D.L. Narayana then decided to revive Devadasu as an independent producer. Janaki, who was originally chosen for the character of Parvati, was replaced by Savitri.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Selena's {{full-length}} Spanish albums Selena (1989) and Ven Conmigo (1990), which included Tejano and other Mexican pop styles, she decided that her next recording would feature an English-language song. She believed <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> song would convince EMI Records' chairman Charles Koppelman that {{she was ready to}} release a crossover album. EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career. In spite of this, Selena included the song on Entre a Mi Mundo.|$|E

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|Black was {{the author}} of the {{landmark}} decision in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which ruled that the states must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one.

5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative.

It does not, he argued, demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.|$|E
