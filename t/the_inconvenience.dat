5|$|On 13 July 2010, the rescheduled concert dates were {{announced}} for 2011, beginning 11 May in Mexico City, Mexico, and ending 30 July in Moncton, Canada. Bono apologised for <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> to fans over their affected travel plans, but {{noted that it}} had given the band the opportunity to record new material in the studio which U2 were considering playing live.|$|E
5|$|In early November 2011, Rocksteady {{confirmed}} {{that it was}} investigating reports by numerous users that save files for the Xbox 360 version of the game were being erased without prompting, resulting in players losing their progress and being unable to complete the game. On launch, performance issues arose for the PC version when DirectX 11 features were enabled; the developer acknowledged <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> and recommended running the game with DirectX 9 until a title update was released to address this matter.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

5|$|When I assumed office, I {{found that}} my {{predecessor}} {{had signed a}} contract for {{the building of the}} battleship Rio de Janeiro, a vessel of 32,000tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.|$|E
5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience.</b> Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{behind the}} church is Tre Kronor castle. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and {{subsequently}} replaced by the Stockholm Palace, it was named after the central citadel, a large gun tower emblazoned with the Three Crowns symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown. While {{it is not known}} when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century. Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to Lübeck, expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed. In the painting {{to the right of the}} church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction, the exposed roof trusses confirming <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> experienced by the monarch.|$|E

5|$|Indications {{are that}} society in North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from their masters, many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families of their former masters.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

25|$|While private {{nuisance}} is always actionable, public nuisance is not. A claimant of public nuisance has to establish special loss {{over and above}} <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> suffered by the public in general, as public nuisance is a crime {{and it would be}} unreasonable for everyone inconvenienced by it to be allowed to claim. This distinction was followed in India, along with the UK principles of nuisance.|$|E

However exchange-traded gold instruments, even those that hold physical gold {{for the benefit of the}} investor, carry risks beyond those inherent in the precious metal itself. For example, the most popular gold ETP (GLD) has been widely criticized, and even compared with mortgage-backed securities, due to features of its complex structure.|$|E

25|$|An {{attempt was}} made to find a better method of {{implementing}} warfarin therapy without <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> of regular monitoring and risk of intracranial hemorrhage. A combination of aspirin and fixed-dose warfarin (initial INR 1.2-1.5) was tried. Unfortunately, in a study of AF patients with additional risk factors for thromboembolism, the combination of aspirin and the lower dose of warfarin was significantly inferior to the standard adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0), yet still had a similar risk of intracranial hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|In March 1822, José Bernardo de Tagle, Marquis of Torre Tagle and Supreme Delegate of the Republic, who {{replaced}} San Martín provisionally when the latter traveled to Guayaquil, decreed a new {{design for the}} flag.

This modification was justified, according to Torre Tagle, by <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience</b> {{in the construction of}} the previous version, among other issues.|$|E
25|$|In {{defense of}} the ordinance, the city's court filings argued six key points, among them that their helmet law was {{constitutional}} and did not contradict the state traffic code. Myrtle Beach's attorney Mike Battle also argued that because the state law was silent on whether adults must wear helmets, only addressing riders under 21, that cities had the freedom {{to make their own}} laws with respect to those over 21. Battle also argued that the benefits of the helmet law were greater than <b>the</b> <b>inconvenience.</b>|$|E
