5|$|My Bloody Valentine are an Irish {{rock band}} formed in Dublin in 1983. Since 1987, the band's lineup has {{consisted}} of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar) and Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums), with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). <b>Their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> known for integrating experimental guitar techniques, ethereal melody, and unorthodox production approaches, resulting in their pioneering a musical style known as shoegazing {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E
5|$|While the Rashtrakutas built {{many fine}} monuments in the Deccan, the most {{extensive}} and sumptuous of <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> the monolithic Kailasanatha temple at Ellora, the temple being a splendid achievement. In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal. All of the monuments are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Boom! Studios {{produced}} a Monsters Inc. comic book mini-series that ran for four issues. The storyline takes {{place after the}} movie and focuses on Sulley and Mike's daily struggles to operate Monsters Inc. on its new laughter-focused company policy. At the same time, <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> impeded by the revenge schemes of Randall and Waternoose, {{as well as a}} human child (indirectly revealed to be Sid Phillips from the Toy Story franchise) who has hijacked the company's closet door technology to commit a string of toy thefts throughout the human world.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, recessions {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. <b>Their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.|$|E
5|$|McNulty is a patrolman {{and lives}} with Beadie Russell. He politely refuses offers from Daniels {{who is now}} a major and {{commanding}} the Western District.

5|$|Shimer first {{offered a}} year of study abroad (in Paris) in 1961, and the college has had a {{biennial}} program in Oxford since 1963. The Shimer-in-Oxford program allows third- or fourth-year students to study {{for one or two}} semesters in Oxford, supervised by a Shimer professor. Students take a core class each term with the supervising faculty; the rest of <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> completed in tutorials of self-selected subjects under the guidance of academics associated with the University of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} the men {{galvanized}} the missionary effort in the United States, sparking an outpouring of funding for evangelization efforts around the world. <b>Their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> still frequently remembered in evangelical publications, and in 2006 {{was the subject of}} the film production End of the Spear. Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, Elisabeth, and the sister of Nate Saint, Rachel, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) to live among the Huaorani. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some of those involved in the killing. While largely eliminating tribal violence, their efforts exposed the tribe to increased influence from the outside.|$|E
5|$|Chief Vanuatu, {{leader of}} the bigfoots, in {{recognition}} of the pair's actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell that will make the world safe for bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell's four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max's help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur, and a vortex contained within a snow globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> done, Sam and Max take the frozen ice block containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has been returned to them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.|$|E

5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers a {{surveillance}} camera in her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} overwritten numerous times like a palimpsest, to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man with ties to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes. <b>Their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), bleeding from a chest wound.|$|E
5|$|These {{simulations}} {{showed the}} basic idea of how a single large planet can shepherd the smaller extreme trans-Neptunian objects into similar types of orbits. It was a basic proof of concept simulation that did not obtain a unique orbit for the planet as they state there are many possible orbital configurations the planet could have. Thus they did not fully formulate a model that successfully incorporated all the clustering of the extreme objects with an orbit for the planet. But {{they were the first}} to notice there was a clustering in the orbits of extremely distant objects and that the most likely reason was from an unknown massive distant planet. <b>Their</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> very similar to how Alexis Bouvard noticed Uranus' motion was peculiar and suggested that it was likely gravitational forces from an unknown 8th planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune.|$|E
