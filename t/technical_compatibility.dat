In their quest for efficient operation, firms increasingly revert to seeking new technologies via interfirm agreements, not only with suppliers and customers but also with competitors. The advantages of R&D alliance will be explored in this paper. The survey conducted using questionnaires sent by mail focused on three big areas, the motivation factors, risk factors and success & failure factors of R&D alliance. Our study on the R&D alliance shows that whilst firms have some common factors in forming an R&D alliance; <b>technical</b> <b>compatibility,</b> gain market power, market access the local and foreign firms have some dissimilarities in their motivations towards forming of R&D alliance. It is apparent that local firms seek strategic advantages of long term profitability, market access and improving competitive advantage.

The survey also showed that risks faced by companies remain a concern among firms in R&D alliance. One of the major concerns is differing aims among alliance partners and leakage of information to the alliance partner.

30|$|Information {{technology}} adoption theory {{constitutes an}} emerging facet {{of information systems}} research. It examines the behavioral characteristics of organizations and individuals as they adopt and accept information technologies based on principles of social psychology and behavioral science to determine ways in which users accept and continue to use information technologies (Li 2006). The theory {{plays an important role}} in studying the introduction of RFID technologies into the management of agricultural products. Fichman (1992) summarized numerous factors influencing information technology adoption and classified information technology adoption theories into two categories: theories focused on individual-level adoption behaviors and those focused on organizational-level adoption behaviors. There are relatively few organization-level information technology adoption behavior theories (Li 2011). Some classic theories include Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), the six-stage model, and the TOE analysis framework. Tornatzky and Fleischer (1990) criticized IDT and maintained that classical innovation diffusion theory is critical of the notion that factors affecting information technology adoption include not only technology elements (T) but also characteristic elements of organizations (O) and environmental elements (E). After the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework was first proposed, many scholars began to study TOE theory and related influencing factors due to its applicability. TOE theory considers technological issues in terms of <b>technical</b> <b>compatibilities,</b> complexities, observability levels, etc. as well as organizational factors such as the size of an organization, high-level support received, organizational cultures, etc. and environmental factors such as external competitive pressures and government policy support. Chau and Tam (1997) used the TOE framework to analyze factors that affect open-system adoption. Kuan and Chau (2001) proposed a perception-based small business EDI adoption model tested against data collected from 575 small firms in Hong Kong based on the TOE theoretical framework. Grandon and Pearson (2004) examined determinant factors of strategic value and electronic commerce adoption as perceived by upper managers in small- and medium-sized enterprises in the Midwest region of the US. Zhang and Kang (2008) analyzed influencing factors and countermeasures of logistics information network technologies. Li (2011) designed a process model for analyzing factors shaping RFID adoption in the automobile manufacturing industry and applied it through a case study on China’s automobile manufacturing industry.|$|R

Therefore, the development of e-learning must use a socio-technical perspective. In this case the technological and social factors are developed together, since both have a reciprocal relationship.

40|$|International audienceDomain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are now {{developed}} {{for a wide}} variety of domains to address specific concerns in the development of complex systems. When engineering new DSLs, it is likely that previous efforts spent on the development of other languages could be leveraged, especially when their domains overlap. However, legacy DSLs may not fit exactly the end user requirements and thus require further extension, restriction, or specialization. While current language workbenches provide import mechanisms, they usually lack an explicit support for such customizations of imported artifacts. In this paper, we propose an approach for building DSLs by safely assembling and customizing legacy DSLs artifacts. This approach is based on typing relations that provide a reasoning layer for manipulating DSLs while ensuring type safety. On top of this reasoning layer, we provide an algebra of operators for extending, restricting, and assembling separate DSL artifacts. We implemented the typing relations and algebra into the Melange metalanguage. We illustrate Melange through the modular definition of an executable modeling language for the Internet Of Things domain. We show how it eases the definition of new DSLs by maximizing the reuse of legacy artifacts without introducing issues in terms of performance, <b>technical</b> ecosystem <b>compatibility,</b> or generated code volume...|$|R
