5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only in <b>the</b> <b>short-term.</b> There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in <b>the</b> <b>short-term.</b> The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>short-term</b> use of benzodiazepines {{adversely}} affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} in <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> {{management of}} {{generalized anxiety disorder}} (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall. According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), benzodiazepines {{can be used in}} the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E

At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} only way the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E

5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following {{the retirement of}} Harry Wainwright due to ill health.

Maunsell took control of <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> situation by improving existing designs, and he introduced new engines to progressively replace obsolete classes. New designs could also cut costs on the SECR, as one capable mixed-traffic locomotive could undertake the work of two separate passenger or freight types.
