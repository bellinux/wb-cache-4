5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> a more {{westerly}} {{track on}} September23, a hurricane watch was issued for the northwestern Bahamas, later superseded by a warning, and a hurricane warning was declared for eastern Cuba. Early on September24, all watches and warnings for the Caribbean Islands, including the Bahamas, were discontinued as Emily moved {{out over the}} Atlantic Ocean. On September25, a special advisory was issued for Bermuda as tropical storm-force winds were likely to impact the island. Following the unexpected intensification, another special advisory was issued stating that hurricane-force winds would impact the island during the day on September25. This advisory was discontinued following the storms' passage later that day.|$|E
5|$|The United States Coast Guard urged marine {{interests}} and boaters in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina to take precaution {{to protect their}} lives and vessels. In Florida, the Gulf Islands National Seashore closed their campground and a beach front road. Additionally, several states parks were closed and campers were evacuated. At Pensacola Beach, condominium associations asked residents to remove furniture from high balconies due to <b>the</b> <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> strong winds. A state of emergency was issued for Taylor County, where two shelters were opened.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, an {{existing}} tropical storm watch was extended northward to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. The next day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was extended northward to Plymouth, Massachusetts, but was soon replaced by a hurricane warning. The watch stretching to the Merrimack River was then replaced by a warning. By 0900 UTC on September 17, all tropical cyclone advisories were lifted. In Connecticut, utility companies readied supplies and emergency crews {{in advance of the}} hurricane. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with <b>the</b> <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> heavy rains, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared to send eight teams into the field to take measurements along 30 rivers. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond advised residents to prepare for the storm's onslaught. The storm disrupted many residents' travel plans in the state, while people evacuated from certain coastal communities. The threat of Hurricane Floyd forced schools, malls, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst to close.|$|E

All remaining errors are mine. 1 We simulate a standard Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model {{to analyze the}} sensibility of market crashes to <b>the</b> <b>anticipations</b> <b>of</b> endowment drops. Contrary to the commonly accepted view that market crashes are solely driven by large drops in aggregate endow-ments, we observe in complete markets that: 1 - a large and subjective <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> an endowment drop amplifies {{the magnitude of the}} crash regardless of the level of risk-aversion, and 2 - there always ex-ists an upper-bound on <b>the</b> maximal <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drop so that the crash magnitude remains constant regardless of the drop level.

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Kim moved into Cambodia and then across {{the rest of}} Indochina while producing {{a large amount of}} convection. Under <b>the</b> <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> regeneration in the Andaman Sea, a TCFA was again issued by the JTWC during the afternoon hours on October18. Early the next day, the JTWC classified Kim as a tropical depression. Initially, the regenerated depression was expected to move across the southern tip of Burma and intensify further in the Bay of Bengal. Even though Kim moved across southern Burma as expected, it never moved into the Bay of Bengal. Instead, it drifted northwards along the coast of Burma, parallel to the Arakan Mountain Range and gradually weakened. The JTWC issued their last warning on Kim at 18:00UTC on October20 while located over the Arakan Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Starting on February7, {{tropical}} cyclone alerts and later gale warnings were issued {{for the northern}} Cook Islands under <b>the</b> <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> gale-force winds impacting populated islands. The first of these islands were Manihiki, Rakahanga, and Suwarrow. As the storm moved southward, the advisories shifted accordingly. Strong wind warnings were raised for Pukapuka, Nassau, and Penryhn on February8; however, they were dropped later that day as Cyclone Pat moved away. Alerts on potential gales in the southern Cook Islands also began on February8, including the islands of Atiu, Aitutaki, Manuae, Mitiaro, and Takutea. Gale warnings for Aitutaki, Palmerston, and Rarotonga began on February9 and extended to Mauke the next day. Early on February10, a hurricane warning was issued for Aitutaki. With the core of Pat's destructive winds forecast to pass close to or over the island, sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and gusts of 185km/h (115mph) were anticipated. The aforementioned warnings were allowed to expire once Pat cleared the Cook Islands on February11 and {{was no longer a}} threat.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by Bushnell and Dabney during 1970–71 to be a coin-operated version of Spacewar. After the pair were {{unable to find a}} way to economically run the game on a minicomputer such as the Data General Nova, they hit upon the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom-designed hardware created just to run that game. After they built an early proof of concept and founded Syzygy Engineering, Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. Working in partnership with Nutting, the pair ran their first location test in August 1971, a few months prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game, also based on Spacewar. After encouraging initial results, though mixed responses from distributors, Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units with <b>the</b> <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> a hit game. While the game was successful and validated Syzygy's belief in the future of arcade video games, selling over 1,000 cabinets by mid-1972 and ultimately 1,300–1,500 units, it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for. The game spawned one clone game, Star Trek (1972), and Nutting produced a two-player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from Syzygy before closing in 1976. Syzygy went on to be incorporated as Atari, with their next arcade game the successful Pong (1972). Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release marked the initial start of the commercial video game industry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{universal}} Turing {{machine is}} an anticipatory theory of computability by any digital or quantum machine. However the Church-Turing hypothesis only gives weak <b>anticipation.</b> <b>The</b> construction <b>of</b> the quantum computer (unlike classical computing) requires theory with strong anticipation. Category theory provides the necessary coordinate-free mathematical language {{which is both}} constructive and non-local to subsume the various interpretations of quantum theory in one pullback/pushout Dolittle diagram. This diagram {{can be used to}} test and classify physical devices and proposed algorithms for weak or strong anticipation. Quantum Information Science is more than a merger of Church-Turing and quantum theories. It has constructively to bridge the non-local chasm between <b>the</b> weak <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> mathematics and <b>the</b> strong <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> physics...|$|R

40|$|Apollonius' {{evaluations}} of the two phases of Medea's magical powers in Apollonius' "Argonautica" are different: positive sympathy for their contribution {{to the success of}} the Argonautic enterprise, and progressively negative presentation of her "initiatives" after its conclusion [...] and thus, perhaps, opposition between <b>the</b> <b>anticipations</b> <b>of</b> Medea's TRAGIC operation at Corinth and her positive role within the boundaries of the EPIC narrative of Jason's expedition...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} our approach, we correlated the proposed coordination indicators {{derived from the}} sensor data with three validation criteria. We used perceived implicit and explicit coordination to validate the indicators. Explicit coordination includes those actions intentionally used for team coordination and is achieved by means of verbal communication. By contrast, implicit coordination refers to <b>the</b> <b>anticipations</b> <b>of</b> others members’ actions and the dynamic adjustment of one’s own actions accordingly, {{without the need for}} overt communication [37].|$|R
25|$|The {{opposite}} position (short-term {{interest rates}} higher than long-term) can also occur. For instance, in November 2004, the yield curve for UK Government bonds was partially inverted. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market's anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents. Negative liquidity premiums can also exist if long-term investors dominate the market, but the prevailing {{view is that}} a positive liquidity premium dominates, so only <b>the</b> <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> falling interest rates will cause an inverted yield curve. Strongly inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic depressions.|$|E
