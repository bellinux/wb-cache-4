5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>countries</b> in the world, with a high {{population}} growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened {{with high levels of}} debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E

40|$|We analyse {{trade in}} {{vertically}} differentiated goods between {{a rich and}} a <b>poor</b> <b>country.</b> In autarky two monopolists, selling a single product, operate in two countries which differ only for their per capita income. If trade opens, the firm operating in <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> exports to <b>the</b> rich, giving rise to one-way trade. Consumers of the rich country and the firm of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> benefit from trade. Liberalization may hurt the consumers in <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> if their per capita income is quite low vis à vis {{the one of the}} rich country. Trade in vertically differentiated goods brings about an overall gain if countries are quite far apart in terms of standard of living. Real wages increase in both countries as a result of trade, but relatively more in the rich country. As a remedy to the trade deficit, the rich country may set an import reducing tariff that, only under certain conditions, may benefit also the firm of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> and increase total welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse, through a {{theoretical}} model, the effects that the trade integration of two countries may have on industrial location, growth and welfare. The conclusions reached finally depend both on whether the import or the export costs are affected by the trade policies on which the integration process is based and on whether the rich or <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> introduces them. In general, when integration leads to an increase of industrial concentration in the rich country, the growth rate increases and welfare improves in both countries. If integration means that industry moves to <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country,</b> <b>the</b> growth rate decreases; in spite of this, in this case <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> can also improve its welfare. ...|$|R

His offered a very simple explanation: <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> exported their primary resources to the rich countries, the rich countries used these raw materials to manufacture consumer goods and then sell back to <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> at value-added costs. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> would always end up with trade deficits.
