5|$|A {{cold-core low}} {{pressure}} system near Gustav was forecast <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the development}} of the system; however, the tropical storm continued to intensify, attaining hurricane status around 1200UTC on August26. Not long after attaining hurricane-status, the ridge steering Gustav to the west began to break down, causing the hurricane to slowly turn towards the north. By 0600UTC on August27, the storm attained Category 2 intensity, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles, passing 205miles (330km) to the east. By this time, hurricane and tropical storm-force winds extended 35miles (55km) and 175miles (280km) from the center respectively.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} serious crop {{failures}} in the late 19th century led to widespread famines on the subcontinent {{in which it is}} estimated that over 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany was beginning <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than {{the quantity of}} cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers {{were not to be}} attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{recorded}} from impala include Damalinia aepycerus, D. elongata, Linognathus aepycerus and L. nevilli; in a study, ivermectin (a medication against parasites) {{was found}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on Boophilus decoloratus and Linognathus species, though not on Damalinia species. In {{a study of}} impala in South Africa, the number of worms in juveniles showed an increase with age, reaching a peak when impala turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as Cooperia, Cooperoides, Fasciola, Gongylonema. Haemonchus, Impalaia, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus; some of these showed seasonal variations in density.|$|E

5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dixon {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} his ship alongside the Spanish frigate {{and opened a}} heavy fire, to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside. The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea, and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered. As Santa Dorotea veered off course, O'Neil passed Lion for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> and again he came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail {{in the direction of}} Cartagena at 13:10. Gerraro, his isolated ship trapped by Lion, which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E

40|$|In this review, seven {{studies using}} photoradiation to treat carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) are discussed: two controlled studies that observed real laser <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better <b>effect</b> than sham laser, to treat CTS; three open-protocol studies that observed real laser <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> beneficial <b>effect</b> <b>to</b> treat CTS; and two studies that did not observe real laser <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better <b>effect</b> than <b>a</b> control condition, to treat CTS. In the five studies that ob-served beneficial effect from real laser, higher laser dosages (9 Joules, 12 – 30 Joules, 32 J/cm 2, 225 J/cm 2) were used at the primary treatment sites (median nerve at the wrist, or cervical neck area), than dosages in the two studies where real laser was not observed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better <b>effect</b> than <b>a</b> control condition (1. 8 Joules or 6 J/cm 2). The average success rate across the first five studies was 84 % (SD, 8. 9; total hands = 171). The average pain duration prior to successful photoradiation was 2 years. Photoradiation is a promising new, conservative treatment for mild/moderate CTS cases (motor latency < 7 msec; needle EMG, normal). It is cost-effective compared to current treatments...|$|R
