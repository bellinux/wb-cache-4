5|$|In 2013, Qatar {{started up}} the world's largest helium unit, {{although}} the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected helium production there. 2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business, following years of renowned shortages. Nasdaq reported (2015) that for Air Products, an international corporation <b>that</b> <b>sells</b> gases for industrial use, helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} debut, the ads {{came under fire}} from several fronts. Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing the commercials, that he was selling out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain <b>that</b> <b>sells</b> products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E

5|$|Håkan Jeppsson, CEO of Inwido, a Swedish company <b>that</b> <b>sells</b> {{windows and}} doors, was elected as the club's new {{chairman}} in February 2010. Jeppsson {{had previously been}} a member of the board and vice-chairman during the last years of Madsen's time in charge. Jeppsson's first year as chairman proved to be markedly different from those directly preceding it, as the club won its 19th league title in November 2010. The championship was much celebrated by the club's fans because it coincided with the club's centenary, and also because Malmö FF clinched the title two points ahead of their local rivals Helsingborgs IF in the final standings. The second Swedish championship of Jeppssons chairmanship was won in the 2013 season where the title was secured in the penultimate round of the league. The club also won Svenska Supercupen for the first time in 2013 with a 3–2 win against rivals IFK Göteborg. In the following season Malmö FF won yet another league title and entered the group stage of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the club's history.|$|E
5|$|There was initial {{confusion}} as to {{how this}} game would be distributed to consumers, after the announcement {{that it would be}} a multiplayer-only title. Sony announced on May 16, 2007, that there would be two iterations of the game. The game alone is downloadable from the PlayStation Store for US$29.99 (£19.99, €29.99), with an initial download size of 798MB. This version is restricted to the PlayStation Network account that buys it. The second is a retail Blu-ray Disc version <b>that</b> <b>sells</b> for $59.99 (the standard retail price of most PlayStation 3 games upon release), bundled with a Jabra BT125 Bluetooth headset in America and the Jabra BT135 in Europe, allowing players to chat with other players online while playing the game. An additional third was later released on October 10, 2007 without the inclusion of a USB headset, which was priced at US$39.99. Both retail versions feature extra content such as behind-the-scenes developer interviews, concept art and trailers. Warhawk was re-released as a Greatest Hits title on July 28, 2008 for $29.99.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{question}} of whether companies <b>that</b> <b>sell</b> assets to private equity funds experience higher abnormal returns than companies <b>that</b> <b>sell</b> assets to buyers with strategic interests. Moreover, we investigate whether companies <b>that</b> <b>sell</b> assets to private equity investors have different changes in systematic risks than companies <b>that</b> <b>sell</b> to strategic buyers. Using data for asset sales in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and employing event study methodology, we find that the announcement of asset sales generally generates positive abnormal returns with the transactions where there is a private equity buyer having significantly higher abnormal returns compared to transactions where there is a strategic buyer. On the other hand, we find no evidence of changes in systematic risk, neither for the sample consisting of all transactions nor for the sub-samples of sales to private equity funds and strategic buyers, respectively.
