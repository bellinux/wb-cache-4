For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet. She was strong in a {{realistic}} kind of way. I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sister’s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I think if you saw Valene today she’d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E
500|$|Musician Harry Connick Jr., {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Leo. He {{received}} a call from co-creators Kohan and Max Mutchnick asking him to appear on Will & Grace, and agreed to do it after learning that it was his wife's favorite show. According to Debra Messing, who plays Grace, Kohan and Mutchnick had a specific vision of Grace's husband from the start. They thought it was important that Grace meet a [...] "menschy, nice Jewish man who happens to be a hottie, and that's what we got with Harry Connick Jr," [...] she said. According to The Nation magazine, {{this was the first time}} that a prime-time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Connick, who is part-Jewish, said he enjoyed the fact that he was not asked to sing on the show, because [...] "it throws you out of character a little bit when that stuff happens. It's been great just doing the acting thing." [...] Messing, in discussing Grace and Leo's relationship, commented that it is [...] "unlike anything that Grace has ever been a part of before and just the little that we've done so far, it feels wonderful to be playing with Harry." [...] In another interview, also discussing the characters' relationship, she explained, [...] "...bringing Leo into it and making it a viable and potent relationship for Grace, that's never happened before. I think she's a little less frenetic and neurotic, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> being in love markedly changes Grace. That sexual energy in a great way has shaken things up, because it is the greatest threat to the friendship of Will and Grace to date." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mountains was the band's final album for BNA. Released in 2007, it was {{produced}} by Mark Bright, whose other production credits include Blackhawk, Rascal Flatts, and Carrie Underwood. Its title track, co-written by Larry Boone, went to number 10 on the country charts, while followup [...] "Nothing to Prove" [...] peaked at 51. Erlewine criticized the band for taking [...] "fewer risks than ever" [...] on the album. In March 2007, Lonestar was dropped from BNA's roster due to declining sales. Guitarist Michael Britt attributes the group's commercial downfall in the mid-2000s to the label's choices in singles, saying {{in an interview with}} CMT, [...] "I think we painted ourselves into a corner... They started putting out a bunch of family-type songs. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> pigeonholed us. The majority of the band didn't really want to continue doing that same thing. But that's what kept getting put out." ...|$|E

50|$|It’s {{important}} to not underestimate your listeners, {{the worst thing}} a band or musician {{can do is to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> their audience is less capable off themselves, because than you always write to the lowest common denominator and that is how you write shit music. But if you consider your audience to be highly intelligent, and highly capable of taking to musical journeys, than you’re always trying to write something above yourself and reach further. I <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>really</b> important. Expect the unexpected.|$|R
60|$|Now that I look back, I can scarce {{conceive}} why {{it should}} have so wrought upon me; for, in truth, the little love I bore the Lord Giovanni might rather have led me to rejoice that his imposture should be laid bare to the eyes of all the world. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> there was an element of fear in my feelings--fear that, upon reflection, Madonna Paola might ask herself how came that burning sincerity into the love-songs written in her honour which it was now disclosed that I had penned. The answer she might find to such a question was one that might arouse her pride and so outrage it as to lead her to cast me out of her friendship and never again suffer me to approach her.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is another}} way of {{flattering}} important people which has become very common, I notice, among writers in the newspapers and elsewhere. It consists in applying to them the phrases [...] "simple," [...] or [...] "quiet," [...] or [...] "modest," [...] without any sort of meaning or relation to the person to whom they are applied. To be simple is the best thing in the world; to be modest is the next best thing. I am not so sure about being quiet. I am rather inclined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> modest people make a great deal of noise. It is quite self-evident that really simple people make a great deal of noise. But simplicity and modesty, at least, are very rare and royal human virtues, not to be lightly talked about. Few human beings, and at rare intervals, have really risen into being modest; not one man in ten or in twenty has by long wars become simple, as an actual old soldier does by long wars become simple. These virtues are not things to fling about as mere flattery; many prophets and righteous men have desired to see these things and have not seen them. But in the description of the births, lives, and deaths of very luxurious men they are used incessantly and quite without thought. If a journalist has to describe a great politician or financier (the things are substantially the same) entering a room or walking down a thoroughfare, he always says, [...] "Mr. Midas was quietly dressed in a black frock coat, a white waistcoat, and light grey trousers, with a plain green tie and simple flower in his button-hole." [...] As if any one would expect him to have a crimson frock coat or spangled trousers. As if any one would expect him to have a burning Catherine wheel in his button-hole.|$|E
5000|$|The Pro12 {{began this}} year with an away match for Glasgow Warriors at the {{defending}} champions Connacht, the club that had wrested the title from them the previous season. The Warriors players were eager for the match and secured a try bonus victory at Galway Sportgrounds; Peter Horne later said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> told when we finally played {{them in the first}} game of the season and hammered them. It was frustration about why we hadn't been able to do it at the end of last year." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} held on November 3, 1970, Curtis defeated James S. Erwin by a mere 890 votes. Erwin blamed the media for his loss, claiming they were biased toward Curtis. Years later, Erwin noted, [...] "I avoided the media. I didn't like them and they didn't like me, in retrospect, I wish I had formed a more beneficial relationship with the media. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> hurt my campaign."

[...] He has also noted that on the show, [...] "We staff {{have a lot of}} horror comedy elements that I don't see anywhere else. I wrote for The Simpsons for a few years, and Treehouse of Horror was always the highlight of the year, but I always sort of wanted more of that. But because of the structure of The Simpsons, it wasn't really possible, being it was so specifically based on this grounded family." ...|$|E

The official music video was directed by Bieber’s personal videographer Rory Kramer and released on June 8, 2016. It’s a documentary-style compilation of clips of the singer on his world travels. According to Bieber in a statement, [...] "Personally, I love this video because it’s an honest look at my journey. The process of putting together this album and this tour — surrounded by people I love to be with — has been really special. I’m proud of it, it’s been a lot of fun and lot of hard work, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> shows in video.

5000|$|Dixon {{sports a}} short hair style to help portray Tilly's {{androgynous}} style. She told Elizabeth Horsfall from AGENT2 Magazine that her character's style is also quirky and edgy. Dixon and the Hollyoaks stylist started off buying clothes for Tilly in Topshop because it carries many different styles, {{which made it}} easier to [...] "stamp a trend" [...] on what the character was going to be like, before searching further stores. Dixon was initially unsure when the stylist picked out prints that clashed, as she knew she would never wear them in real life, but they worked for her character. The actress hoped that viewers would be able to relate to Tilly, especially as she does not make a big issue out {{of the fact that she}} is a lesbian. Dixon commented [...] "She's not defined by her sexuality, nobody is and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> shines through." [...] The actress explained that she was excited about playing a lesbian character because she had not played one before and thought it would be a challenge. She said Tilly was comfortable with her sexuality and thought that she was the first young lesbian character that the show had really developed.|$|E
