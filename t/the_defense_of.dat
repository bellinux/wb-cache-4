5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to {{about a quarter of the}} USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E
