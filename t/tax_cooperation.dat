We investigate the possibility of welfare improving active tax policies, in particular capital and labor income tax, under the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium and the cooperative equilibrium. Unlike the conventional wisdom regarding stabilization policies, optimal tax policies in our economy are procyclical. Relative to the non-cooperative setting, international <b>tax</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> requires more active tax policies (about two times) and generates large extra welfare gains (by about a third).

We investigate the incentives for sub-central <b>tax</b> authority <b>cooperation</b> in a decentralised context, with the aim of identifying the determinants of that cooperation. Our results are congruent with standard theory; in particular, the existence of reciprocity is essential for sharing tax information, but there is sluggishness in this process, which is partly the result of the short-sighted behaviour of tax authorities influenced by budget constraints. Hence, this is good news for the functioning of a decentralised tax administration as, in the medium to long run, the gains to be made from sharing tax information are achieved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} optimal {{income taxation}} in a two-country OLG economy, where each country {{is characterized by}} asymmetric information {{between the government and}} the private sector, and where one of the countries outsources part of its production to the other. In the country whose firms outsource production abroad, the government will respond to outsourcing by implementing a more progressive labor income tax structure and higher marginal capital income tax rates than it would have done in the absence of outsourcing. The tax policy response by the government in the country that receives foreign production capacity is, in general, ambiguous and depends on a tradeoff between wage-equality and factor income from abroad. By using the noncooperative Nash equilibrium as a reference case, we also consider <b>tax</b> policy <b>cooperation</b> leading to higher welfare. outsourcing, redistribution, optimal nonlinear taxation, intertemporal model...|$|R
40|$|Countries have {{possibility}} {{to choose between}} several alternatives for cooperation in international tax matters at global level. They can decide not to cooperate or provide some form of <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Because of harmful tax competition among countries and efforts of international organizations, all {{countries in the world}} are oblidged to comply with one of multiple alternatives for <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Situation in European Union (hereinafter EU) is specific. EU is not country or classic international organization. By the reason of its successful functioning, EU has need for <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation.</b> EU has attempted to harmonise tax policies of member states, but member states did not approve that. Only indirect taxes are harmonized on EU level, direct taxes are harmonized only to the point necessarily for functioning of single market. That is why <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation</b> instruments are so important. Object of this paper are procedures and measures, stipulated by the most important instrument in the field of <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation</b> enacted by institutions of EU, its development and status in international tax law.

40|$|Tax {{competition}} between independent authorities {{is known to}} lead to inefficient outcomes, implying there is scope for cooperation. In an international framework where the authorities are national governments, the undesirable features of tax competition may alternatively be mitigated by imposing restrictions on international capital flows. Using a two-country model it is shown that capital controls may fully remedy the adverse effects of tax competition and thereby render <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation</b> superfluous. In more general cases, however, capital controls have some undesirable side-effects, leaving room for cooperative actions.

40|$|The {{liberalization}} of international financial flows and {{foreign direct investment}} has induced countries to use diverse measures to attract inflow of foreign capital and foreign direct investment, {{which is expected to}} {{have a positive effect on}} the growth of GDP and thus a positive effect on social welfare. Tax exemption, reduction of tax rate, tax holiday, or diverse subsidies are some of the most important measures used. In this paper we study international <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation,</b> i. e., countries change and especially reduce tax rate for corporate income or for asset revenues to attract inflow of foreign direct investment. Both theoretical and empirical studies have shown the sensibility of foreign direct investment decision with respect to tax rate differences between home countries and host countries. In general, more inflow of foreign direct investment can be expected if the tax rate of the home country is lower than that of foreign countries. This is the main reason for international <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In this paper we propose a simple model to prove the sub-optimal Nash non cooperative solution in a two-country tax-competition game. The model shows that international <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation</b> can improve welfare of the participating countries. How to reach a cooperative solution for an international tax competition game (ITCG) is therefore an important issue for further discussions and studies.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{quantitative}} assessment of the welfare cost of tax competition or, equivalently, the welfare benefit of international <b>tax</b> policy <b>cooperation.</b> We use a simple multi-country general equilibrium model of a world economy, {{in which there are}} two types of cross-country spillovers: the first one generated by the international capital mobility and, the second one, by the presence of international public goods. In the absence of international public goods, although welfare in the non-cooperative case is typically lower than in the cooperative case, the welfare difference is negligible quantitatively. Things change drastically, both quantitatively and qualitatively, once we introduce international public goods. Now, there can be big benefits from cooperation and welfare effects cease to be monotonic. (JEL classification codes: F 02, H 2, H 4) Copyright The Author 2009.

The higher the degree of institutionalization of the regime, the higher the perceived levels of legitimacy, efficiency and credibility, so <b>taxes</b> that require <b>cooperation</b> and compliance can be more effectively collected from the population. Institutionalized regimes thus make sense if non-tax revenue sources are scarce so limited representation must be granted in exchange of economic support.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of inter-municipal {{cooperation}} on local taxation. Municipalities that join/create an inter-municipal jurisdiction choose between three tax regimes, which may induce both horizontal and vertical tax externalities. Using the differences in differences method with a quasi-exhaustive panel for French municipalities over the 1994 - 2010 period, we show a positive causal effect of cooperation on the level of cumulative tax rates (i. e. the sum of municipal and inter-municipal tax rates). In addition, we show that cooperation leads to a convergence of tax rates within an inter-municipal structure, which thus reduces tax disparities among municipalities.

We examine how <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation</b> influences investment in infrastructure and find that welfare may be lower under <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation</b> than under tax competition; this is, in fact, the case when infrastructure is sufficiently effective in raising the tax base and generates a suffi ciently large negative interregional externality...|$|E

We consider three different tax regimes: tax-base sharing for the two tax bases, tax harmonization of one tax rate, and a mixed form of the preceding two regimes. In this framework, both horizontal externalities (at the municipal and inter-municipal level) and vertical tax externalities (bottom-up and top-down) occur. We show that cooperation generates an increase of tax burden, whatever the form of <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and we provide a comparison of the different tax regimes...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{empirical}} studies have mainly analyzed tax competition, neglecting {{the role of}} <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation</b> in international taxation. We focus on German double taxation agreements (DTAs) and show for up to 45 tax treaties that the bargaining outcomes depend on investment asymmetries between the countries. A transition from a purely symmetrical country pair to a situation where foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in only one direction would increase on average the negotiated withholding tax rate by roughly 5 percentage points. We also show that bargaining over DTAs is not only about withholding tax rates, {{but also about the}} definition of a permanent establishment (PE). Our results are robust with regard to the concept of investment asymmetries (either in shares or levels) and different operationalizations (FDI stocks or sales). double taxation agreements, foreign direct investment, international <b>tax</b> <b>cooperation,</b> withholding tax...|$|E

However, evading sales, excise or trade <b>taxes</b> requires the <b>cooperation</b> {{of at least two}} taxpayers. When individuals evade taxes, they face two potential costs.

An increase in the sanction for tax evasion leads to a direct increase in the expected cost of a transaction in the illegal sector. However, it may also reduce the incentive to cheat. It may then be that a small increase in the sanction reduces the total cost of transacting in the illegal sector. Tax evasion may increase as a result. Tax Evasion; Cooperation; Sanctions...|$|R

In general, this model allocates the primary right to tax to the country from which capital investment originates (i.e., the home, or resident country) rather than the country in which the investment is made (the host, or source country). As a result, it is most effective as between two countries with reciprocal investment flows (such as among the OECD member countries), but can be very unbalanced when one of the signatory countries is economically weaker than the other (such as between OECD and non-OECD pairings).|$|R

This instrument consists in a standard ambient tax divided {{by the number of}} firms, which requires polluters to cooperate in order to achieve the social optimum. To enable polluters to cooperate, communication is allowed. We introduce different types of communication: cheap talk, exogenous costly communication (communication is imposed), and endogenous costly communication (conducted on a voluntary basis after a vote). Our experiment confirms that the instrument induces polluters to reduce their emissions under cheap talk. However, we find that group emissions are less reduced when communication is costly.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} research has revealed forms {{of human behavior}} involving interaction among unrelated individuals that have proven difficult to explain in terms of kin or reciprocal altruism. One such trait, strong reciprocity is a predisposition to cooperate with others and to punish those who violate the norms of cooperation, at personal cost, {{even when it is}} implausible to expect that these costs will be repaid. We present evidence supporting strong reciprocity as a schema for predicting and understanding altruism in humans. We show that under conditions plausibly characteristic of the early stages of human evolution, a small number of strong reciprocators could invade a population of selfregarding types, and strong reciprocity is an evolutionary stable strategy. Although most of the evidence we report is based on behavioral experiments, the same behaviors are regularly described in everyday life, for example, in wage setting by firms, <b>tax</b> compliance, and <b>cooperation</b> in the protectio...|$|R
40|$|Frontiers {{provide an}} {{opportunity}} for one jurisdiction to remedy inequities (and even exploit them) in highway finance by employing toll-booths, and thereby ensuring the highest possible share of revenue from non-residents. If one jurisdiction sets policy in a vacuum, it is clearly advantageous to impose as high a toll on non-residents as can be supported. However, the neighboring jurisdiction can set policy in response. This establishes the potential for a classical prisoner’s dilemma consideration: in this case to tax (cooperate) or to toll (defect). Even if both jurisdictions would together raise as much revenue from taxes as from tolls (and perhaps more since taxes may have lower collection costs), the equilibrium solution in game theory, under a one-shot game, is for both parties to toll.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} two-country model of fiscal {{competition}} of Kanbur and Keen (1993) where countries differ {{in size and}} use a commodity tax to reach their objective of revenue maximization. Due to fiscal externalities, the non-cooperative outcome is inefficient.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine whether the international optimum can be reached and sustained by means of financial transfers between the countries as suggested in another context by Chander and Tulkens (1995, 1997). We show that with transfers of a specific form internationally optimal fiscal cooperation is indeed individually rational for both countries and, in that sense, sustainable. Furthermore, we show that these transfers can be such that the optimal outcome is, under some conditions, a dominant strategy for both countries.

In the literature such states are describes as "weak", "failing or failed", "collapsed", "conflict or post-conflict" - dependant on the extent of the particular state failure. Several indicators try to describe such states and partly allow for projections of the future development.
