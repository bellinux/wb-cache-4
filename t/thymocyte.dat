25|$|Tumours {{originating}} from the thymocytes are called thymic lymphomas. Lymphomas or leukemias of <b>thymocyte</b> origin {{are classified as}} Precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to proliferation, differentiation and T lineage commitment occurs within the DN <b>thymocyte</b> population. Commitment, {{or loss of}} alternative lineage potentials (such as myeloid, B, and NK lineage potentials), is dependent on Notch signaling, and is complete by the DN3 stage. Following T lineage commitment, DN3 thymocytes undergo β-selection.|$|E
25|$|Success in {{positive}} selection allows the <b>thymocyte</b> {{to undergo a}} number of maturational changes during {{the transition to a}} single positive T cell. The single positive T cells upregulate the chemokine receptor CCR7, causing migration from the cortex to the medulla. At this stage the key maturation process involves negative selection, the elimination of autoreactive thymocytes.|$|E
40|$|Two subpopulations (F 4 and F 6) of {{guinea-pig}} <b>thymocytes</b> {{were separated}} by using bovine serum albumin gradient centrifugation. The majority of F 4 <b>thymocytes</b> were weakly alkaline phosphatase (AP) positive cells, while most of F 6 <b>thymocytes</b> were strongly AP positive. The significant difference between their AP activities was confirmed biochemically. In the ultracytochemical study the majority of unfractionated and F 6 <b>thymocytes</b> were light and AP positive, whereas F 4 <b>thymocytes</b> were mostly dark, weakly AP positive cells. F 4 <b>thymocytes</b> responded well to PHA and Con A, while F 6 <b>thymocytes</b> {{failed to respond to}} these mitogens. The subpopulations did not differ in their homing properties. These findings indicate that strongly AP-positive cells are immature <b>thymocytes</b> and weakly AP-positive cells represent a more mature subpopulation of <b>thymocytes.</b> A hypothetical scheme for differentiation of guinea-pig <b>thymocytes</b> is presented...|$|R
40|$|Early in T-cell development, cells proceed through stages {{that are}} {{critically}} dependent on signaling through the Notch receptor. As cells mature, <b>thymocytes</b> transition from being Notch dependent to being Notch independent, but {{the stage of}} development during which this transition occurs is unknown. We used an in vitro differentiation system in which <b>thymocytes</b> can be cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of a Notch ligand to identify the stage of development in which <b>thymocytes</b> transition from being Notch responsive to Notch non-responsive. We identified the immature single-positive (ISP) CD 8 + stage of T-cell development as being this transition point. ISP <b>thymocytes</b> were responsive to Notch, but ISP cells responded to Notch ligation in a manner that was distinct from the response by double-negative (DN) <b>thymocytes.</b> Fewer ISP <b>thymocytes</b> proliferated and more ISP cells died in culture than DN <b>thymocytes.</b> Further, fewer double-positive (DP) <b>thymocytes</b> generated by culturing ISP <b>thymocytes</b> were in the S, G 2 or M phase of the cell cycle as compared with DP <b>thymocytes</b> derived from DN <b>thymocytes.</b> These data indicate that the DP population created varied depending on the input population. In summary, the data presented here indicate that ISP <b>thymocytes</b> responded to Notch differently than DN <b>thymocytes</b> and ISP <b>thymocytes</b> represent the transition stage from Notch-dependent survival and proliferation to Notch-independent survival and proliferation...|$|R
40|$|The bclx gene {{has been}} shown to {{regulate}} programmed cell death in vitro. We now show that Bclx expression increases dramatically when T cells differentiate from CD 4 - CD 8 - (double negative) <b>thymocytes</b> to CD 4 + CD 8 + [double positive (DP) ] <b>thymocytes.</b> In contrast single-positive (SP) <b>thymocytes</b> express negligible amounts of Bclx protein. This expression pattern contrasts with that of Bcl 2, which is present in double-negative <b>thymocytes,</b> down-regulated in DP <b>thymocytes,</b> and reinduced upon maturation to SP <b>thymocytes.</b> Elimination of Bclx by gene targeting dramatically shortens the survival of DP <b>thymocytes</b> but not the survival of SP <b>thymocytes</b> or peripheral SP T cells. These data suggest that the induction of Bclx during thymic maturation plays a critical role in regulating the length of time DP <b>thymocytes</b> survive in the absence of selection...|$|R
25|$|The {{ability of}} T cells to {{recognize}} foreign antigens is {{mediated by the}} T cell receptor (TCR), which is a surface protein able to recognize short protein sequences (peptides) that are presented on MHC. The purpose of <b>thymocyte</b> development is to produce mature T cells with a diverse array of functional T cell receptors, {{through the process of}} TCR gene rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|The cortex {{is mainly}} {{made up of}} thymocytes, {{supported}} by a network of finely-branched epithelial reticular cells, which is continuous with a similar network in the medulla. This network forms an adventitia to the blood vessels, which enter the cortex via septa near the junction with the medulla. The cortex is {{the location of the}} earliest events in <b>thymocyte</b> development, where T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and positive selection takes place.|$|E
25|$|Thymocytes are {{classified}} {{into a number}} of distinct maturational stages based on the expression of cell surface markers. The earliest <b>thymocyte</b> stage is the double negative stage (negative for both CD4 and CD8), which more recently has been better described as Lineage-negative, and which can be divided into four substages. The next major stage is the double positive stage (positive for both CD4 and CD8). The final stage in maturation is the single positive stage (positive for either CD4 or CD8).|$|E
40|$|A minor {{subpopulation}} {{of adult}} murine <b>thymocytes</b> (less than 5 %) that is Lyt- 2 -, L 3 T 4 -, and expresses {{low levels of}} Ly- 1 (designated dLy- 1 [dull] <b>thymocytes)</b> has been identified, isolated, and characterized. This study assesses the differentiation potential of dLy- 1 <b>thymocytes</b> in the thymus in vivo. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, radiation chimeras of C 57 BL/ 6 mice congenic at the Ly- 1 or Ly- 5 locus, and allelic markers to discriminate host and donor, we showed that transferred dLy- 1 cells were able to generate <b>thymocytes</b> expressing both cortical and medullary phenotypes in a sequential manner. The proportion of donor-derived <b>thymocytes</b> obtained was {{directly related to the}} number of dLy- 1 <b>thymocytes</b> transferred. Transfer of purified Lyt- 2 + or Lyt- 2 + + L 3 T 4 + <b>thymocytes,</b> which constitute greater than 94 % of total <b>thymocytes,</b> failed to generate any donor-derived <b>thymocytes</b> in irradiated recipients. Transfer of bone marrow (BM) cells produced the same sequential pattern of differentiation as that produced by dLy- 1 cells, but was delayed by 4 - 5 d. Transferred dLy- 1 <b>thymocytes</b> exhibited a limited capacity for self-renewal, and resulted in a single wave of differentiation in irradiated hosts. Thus, thymic repopulation by donor- derived cells after transfer of dLy- 1 <b>thymocytes</b> was transient, while repopulation by BM was permanent. These findings suggest that the isolated dLy- 1 <b>thymocytes</b> described herein are precursor <b>thymocytes</b> that represent a very early stage in intrathymic development...|$|R
40|$|Death by neglect {{requires}} that CD 4 (+) 8 (+) double-positive (DP) <b>thymocytes</b> avoid cytokine-mediated survival signals, which is presumably why DP <b>thymocytes</b> normally extinguish IL- 7 R gene expression. We report that DP <b>thymocytes</b> before positive selection (preselection DP <b>thymocytes)</b> fail to transduce IL- 7 signals {{even when they}} express high levels of transgenic IL- 7 R on their surface, because IL- 7 R signal transduction is actively suppressed in preselection DP <b>thymocytes</b> by suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) - 1. SOCS- 1 is highly expressed in preselection DP <b>thymocytes,</b> but it is down-regulated by T cell receptor mediated positive selection signals. Interestingly, {{we found that the}} uniquely small cell volume of DP <b>thymocytes</b> is largely the result of absent IL- 7 signaling in preselection DP <b>thymocytes.</b> We also report that, contrary to current concepts, preselection DP <b>thymocytes</b> express high levels of endogenously encoded IL- 4 Rs. However, their ability to transduce cytokine signals is similarly suppressed by SOCS- 1. Thus, despite high surface expression of transgenic or endogenous cytokine receptors, cytokine signal transduction is actively suppressed in preselection DP <b>thymocytes</b> until it is restored by positive selection...|$|R
40|$|Developing <b>thymocytes</b> are {{screened}} for self-reactivity before they exit the thymus, but how <b>thymocytes</b> scan the medulla for self antigens is unclear. Using two-photon microscopy, we observed that medullary <b>thymocytes</b> migrated rapidly and made frequent, transient contacts with dendritic cells. In {{the presence of}} a negative selecting ligand, <b>thymocytes</b> slowed, became confined to areas of approximately 30 mum in diameter and had increased contact with dendritic cells surrounding confinement zones. One third of polyclonal medullary <b>thymocytes</b> also showed confined, slower migration and may correspond to autoreactive <b>thymocytes.</b> Our data suggest that many autoreactive <b>thymocytes</b> do not undergo immediate arrest and death after encountering a negative selecting ligand but instead adopt an altered migration program while remaining in the medullary microenvironment...|$|R
25|$|Thy-1 or CD90 (Cluster of Differentiation 90) is a 25–37 kDa heavily N-glycosylated, glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) {{anchored}} conserved cell surface protein with {{a single}} V-like immunoglobulin domain, originally discovered as a <b>thymocyte</b> antigen. Thy-1 {{can be used as}} a marker for a variety of stem cells and for the axonal processes of mature neurons. Structural study of Thy-1 lead to the foundation of the Immunoglobulin superfamily, of which it is the smallest member, and led to some of the initial biochemical description and characterization of a vertebrate GPI anchor and also the first demonstration of tissue specific differential glycosylation.|$|E
25|$|Thymocytes which pass β-selection {{express a}} T cell {{receptor}} which {{is capable of}} assembling on the surface. However, many of these T cell receptors will still be non-functional, due to an inability to bind MHC. The next major stage of <b>thymocyte</b> development is positive selection, to keep only those thymocytes which have a T cell receptor capable of binding MHC. The T cell receptor requires CD8 as a coreceptor to bind to MHC class I, and CD4 as a coreceptor to bind MHC class II. At this stage thymocytes upregulate both CD4 and CD8, becoming double positive cells.|$|E
25|$|Common lymphoid {{precursor}} cells that {{migrate to the}} thymus become known as T-cell precursors (or thymocytes) and do not express a T cell receptor. Broadly speaking, the double negative (DN) stage is focused on producing a functional β-chain whereas the double positive (DP) stage is focused on producing a functional α-chain, ultimately producing a functional αβ T cell receptor. As the developing <b>thymocyte</b> progresses through the four DN stages (DN1, DN2, DN3, and DN4), the T cell expresses an invariant α-chain but rearranges the β-chain locus. If the rearranged β-chain successfully pairs with the invariant α-chain, signals are produced which cease rearrangement of the β-chain (and silence the alternate allele) and result in proliferation of the cell. Although these signals require this pre-TCR at the cell surface, they are independent of ligand binding to the pre-TCR. These thymocytes will then express both CD4 and CD8 and progresses to the double positive (DP) stage where selection of the α-chain takes place. If a rearranged β-chain {{does not lead to}} any signalling (e.g. {{as a result of an}} inability to pair with the invariant α-chain), the cell may die by neglect (lack of signalling).|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} and subcellular {{distribution of}} terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (DNA nucleotidylexotransferase; nucleosidetriphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidylexotransferase, EC 2. 7. 7. 31) in <b>thymocytes</b> and peripheral lymphocytes from rat, mouse, and calf was studied by immunofluorescence using rabbit antiserum to homogeneous transferase from calf. Terminal transferase was readily detected in approximately 75 % of cortical <b>thymocytes,</b> {{but not in}} medullary <b>thymocytes</b> or lymph node lymphocytes. The enzyme appeared to be present predominantly in the cytoplasm of positive <b>thymocytes</b> in ethanol-fixed cell smears and frozen sections. The reactivity of anti-terminal-transferase for <b>thymocytes</b> could be neutralized with purified calf enzyme. Results of experiments in which <b>thymocytes</b> were separated on 7 -step discontinuous Ficoll density gradients suggested that cortical <b>thymocytes</b> are heterogeneous with respect to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase content...|$|R
5000|$|Immature <b>thymocytes</b> each make {{distinct}} T-cell receptors by {{a process}} of gene rearrangement. This process is error-prone, and some <b>thymocytes</b> fail to make functional T-cell receptors, whereas other <b>thymocytes</b> make T-cell receptors that are autoreactive.|$|R
40|$|The {{circulation}} of rat <b>thymocytes</b> and factors which may control their pathway were studied. Evidence was obtained that intravenously infused <b>thymocytes</b> migrate from blood to spleen and lymph nodes {{in a manner}} similar to lymphocytes, though in lesser amounts. <b>Thymocytes,</b> incubated with neuraminidase prior to intravenous infusion, exhibit markedly altered cell migration. Enzyme-treated <b>thymocytes</b> concentrate in the liver with little accumulation in the spleen. Subsequently, however, small numbers of cells migrate to lymph nodes. Trypsin treatment does not alter the migratory pathway of <b>thymocytes.</b> The results suggest that <b>thymocytes</b> migrate from blood to peripheral lymphoid tissue and that sugar constituents may determine the circulatory pathway...|$|R
2500|$|As the thymus is {{the organ}} of T-cell development, any {{congenital}} defect in thymic genesis or a defect in <b>thymocyte</b> development {{can lead to}} a profound T cell deficiency in primary immunodeficiency disease. [...] Defects that affect both the T cell and B cell lymphocyte lineages result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). [...] Acquired T cell deficiencies can also affect <b>thymocyte</b> development in the thymus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability of}} T cells to {{recognize}} foreign antigens is {{mediated by the}} T-cell receptor. [...] The T-cell receptor undergoes genetic rearrangement during <b>thymocyte</b> maturation, resulting in each T cell bearing a unique T-cell receptor, specific to a limited set of peptide:MHC combinations. [...] The random nature of the genetic rearrangement results in a requirement of central tolerance mechanisms to remove or inactivate those T cells which bear a T-cell receptor {{with the ability to}} recognise self-peptides.|$|E
2500|$|The medulla is the {{location}} of the latter events in <b>thymocyte</b> development. [...] Thymocytes that reach the medulla have already successfully undergone T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and positive selection, and have been exposed to a limited degree of negative selection. [...] The medulla is specialized to allow thymocytes to undergo additional rounds of negative selection to remove auto-reactive T cells from the mature repertoire. Transcriptional regulators AIRE and FEZ2 are expressed by the thymic medullary epithelium, and drives the transcription of organ-specific genes such as insulin to allow maturing thymocytes to be exposed to a more complex set of self-antigens than is present in the cortex.|$|E
40|$|Clonal {{deletion}} of <b>thymocytes</b> bearing TCR {{for self}} antigens is one major mechanism of T cell tolerance induction. Peptide antigen-induced deletion of <b>thymocytes</b> from a/ 3 TCR transgenic mice {{has been studied}} using single cell suspension cultures. The results show that antigen-presenting immature CD 4 +CD 8 + <b>thymocytes</b> can tolerize antigen-reactive immature <b>thymocytes</b> in vitro by programmed cell death (apoptosis) 6 - 8 h after antigen exposure. Antigen-induced apoptosis of immature <b>thymocytes</b> was inhibited by antibodies specific for the a/ 3 TCR, CD 3, CD 8, and LFA- 1 molecules. This implies that clonal elimination of self-reactive CD 4 +CD 8 + <b>thymocytes</b> {{does not depend on}} specialized deleting cell types in the thymus and occurs whenever the TCR of immature <b>thymocytes</b> bind antigen fragments presented by MHC molecules...|$|R
40|$|<b>Thymocytes</b> responded well to PHA {{in terms}} of [3 H]-TdR {{incorporation}} if they were precultured {{in the presence of}} LPS, whereas fresh <b>thymocytes</b> or <b>thymocytes</b> pre-cultured in the absence of LPS responded poorly to PHA. The PHA response of <b>thymocytes</b> pre-cultured with LPS for several hours was similar to that of fresh spleen cells in the kinetics and dose-response profiles. The effect of LPS was found on <b>thymocytes</b> from BALB/c. Cr, AKR/Jms, and DDD/ 1 mice, but was not observed on those from C 3 H/HeJms and C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice, indicating that there is a strain difference in the PHA responsiveness of LPS-pre-cultured <b>thymocytes.</b> In contrast to <b>thymocytes,</b> the response of spleen cells to PHA was enhanced in both C 57 Bl/ 6 J and BALB/c. Cr mice by pre-culture with LPS...|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} that {{recombinant}} or natural interleukin 4 (IL- 4) (formerly called B-cell stimulatory factor 1) induces proliferation of activated adult or fetal <b>thymocytes.</b> In the case of adult <b>thymocytes,</b> IL- 4 in combination with Con A or phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) stimulated the proliferation of peanut agglutinin (PNA) -negative (-) <b>thymocytes,</b> while PNA-positive (+) <b>thymocytes</b> showed only marginal responses. Further investigation revealed that day 14 - 17 fetal <b>thymocytes,</b> purified L 3 T 4 - LyT 2 - double-negative adult <b>thymocytes,</b> and single positive L 3 T 4 + LyT 2 - or L 3 T 4 - LyT 2 + <b>thymocytes</b> {{failed to respond to}} IL- 4 or PMA alone but proliferated strongly with both IL- 4 and PMA. In contrast, purified double-positive L 3 T 4 + LyT 2 + adult <b>thymocytes</b> showed only a marginal proliferative response to these stimuli. Responsiveness of thymic subpopulations to PMA and IL- 4 could be inhibited with anti-IL- 4 but not with anti-IL- 2 monoclonal antibodies, indicating that they were IL- 2 independent. Finally, we have observed that supernatants from calcium ionophore and PMA-stimulated adult double-negative L 3 T 4 - LyT 2 - <b>thymocytes</b> induce proliferation of double-negative adult <b>thymocytes.</b> This latter response is inhibited by anti-IL- 4 monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that under appropriate stimulation conditions, these immature <b>thymocytes</b> are able to produce IL- 4. These observations suggest a role for IL- 4 in T-cell ontogeny...|$|R
2500|$|Animals {{that eat}} PCB-{{contaminated}} food even {{for short periods}} of time suffer liver damage and may die. In 1968 in Japan, 400,000 birds died after eating poultry feed that was contaminated with PCBs.

[...] Other effects of PCBs in animals include changes in the immune system, behavioral alterations, and impaired reproduction. PCBs that have dioxin-like activity are known to cause a variety of teratogenic effects in animals. Exposure to PCBs causes hearing loss and symptoms similar to hypothyroidism in rats.|$|E
2500|$|The antigen Thy-1 was {{the first}} T cell marker [...] to be identified. Thy-1 was {{discovered}} [...] by Reif and Allen in 1964 during a search for heterologous antisera against mouse leukemia cells, and was demonstrated by them to be present on murine thymocytes, on T lymphocytes, and on neuronal cells. [...] It was originally named theta (θ) antigen, then Thy-1 (<b>THYmocyte</b> differentiation antigen 1) due to its prior identification in thymocytes (precursors of T cells in the thymus). The human homolog was isolated in 1980 as a 25kDa protein (p25) of T-lymphoblastoid cell line MOLT-3 binding with anti-monkey-thymocyte antisera. The discovery of Thy-1 in mice and humans led to the subsequent discovery of many other T cell markers, which is very significant {{to the field of}} immunology since T cells (along with B cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.|$|E

25|$|Lymphoid tissue Thy-1 {{expression}} is highly variable between species. In humans, Thy-1 {{expression is}} restricted to only a small population of cortical <b>thymocytes</b> and not expressed in mature human T cells. It {{is probably the most}} abundant glycoprotein of murine <b>thymocytes,</b> with about One million copies per cell covering up to 10–20% of the cell surface. Mouse cortical <b>thymocytes</b> express higher levels of Thy-1 than medullary <b>thymocytes</b> which in turn express more than lymph node cells (~200,000 copies/cell). A similar inverse developmental temporal expression profile is seen in rats T cells, although rat Thy-1 is lost at an earlier stage of T cell maturation. Thy-1 is only expressed on <b>thymocytes</b> in rats (contrast to <b>thymocytes</b> and splenocytes in mice). The third intron of the mouse Thy-1 gene has a 36 base pair region that recruits nuclear transcription factors, such as Ets-1-like NF, expressed in <b>thymocytes</b> and splenocytes. The homologous region of the rat gene lacks the Ets-1-like NF binding site, but instead binds another NF expressed in rat <b>thymocytes</b> but not splenocytes.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} the {{technique}} of in situ hybridization to investigate the expression of lymphokine genes by immature <b>thymocytes</b> during intrathymic development. In 13 -day fetal <b>thymocytes</b> a population of cells constitutively produces low levels of interleukin 2 (IL- 2) and interleukin 4 (IL- 4) mRNAs.

By contrast, the population of IL- 2 receptor mRNA-producing <b>thymocytes</b> increases progressively up to 15 days of gestation, and expression thereafter decreases up to birth.

40|$|<b>Thymocytes</b> expressing self-reactive T-cell receptors (TCR) are {{eliminated}} in the thymus through a TCR-mediated signal.

In this study, we investigated the localization {{and function of}} caspase-activated DNAse (CAD) and its inhibitor (ICAD) in <b>thymocytes</b> prior to or after in vivo TCR stimulation. We showed that CAD and ICAD are co-localized in microsome, nuclei and cytosol in unstimulated <b>thymocytes.</b> Following in vivo TCR engagement, ICAD located in cytosol and microsome was degraded and the resulting activated CAD induced chromosomal DNA fragmentation.
