50|$|Consistently {{good but}} never overpowering hitters, Hurst was a {{specialist}} at changing speeds. His fastball was hard enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> right-handed hitters, and he mixed {{it with an}} excellent curve and a slider as well. He also had a decent forkball at times. Thanks to his great control, Hurst was able to work corners well and had a profuse knowledge of each hitter. In seven post-season games he had 3-2 with 37 strikeouts and a 2.29 ERA.|$|R
60|$|We {{returned}} to Middelburg by {{an entirely different}} route from that by which we came. Leaving {{the valley of the}} Olifants to our right, we trekked along the high-veldt, and thus avoided all the fever country. Roughly speaking, we had about 120 miles of country to get over to reach Middelburg, and we determined to do this in three days and two nights, so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saturday night, as we were much pressed for time. Now, according to English ideas, it is no great thing to travel 120 miles in three days; but it is six days' journey in an ox-waggon over bad country, {{and we were going to}} do it in half that time by doubling the speed.|$|E

This region of the six counties alone will some day support a population of millions.

50|$|Players {{throw the}} washers <b>in</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in,</b> <b>on</b> or near <b>to</b> the box {{or in the}} pipe. When throwing, the player may stride forward of {{the front of the}} box or remain entirely in back of the box, but at least one foot must remain behind the front of the box. (The front is the side facing the opponent.) In other words, players may stand next to the box and stride past it with one foot. In the {{traditional}} four-player game, players throw two washers each, throwing both before the opponent throws their two. A player may throw both washers at once, but this may decrease accuracy. The style of throw is dependent only upon player preference, and the scoring team throws first in the next round.|$|R

The McGurk's Bar bombing was the catalyst that sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalist and republican paramilitaries that would help make the 1970s the bloodiest decade in the 30-year history of the Troubles.|$|R
