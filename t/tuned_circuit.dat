25|$|The antenna is an {{integral}} part of the <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> and its reactance contributes to determining the circuit's resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a capacitance, as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have capacitive reactance. Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor, and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the wire antenna (in addition to significant parasitic capacitance in the coil) to form the <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> with the coil.|$|E
25|$|Many FM {{detector}} circuits exist. A common {{method for}} recovering the information signal {{is through a}} Foster-Seeley discriminator. A phase-locked loop {{can be used as}} an FM demodulator. Slope detection demodulates an FM signal by using a <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier. As the frequency rises and falls the <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> provides a changing amplitude of response, converting FM to AM. AM receivers may detect some FM transmissions by this means, although it does not provide an efficient means of detection for FM broadcasts.|$|E

It can efficiently reduce the deviations in the 3 dB bandwidth from the variations of PVT (Process, Voltage and Temperature). The design of the STC circuit is simpler than VCF and it has less chip area. The chip has been implanted using TCMC 0. 35 μm CMOS technology and the power consumption is less than 9. 05 mW...|$|R
25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit,</b> the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{engineering}} {{involves the}} design and testing of electronic circuits that use the properties of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors to achieve a particular functionality.

Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.|$|E
25|$|Single {{resonant}} {{solid state}} Tesla coil (SRSSTC) - In this circuit the primary {{does not have}} a capacitor and so is not a tuned circuit; only the secondary is.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a low-noise 850 GHz superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) quasi-particle mixer with NbTiN thin-film microstrip <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits</b> and hybrid Nb/AlN/NbTiN tunnel junctions.

This mixer outperforms current Nb SIS mixers {{by a factor of}} nearly 2 near 800 GHz. The high gap frequency and low loss at 800 GHz make NbTiN an attractive material with which to fabricate <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits</b> for SIS mixers.

25|$|The supply {{transformer}} (T) {{secondary winding}} is connected across the primary <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit.</b> It might {{seem that the}} transformer would be a leakage path for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large inductance gives it a very high impedance at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current. If the supply transformer has inadequate leakage inductance, radio frequency chokes are placed in its secondary leads to block the RF current.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of crystal sets {{is that they}} are vulnerable to interference from stations near in frequency to the desired station; that is to say, they have low selectivity. Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a large bandwidth (low Q factor) compared to modern receivers.|$|E
25|$|Reducing the {{coupling}} between the coils, by physically separating {{them so that}} less of the magnetic field of one intersects the other, reduces the mutual inductance, narrows the bandwidth, and results in much sharper, more selective tuning than that produced by a single <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit.</b> However, the looser coupling also reduced {{the power of the}} signal passed to the second circuit. The transformer was made with adjustable coupling, to allow the listener to experiment with various settings to gain the best reception.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacitance}} of superconducting tunnel junctions can seriously {{degrade the}} performance of quasiparticle (SIS) mixers operating in the submillimeter band, so {{it is essential to}} provide a <b>circuit</b> for <b>tuning</b> out this capacitance at the operating frequency. In this article, we present two new <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits</b> for SIS mixers which use a pair of SIS junctions connected by an inductance. Compared to previously proposed <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits,</b> ours have a broader bandwidth, are easier to scale to higher frequencies, and may be easier to fabricate. We have constructed quasi-optical mixers which employ these <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits,</b> using Nb/Al-Oxide/Nb SIS junctions defined by optical lithography. The performance of these devices is excellent, giving receiver noise temperatures of 113 K (DSB) at 490 GHz and 230 K DSB at 612 GHz. In addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of our <b>tuning</b> <b>circuit,</b> these results show that quasi-optical mixers can be competitive with or superior to waveguide mixers at submillimeter wavelengths. The mixers continue to perform well at frequencies up to 672 GHz, which is about 95 % of the Nb gap frequency...|$|R
25|$|Continuous wave - In {{these the}} {{transformer}} {{is driven by}} a feedback oscillator, which applies a sinusoidal current to the transformer. The primary <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> serves as the tank circuit of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous sine wave output. Power vacuum tubes are often used as active devices instead of transistors {{because they are more}} robust and tolerant of overloads. In general, continuous excitation produces lower output voltages from a given input power than pulsed excitation.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} crystal receivers did {{not have}} a <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> at all, and just consisted of a crystal detector connected between the antenna and ground, with an earphone across it. Since this circuit lacked any frequency-selective elements besides the broad resonance of the antenna, it had little ability to reject unwanted stations, so all stations within a wide band of frequencies were heard in the earphone (in practice the most powerful usually drowns out the others). It was used in the earliest days of radio, when only one or two stations were within a crystal set's limited range.|$|E
25|$|All {{circuits}} have, in practice, some inductance, {{which may}} have beneficial or detrimental effects. For a <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit,</b> inductance is used to provide a frequency-selective circuit. Practical inductors {{may be used to}} provide filtering, or energy storage, in a given network. The inductance per unit length of a transmission line is one of the properties that determines its characteristic impedance; balancing the inductance and capacitance of cables is important for distortion-free telegraphy and telephony. The inductance of long AC power transmission lines affects the power capacity of the line. Sensitive circuits, such as microphone and computer network cables, may utilize special cabling construction, limiting the inductive coupling between circuits.|$|E
40|$|Minimization {{of power}} {{loss in the}} <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits</b> of frequency-tunable small {{resonant}} antennas, such as microstrip patches, is studied. First, the frequency shift and the associated power loss in certain <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits</b> are theoretically calculated based on approximate circuit models of fairly narrow-band resonant antennas. By investigating the ratio of frequency shift and loss, an optimal configuration for the <b>tuning</b> <b>circuit</b> can be determined.

40|$|Waveguide SIS mixers are {{presented}} in which Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions are integrated with both NbTiN/SiO 2 /NbTiN and NbTiN/SiO 2 /Al <b>tuning</b> <b>circuits.</b> The mixers with a NbTiN/SiO 2 /NbTiN <b>tuning</b> <b>circuit</b> yield relatively low receiver noise temperatures between 700 and 830 GHz, but their sensitivity drops significantly above ~ 850 GHz. In contrast, low-noise heterodyne mixing near 1 THz is observed in mixers incorporating a NbTiN/SiO 2 /Al <b>tuning</b> <b>circuit.</b> In particular, an uncorrected receiver noise temperature of 585 K is measured at 970 GHz.

A decrease in receiver sensitivity above 1 THz is attributed to an onset of rf loss in the NbTiN. 1...|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} principle used {{in crystal}} radio design to transfer maximum {{power to the}} earphone is impedance matching. The maximum power is transferred {{from one part of}} a circuit to another when the impedance of one circuit is the complex conjugate of that of the other; this implies that the two circuits should have equal resistance. However, in crystal sets, the impedance of the antenna-ground system (around 10-200 ohms) is usually lower than the impedance of the receiver's <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> (thousands of ohms at resonance), and also varies depending {{on the quality of the}} ground attachment, length of the antenna, and the frequency to which the receiver is tuned.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the IF center {{frequency}} fIF is {{chosen to be}} less than the desired reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier and less expensive to get high selectivity at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher {{center frequency}} will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier and less expensive to get high gain at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it would need only two stages with an IF at 1MHz but four stages at 10MHz.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit),</b> storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E

5000|$|The {{name comes}} from blocking—"choking"—high {{frequencies}} while passing low frequencies. It is a functional name; the name [...] "choke" [...] is used if an inductor is used for blocking or decoupling higher frequencies, but is simply called an [...] "inductor" [...] if used in electronic filters or <b>tuned</b> <b>circuits.</b> Inductors designed for use as chokes are usually distinguished by not having the low-loss construction (high Q factor) required in inductors used in <b>tuned</b> <b>circuits</b> and filtering applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{major problem}} with the TRF receiver, {{particularly}} as a consumer product, was its complicated tuning. All the <b>tuned</b> <b>circuits</b> need to track to keep the narrow bandwidth tuning. Keeping multiple <b>tuned</b> <b>circuits</b> aligned while <b>tuning</b> over a wide frequency range is difficult. In the early TRF sets the operator had to perform that task, as described above. A superheterodyne receiver only needs to track the RF and LO stages; the onerous selectivity requirements are confined to the IF amplifier which is fixed-tuned.|$|R
500|$|A double-tuned {{amplifier}} is a {{tuned amplifier}} with transformer coupling between the amplifier stages {{in which the}} inductances of both the primary and secondary windings are tuned separately with a capacitor across each. [...] The scheme results in a wider bandwidth and steeper skirts than a single <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> would achieve.|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.|$|E
