40|$|The {{capacity}} of visual working memory (VWM) {{refers to the}} amount of visual information that can be maintained in mind at once, readily accessible for ongoing tasks. In healthy young adults, the capacity limit of VWM corresponds to about three simple objects. While some researchers argued <b>that</b> VWM <b>capacity</b> becomes adult-like in early years of life, others claimed <b>that</b> the <b>capacity</b> of VWM continues to develop beyond middle childhood. Here we assessed whether VWM capacity reaches adult levels in adolescence. Using an adaptation of the visual change detection task, we measured visual working memory capacity estimates in 13 year-olds, 16 -year-olds, and young adults. We tested whether the capacity estimates observed in early or later years of adolescence were comparable to the estimates obtained from adults. Our results demonstrated <b>that</b> the <b>capacity</b> of VWM continues to develop throughout adolescence, not reaching adult levels even in 16 year-olds. These findings suggest <b>that</b> VWM <b>capacity</b> displays a prolonged development, similar to the protracted trajectories observed in various other aspects of cognition...|$|R
