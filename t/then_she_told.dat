Then she had her men remove the tent, and she threw the rope over a bough. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> her men to pull the rope and they hanged Agne avenging Skjalf's father. Skjalf and her men ran to the ships and escaped to Finland, leaving her sons behind.|$|E
2500|$|King Augustus III of Poland died in 1763, so Poland {{needed to}} elect a new ruler. Catherine {{supported}} Poniatowski as a candidate {{to become the next}} king. [...] She sent the Russian army into Poland to avoid possible disputes. Russia invaded Poland on 26 August 1764, threatening to fight, and imposing Poniatowski as king. Poniatowski accepted the throne, and thereby put himself under Catherine's control. News of Catherine's plan spread and Frederick II (others say the Ottoman sultan) warned her that if she tried to conquer Poland by marrying Poniatowski, all of Europe would oppose her. [...] She had no intention of marrying him, having already given birth to Orlov's child and to the Grand Duke Paul by <b>then.</b> <b>She</b> <b>told</b> Poniatowski to marry someone else to remove all suspicion. Poniatowski refused.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "it all {{happened}} before my time--long before. I never knew her." [...] And <b>then</b> presently <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me the story.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Jack the {{proposal}} {{that had been}} made to her.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew that}} one {{had made her}} thrall, A thrall to him, alas for me; And <b>then,</b> at last, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me all, And {{wondered}} what her end would be.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him, whilst he {{sat there}} hunched and shuddering.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him {{the strange}} {{story of the}} little lost prince of England.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> {{how she was}} balked and {{interrupted}} at Vaucouleurs, {{but finally}} got her soldiers, and began her march.|$|E
60|$|To {{complete}} the favourable impression, <b>she</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{tried to}} hold up after that; and many a time, when they <b>told</b> her <b>she</b> was thoughtless and light-hearted, made believe to be so; {{but it was all}} a bygone <b>then.</b> <b>She</b> never <b>told</b> her husband what <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> me--she was afraid of saying it to anybody else--till one night, {{a little more than a}} week before it happened, when she said to him: [...] "My dear, I think I am dying." ...|$|R
60|$|The other <b>then</b> said <b>she</b> {{had heard}} of her {{and that she was}} nursing her child, and <b>she</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Martha to go to the mansion that {{afternoon}} as she had something to say to her.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him all--told him {{the truth}} word by word, without {{attempting}} to shield herself or condone her error.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her vacantly. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him all that she had done that day and the places to which she had been.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him how she {{had been}} {{dropping}} cedar berries and bits of cedar leaves along the bare and stony course they had traversed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, of course," [...] said Mary. [...] "What d'you take me for?--a Cockney like you?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> him {{exactly where}} the north lay, and where the south.|$|R
6000|$|... "This lady {{immediately}} began to ask me questions. She had perceived that I was a stranger, {{and she wanted to}} know where I came from, what was my business, and as much as I could tell her of myself. 'I knew you were a scholar,' she said, 'because of your book, and I believe in scholars.' <b>Then</b> briefly <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me her story and what she wanted of me.|$|R
6000|$|Yet {{perhaps even}} <b>then</b> <b>she</b> would have <b>told</b> all, but that, after having bound over Kalliope to secrecy, {{it would be}} awkward to confess that <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> all. It would be like owning herself in the wrong, and for {{that she was not}} prepared. Besides, where would be the secrecy of her 'great thing'? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him of Judkins's return, of {{the driving}} of the red herd, of Venters's {{departure}} on Wrangle, and the calling-in of her riders.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> the Queen all {{the story}} of their adventures, and of how they had been carried by {{accident}} into the Valleys of Merryland.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--your sister. And I am {{sure she}} disapproves it. She {{did not say}} so; but I am sure it is so. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me something." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> the Princess {{that she}} had asked about her hus-band, but that her son had replied that {{he knew nothing about}} him, and that her only hope was to go and inquire of the Wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said briefly. [...] "I met her accidentally {{about two}} months ago and as accidentally {{found out that she}} had taken an {{interest}} in {{one of the first things}} I ever wrote for your paper. She neither knew you nor me. It was <b>then</b> that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me this story; she did not even then know who I was, though she had met some of my family. She was very good and has generously tried to help me." ...|$|R
60|$|She hesitated, so the Sultan {{sent away}} {{all but the}} vizir, and bade her speak freely, {{promising}} to forgive her beforehand for anything she might say. <b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> him of her son's violent love for the princess.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Laura paused {{before she}} answered; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> the whole story. [...] "He is violently in love, {{and the girl}} he loves has refused him twice." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him of {{her vision}} {{by the pool}} and all that {{happened}} after it. When she had finished Richard could only shake his head and say: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{were too}} ill, uncle, and Rose {{did not know}} about it till she came home. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Herbert, and he hoped to find him and write.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> her rosary with devout fervour, and {{retiring}} from the chapel to her own apartment, summoned her women to adjust her dress, and remove the external appearance of the violence to which {{she had been so}} lately subjected.|$|R
5000|$|Halperin {{returned}} to vaudeville {{in the later}} 1920s.She also regularly spoke and sang on radio, where she enacted famous historical women from Lucrezia Borgia to Martha Washington.In June 1932 Haplerin was headliner at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.By <b>then,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> the Los Angeles Examiner, vaudeville performers had to [...] "compete with the greatest stars in the world, through talking motion pictures."She continued to play her routines in movie theaters between features in the 1930s.She ended her professional stage career in 1934.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{discovering}} she {{had been}} tricked, Tấm sobbed until a fairy guardian appeared to her and comforted her. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> Tấm to look into her basket to discover the one remaining little goby. <b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Tấm to take the fish home {{and put it into}} the well {{at the back of the}} house, reciting a special poem/greeting whenever she came to feed it, which meant: ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him the {{sad story}} of her life, as a heroine must do, sooner or later, either to a {{theatrical}} manager or to a reporter.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are so dear," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{must tell}} you a great thing." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> {{the story of the}} two men in the barouche.|$|E
6000|$|Before she answered, muttering [...] "After the mistress, the maid," [...] Nehushta {{swallowed}} a deep {{draught of water}} in her turn, which, indeed, she needed sorely. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> her all.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{the true}} bride was freed. The King <b>then</b> awoke, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him {{all that had}} taken place, and how her step-mother and step-sister had betrayed her. Then the brother was at once {{taken out of the}} snake-pit--the snakes had never touched him--and the step-mother and step-sister were flung down into it instead of him.|$|R
60|$|Joe made a {{movement}} to rise with her, when she muttered indistinctly as if speaking to some one. He remembered <b>then</b> <b>she</b> had once <b>told</b> him that <b>she</b> talked in her sleep, and how greatly it annoyed her. He might hear something more with which to tease her; so he listened.|$|R
60|$|FALDER. [Turning to the jury] I {{was having}} my breakfast when she came. Her dress was all torn, {{and she was}} gasping and couldn't seem to get her breath at all; there were the marks of his fingers round her throat; her arm was bruised, and the blood had got into her eyes dreadfully. It frightened me, and <b>then</b> when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me, I felt--I felt--well--it {{was too much for}} me! [Hardening suddenly] If you'd seen it, having the {{feelings}} for her that I had, you'd have felt the same, I know.|$|R
