5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{incorporated}} by charter of Edward IV (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586, 1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation as a borough constituency began in 1295 and continued until the Reform Act of 1870, {{when the original}} borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. From 4 July 1870 the town {{was incorporated}} within the county constituency of West Somerset. When Parliamentary seats were redistributed for the 1885 general election, a new county division of Bridgwater was created. A variety of markets were granted to the town during the Middle Ages including a Midsummer fair (on 24 June), one {{at the beginning of}} Lent was added in 1468, and one at Michaelmas. <b>The</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> markets and fairs for the sale of wool and wine, and later of cloth, declined after medieval times. The shipping trade of the port revived after the construction of the new dock in 1841, and corn and timber have been imported for centuries.|$|E

5|$|In metabolism, {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide {{is involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then {{be used as a}} reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway. This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient {{than it would be}} if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The French had {{recognised}} <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> islands as {{bases for}} raiding warships during the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1801), but by late 1807 the only naval resources {{allocated to the}} region were a few older frigates {{and a large number}} of local privateers. Following the reduction of these remaining naval forces on Isle de France during 1808, by defeat in battle and disarmaments due to age and unseaworthiness, the French naval authorities made a serious attempt to disrupt British trade in the region, ordering five large modern frigates to sail to Isle de France under Commodore Jacques Hamelin. Four of these ships broke through the British blockade of the French coast, arriving in the Indian Ocean in the spring of 1809, where Hamelin dispersed them into the Bay of Bengal with orders to intercept, attack and capture or destroy the heavily armed but extremely valuable convoys of East Indiamen. The first French success came {{at the end of the}} spring, when the frigate Caroline successfully attacked a convoy at the Action of 31 May 1809, seizing two heavily laden merchant ships.|$|E

5|$|In the Highlands and Islands, the longship was {{gradually}} succeeded by (in ascending order of size) the birlinn, highland galley and lymphad, which, were clinker-built ships, usually with a centrally-stepped mast, {{but also with}} oars {{that allowed them to}} be rowed. Like the longship, they had a high stem and stern, and were still small and light enough to be dragged across portages, but they replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century. They could fight at sea, but rarely were able to match armed ships of the Scottish or English navies. However, they could usually outrun larger vessels and were extremely useful in quick raids and in aiding escape. Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands, which have been argued to date back to the muster system of Dál Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers. Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to feudal obligations, with Celtic-Scandinavian lords, who had previously contributed {{as a result of a}} general levy on landholding, coming to hold their lands in exchange for specified numbers and sizes of ships supplied to the king. This process probably began in the thirteenth century, but would be intensified under Robert I. <b>The</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> ships was underlined by their becoming common in depictions on grave markers and in heraldry throughout the Highlands and Islands.|$|E

25|$|In 1828 Berlioz heard Beethoven's {{third and}} fifth symphonies {{performed}} at the Paris Conservatoire– an experience that he found overwhelming.

The previous exam was mainly concerned with literature, not with politics or history. The king himself ordered the system to be reformed by increasing <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> other subjects. He also restored the reputations of executed scholars such as Jo Gwang-jo, who died in Third Literati Purge of 1519, and denounced the accomplishments of corrupt aristocrats, notably Nam Gon, who instigated the purge under Jungjong and contributed greatly to {{the corruption of the}} era. These acts earned the king the respect of the general populace, and the country enjoyed a brief era of peace.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{findings}} {{is that they}} contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact {{in an attempt to}} avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that emotions were negligible. Feeding was thought {{to be the most important}} factor in the formation of a mother–child bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the mother–child bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of love. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either mother or father. Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} supporting <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> texts discussing hells lies in Buddhists' further {{investigation of the}} nature of hell and its denizens. Buddhavarman's fifth century Chinese translation of the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra (Ch. āpídámó pípóshā lùn 阿毘曇毘婆沙論) questions whether hell wardens who torture hell beings are themselves sentient beings, what form they take, and what language they speak. Xuanzang's 玄奘 seventh century Chinese translation of the Abhidharmakośa śāstra (Ch. āpídámó jùshè lùn 阿毘達磨倶舍論) too is concerned with whether hell wardens are sentient beings, as well as how they go on to receive karmic retribution, whether they create bad karma at all, and why are they not physically affected and burned by the fires of hell.|$|E
