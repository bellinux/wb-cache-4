40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe primary {{objective of this}} thesis was to analyze the suitability {{for use of the}} Award Fee <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contracts</b> in the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The researcher used the Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair award fee monitoring organization as a sample for comparison with the Israeli Ministry of Defense organization. The purpose for this comparison was to determine if there was an organization structure barrier that would prevent implementation of the Award Fee <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contracts.</b> Other barriers were identified and discussed {{through the use of a}} written survey conducted with key personnel within the Israeli Ministry of Defense. A guide was developed for use when implementing the Award Fee <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contracts.</b> The analysis revealed that there were no barriers that could not be overcome and that the benefits to be gained by incorporating the Award Fee <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contracts</b> far outweigh any impediments. It was recommended that the Israeli Ministry of Defense consider incorporating these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> into their procurement regulations after evaluating the results of a test case.

25|$|Between 1988 and 1990 SF Line took {{delivery}} of three new ships (MS Amorella, MS Isabella and MS Cinderella) while Slite took {{delivery of}} two (MS Athena and MS Kalypso). Unfortunately Wärtsilä Marine, the shipyard building one of SF Line's newbuilds {{and both of}} Slite's, went bankrupt in 1989. SF Line avoided financial repercussions, their Cinderella had been continuously paid for as her construction progressed. Hence it was SF Line who owned the almost completed ship when the shipyard went bankrupt. Slite however had signed a more traditional <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> the Kalypso was {{to be paid for}} on delivery. Since the shipyard owned the unfinished ship, this led to an increased cost for the Kalypso—about 200 million SEK more than had been originally envisaged. In the end, despite the financial problems, by 1990 Viking Line had the largest and newest cruiseferry fleet in the world.|$|E
25|$|Contract law {{works best}} when an {{agreement}} is performed, and recourse {{to the courts}} is never needed because each party knows her rights and duties. However, where an unforeseen event renders an agreement very hard, or even impossible to perform, the courts typically will construe the parties to want to have released themselves from their obligations. It may also be that one party simply breaches a contract's terms. If a contract is not substantially performed, then the innocent party is entitled to cease her own performance and sue for damages {{to put her in}} the position as if the contract were performed. She is under a duty to mitigate her losses and cannot claim for harm that was a remote consequence of the contractual breach, but remedies in English law are footed on the principle that full compensation for all losses, pecuniary or not, should be made good. In exceptional circumstances, the law goes further to require a wrongdoer to make restitution for their gains from breaching a contract, and may demand specific performance of the agreement rather than monetary compensation. It is also possible that a contract becomes voidable, because, depending on the specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> one party failed to make adequate disclosure or they made misrepresentations during negotiations.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 September 2005 Paris Match {{published}} {{an interview in}} which she declared that she was considering running for the presidency in 2007. In 2006 the CPE (first employment contract) laws were proposed with large protests as a result. Rather than going to the organised protest, she voted a law in her [...] "région" [...] whereby no company using that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> would receive the Région's subsidies. The government backed down and stated that the law would {{be put on the}} statute book, but {{that it would not be}} applied. After this event Royal was tipped as the lead contender in what is dubbed the [...] "Sarko-Ségo" [...] race against Nicolas Sarkozy. Until that time, she had not been thought a likely candidate as she had stayed out of the Socialist Party's power struggles.|$|E
2500|$|In {{specific}} contracts, such {{as those}} for sales of goods, between a landlord and tenant, or in employment, the courts imply standardised contractual terms (or terms [...] "implied in law"). Such terms set out a menu of [...] "default rules" [...] that generally apply in absence of true agreement to the contrary. In one instance of partial codification, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 summed up all the standard contractual provisions in typical commercial sales agreements developed by the common law. This is now updated in the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and in default of people agreeing something different in general its terms will apply. For instance, under section 12-14, any contract for sale of goods carries the implied terms that the seller has legal title, that it will match prior descriptions {{and that it is}} of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. Similarly the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 section 13 says services must be performed with reasonable care and skill. As a matter of common law the test is what terms are a [...] "necessary incident" [...] to the specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> in question. This test derives from Liverpool City Council v Irwin where the House of Lords held that, although fulfilled on the facts of the case, a landlord owes a duty to tenants in a block of flats to keep the common parts in reasonable repair. In employment contracts, multiple standardised implied terms arise also, even before statute comes into play, for instance to give employees adequate information to make a judgment about how to take advantage of their pension entitlements. The primary standardised employment term is that both employer and worker owe one another an obligation of [...] "mutual trust and confidence". Mutual trust and confidence can be undermined in multiple ways, primarily where an employer's repulsive conduct means a worker can treat herself as being constructively dismissed. In Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA the House of Lords held the duty was breached by the employer running the business as a cover for numerous illegal activities. The House of Lords has repeated that the term may always be excluded, but this has been disputed because unlike a contract for goods or services among commercial parties, an employment relation is characterised by unequal bargaining power between employer and worker. In Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority the Court of Appeal all held that a junior doctor could not be made to work at an average of 88 hours a week, even though this was an express term of his contract, where it would damage his health. However, one judge said that result followed from application of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, one judge said it was because at common law express terms could be construed in the light of implied terms, and one judge said implied terms may override express terms. Even in employment, or in consumer affairs, English courts remain divided {{about the extent to which}} they should depart from the basic paradigm of contractual freedom, that is, in absence of legislation.|$|E
