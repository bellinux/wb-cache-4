However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.|$|E

The groups are then recited. Groups are usually either four or five digits or radio-alphabet letters. The groups are typically repeated, either by reading each group twice or by repeating the entire message as a whole.|$|E

Foley's office confirmed that Foley had sent the messages but said it has a practice of asking for photos of individuals who may ask for recommendations and that the page had requested a recommendation.|$|E

This way, the teletext decoder captures every page sent out and stores it in memory, so when a page is requested by the user it can be loaded directly from memory {{instead of having to}} wait for <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> be transmitted. When the page is transmitted again, the television checks if the page in memory is still up-to-date and updates it if necessary.|$|E

Opera Mini 4 includes {{the ability to}} view web pages similarly to a desktop based browser by introducing Overview and Zoom functions, and a landscape view setting. In Overview mode, the user can scroll a zoomed-out version of certain web pages. Using a built-in pointer, the user can zoom into a portion of <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> provide a clearer view; {{this is similar to}} the functionality of Opera's Nintendo-based web browsers. This version also includes the ability to synchronise with Opera on a personal computer.|$|E

500|$|Normally, in {{the absence}} of serious news, {{comments}} in the forums on the site tend to be of a more sophomoric nature. However, during major events such as the September 11 attacks or the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, usage spikes and the site can actually be seen as a more serious outlet for news. Some users can also contribute greatly to reporting actual events; for instance, the citizen journalism of the events during the 2009 Iranian election protests was recognized by several major media outlets. In response to this coverage, Drew Curtis placed a green band on the letter [...] "K" [...] in the site's logo at the top of <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> <b>to</b> show support for Mir-Hossein Mousavi.|$|E

Jenna, however, believes what she reads and proceeds to imitate all the [...] "facts" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> the amusement of everyone. When she finally confronts Frank, they end up having sex and Jenna is affronted when Frank wants to keep it a secret from their co-workers.

At hearing this, Katie (Elizabeth Rouse), the show's hair dresser and Frank's girlfriend, ruins Jenna's hair and face making her look like a witch.|$|E
500|$|In modern times, the {{familiar}} Western layout, as left-to-right linear Chinese, {{has become more}} popular. Similar to Latin-letter text, the horizontal rows are read from left to right, then top of <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> the bottom. This is used especially in the People's Republic of China (mainland China), where the government mandated left-to-right writing in 1955. [...] The government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) followed suit in 2004 for official documents. [...] The use of punctuation has also become more common, whether the text is written in columns or rows. [...] The punctuation marks are clearly influenced by their Western counterparts, although some marks are particular to Asian languages: for example, the double and single quotation marks (『 』 and 「 」); the hollow period dot (。), which is otherwise used just like an ordinary period full-stop; and {{a special kind of}} comma called an enumeration comma (、), which is used to separate items in a list, as opposed to clauses in a sentence.|$|E

The Library of Congress contacted Peikoff and demanded that he deliver <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>to</b> them, deeming them to be U. S. government property. A complaint from the U.S. Department of Justice followed in October 2000, claiming {{over a million dollars}} in damages unless Peikoff turned over <b>the</b> <b>pages.</b> Peikoff consulted his lawyer, who advised him that the case could go either way if he went to court.

2500|$|Xerography, {{which means}} [...] "dry writing" [...] in Greek, {{is a process}} of making copies. Xerography makes copies without using ink. In this process, static {{electricity}} charges a lighted plate; a plastic powder is applied to the areas of <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> remain white. The photocopier was invented in 1938 by Chester Floyd Carlson who marketed his revolutionary device to about 20 companies before he could interest any. The Haloid Company, later called the Xerox Corporation, marketed it, and xerography eventually became common and inexpensive.|$|E
2500|$|EMS was a {{specification}} {{available on}} all PCs, including the Intel 8086 and Intel 8088 which allowed add-on hardware to page small chunks of memory {{in and out}} of the [...] "real mode" [...] addressing space. (0x0400–0xFFFF). This required that a hole in real memory be available, typically (0xE000–0xEFFF). A program would then have to explicitly request <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> be accessed before using it. These memory locations could then be used arbitrarily until replaced by another page. This is very similar to modern virtual memory. However, in a virtual memory system, the operating system handles all paging operations: the programmer, for the most part, does not have to consider this.|$|E

It was also speculated that Carla Howell's could also drain conservative support from Romney. However, none of the three minor candidates proved to be a numerical factor in the race.|$|E
2500|$|A {{carefully}} composed text page {{appears as}} an orderly series of strips of black separated by horizontal channels of white space. Conversely, in a slovenly setting {{the tendency is}} for <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> appear as a grey and muddled pattern of isolated spats, this effect being caused by the over-widely separated words. The normal, easy, left-to-right movement of the eye is slowed down simply because of this separation; further, the short letters and serifs are unable to discharge an important function – that of keeping the eye on [...] "the line". The eye also tends to be confused by a feeling of vertical emphasis, that is, an up & down movement, induced by the relative isolation of the words & consequent insistence of the ascending and descending letters. This movement is further emphasized by those [...] "rivers" [...] of white which are the inseparable & ugly accompaniment of all carelessly set text matter.|$|E

2500|$|Ileana Sánchez {{invented a}} book for the blind that brings {{together}} art and braille. Ms. Sanchez used a new technique called TechnoPrint and TechnoBraille. Rather than punch through heavy paper to create the raised dots of the Braille alphabet for the blind, these techniques apply an epoxy to <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> create not only raised dots, but raised images with texture. The epoxy melds with the page, becoming part of it, so that you can't scrape it off with your fingernail. The images are raised so that a blind person can feel the artwork and in color, not just to attract the sighted family who will read the book with blind siblings or children, {{but also for the}} blind themselves. The book [...] "Art & the Alphabet, A Tactile Experience" [...] is co-written with Rebecca McGinnis of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met has already incorporated the book into their Access program.|$|E
2500|$|Eggleston {{taught at}} Harvard in 1973 and 1974, {{and it was}} during these years that he {{discovered}} dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: [...] "It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{bibliographer}} Thomas Frognall Dibdin {{reports that}} despite Nicol and Bulmer's {{satisfaction with the}} typeface, they were irked by continuing unfavorable comparisons to Bodoni's output. To demonstrate {{the quality of their}} new typeface that they concocted a [...] "pretty cheat" [...] that they called the [...] "Bodoni Hum". Bulmer set and printed Cicero's De Officiis on four large octavo pages in a style mimicking Bodoni's output. Implying that the type was Bodoni's, Nicol showed the sample to various customers, who were so impressed by its beauty that they were anxious to buy copies. Nicol told them [...] "that Mr. Bodoni had an agent in town; and if they would turn {{to the bottom of the}} last page of the specimen, they would find his address". The customers turned <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>to</b> find printed: [...] "W. Bulmer and Co. Shakspeare Press." [...] (Nicol denied Dibdin's initial assertion that the name [...] "Bodoni Hum" [...] derived from an exchange between Nicol and George III.) The new typeface helped build the reputation of Bulmer and Nicol's printing office, and the high quality of his output in turn helped build the reputation and popularity of British-produced books in the late-18th century. The association with William Bulmer was continued by Nicol's son William, who ran Bulmer's press from 1819 to 1835. George Nicol's partnership with Bulmer was formally dissolved on 31 December 1819.|$|E
