Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>anonymous.</b>|$|E

At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.|$|E

Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership.|$|E

40|$|We {{start with}} the usual {{paradigm}} in electronic commerce: a consumer who wants to buy from a merchant. However, both parties wish to enjoy maximal privacy. In addition <b>to</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>anonymous,</b> the consumer wants to hide her browsing pattern and even {{the identification of the}} product she may decide to buy. Nevertheless, she {{wants to be able to}} negotiate the price, pay, receive the product and even enjoy maintenance on it. On the other hand, the merchant wants to leak as little information as possible on his catalogue for fear that he might in fact be dealing with a hostile competitor. For this purpose, we introduce the Blind Customer Buying Behaviour model, which adds confidentiality to the standard Customer Buying Behaviour model. In this paper, we concentrate on blind catalogue browsing...|$|R

5|$|While medieval Indian {{artisans}} preferred <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>anonymous,</b> Hoysala artisans signed their works, {{which has}} given researchers details about their lives, families, guilds, etc. Apart from the architects and sculptors, {{people of other}} guilds such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, carpenters, and silversmiths {{also contributed to the}} completion of temples. The artisans were from diverse geographical backgrounds and included famous locals. Prolific architects included Amarashilpi Jakanachari, a native of Kaidala in Tumkur district, who also built temples for the Western Chalukyas. Ruvari Malithamma built the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura and worked on forty other monuments, including the Amruteshwara temple at Amruthapura. Malithamma specialised in ornamentation, and his works span six decades. His sculptures were typically signed in shorthand as Malli or simply Ma. Dasoja and his son Chavana from Balligavi were the architects of Chennakesava Temple at Belur; Kedaroja was the chief architect of the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu. Their influence is seen in other temples built by the Hoysalas as well. Names of other locals found in inscriptions are Maridamma, Baicoja, Caudaya, Nanjaya and Bama, Malloja, Nadoja, Siddoja, Masanithamma, Chameya and Rameya. Artists from Tamil country included Pallavachari and Cholavachari.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of this tour, My Chemical Romance dubbed {{themselves}} The Black Parade for the first part of their performance, convincing many concert goers that The Black Parade was initially a separate, opening band. During the tour there were several cancellations and some members left the tour for personal or medical reasons. Leading up to their tour date at The DCU Arena, many of the staff members of the tour fell ill with food poisoning. The band Circa Survive had to replace Muse, members of which also suffered from the same food poisoning. On January 11, 2007 Frank Iero left the tour because of an unspecified illness. He was replaced by Drive By guitarist Todd Price. Mikey Way took time off to get married and spend time with his new wife (Alicia Simmons) and was replaced by guitar tech, Matt Cortez, from April 18, 2007 until October 4, 2007. Six shows were cancelled from April 29, 2007 to May 4, 2007 after the band and crew contracted food poisoning. Bob Bryar suffered injuries relating to his wrists during the tour which led to the cancellation of the show at the University of Maine on October 27, 2007. Bryar left the tour on November 9, 2007 and was replaced by a friend of the band, Wagner, who wished <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>anonymous.</b> Following the November 11, 2007 show in Newcastle, Frank Iero left the tour to return home after learning about a family member's illness. He was replaced by Matt Cortez.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—WiFi sharing {{communities}} {{are an interesting}} option for mobile Internet access. Today, however, users need to give up privacy in exchange for connectivity: {{they are required to}} expose their identity in order to be granted access. This information can be used to track users and to generate usage and movement profiles. We identify the challenges of providing a maximum level of privacy and anonymity in a WiFi community. From a discussion of privacy properties of existing architectures, we arrive at a privacy-aware WiFi sharing design for fully anonymous usage—without sacrificing any participant’s security or legal safety. This system, like some previous designs, relays a mobile user’s data via this user’s home network; we discuss how and under which circumstances this contributes to privacy and anonymity. In order to enable users <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> fully <b>anonymous</b> in such a system, a means to locate the home network of a user without leaking permanent identifiers is needed. We introduce and evaluate volatile host names, a novel method to generate anonymized, non-persistent host names in standard DNS. I...|$|R
5000|$|The Xperedon {{system is}} based on its users {{building}} their own Personal Charity Plan. This plan allows customers to specify details about {{the way in which}} they donate, including; the amount they give, which charities they give to, and the way in which those donations are distributed. Once the user has chosen how much to give in total, and the list of charities they wish to give to (their Charity Portfolio), they can opt either to distribute their total donation between those evenly, or weight their donations in favour of one or more particular charities. Customers control who they give to, the amount they give, and how the amount is spread. Xperedon then takes care of all of the administration and settlement with the charities. Customers can choose to prioritise their donations, offering a higher percentage to a particular charity, and can alter this amount at any time, for example increasing aid to African charities in a particularly bad year of famine. Xperedon calls the amount a particular customer decides to give their [...] "uplift".
