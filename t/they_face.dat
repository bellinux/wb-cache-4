5|$|Portrayals of lesbians in {{the media}} suggest that society at large has been {{simultaneously}} intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection <b>they</b> <b>face</b> from their families, friends, and others {{as a result of}} homophobia. As women, <b>they</b> <b>face</b> concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, prejudice, and minority stress. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan and Rabbi Eleazar {{differed}} {{on how the}} Cherubim stood. One {{said that}} <b>they</b> <b>faced</b> each other, and the other said <b>they</b> <b>faced</b> inward (toward the door). The Gemara asked how one could reconcile the view that <b>they</b> <b>faced</b> each other with 2 Chronicles [...] which says, [...] "And their faces were inward." [...] The Gemara explained that <b>they</b> <b>faced</b> each other (in a sign of affection, symbolizing the relationship between God and the people) when Israel obeyed God's will of God; <b>they</b> <b>faced</b> inward (away from each other, symbolizing God's unrequited love for Israel) when Israel did not obey God's will. The Gemara asked how one could reconcile the view that <b>they</b> <b>faced</b> inward with , which says, [...] "With their faces one to another." [...] The Gemara explained that they were slightly turned sideways (partly facing each other and partly facing inward). As it was taught in a Baraita, Onkelos the proselyte said that the Cherubim were formed like children (as some read [...] ) and their faces were turned sideways, {{like those of a}} student who takes leave of the student's master (turning sideways for some distance before turning the student's back completely on the master).|$|R

5|$|According to Glajar, this is {{the world}} of the narrator's mother, who writes of her sicknesses in her letters in the hope of keeping her {{daughter}} emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father {{was a member of the}} SS (as were Müller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timişoara, where the main characters attend college—between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. <b>They</b> <b>face</b> new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt.|$|E

5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers <b>they</b> <b>face,</b> the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E

5|$|IRIS {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} cast split between characters of North Korean and South Korean descent.

Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

Indian air force planners never reinforced failure or repeated tactics that the U.S. easily repelled. Moreover, the IAF's airborne commanders changed tactics as opportunities arose. Nor did U.S. pilots believe <b>they</b> <b>faced</b> only India's top guns.
