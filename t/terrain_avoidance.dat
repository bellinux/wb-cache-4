5|$|On 18 November 1966, a B-52G AF Ser. No. 58-0228 {{deployed}} from Barksdale Air Force Base {{crashed and}} was destroyed when it {{flew into the}} ground in swampland south of Stone Lake, Sawyer County, Wisconsin. The crew was on a low level <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> night mission, before SAC stopped such flights, and had just entered low altitude and were calibrating their <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> radar, when they flew too low, clipped {{the tops of the}} forest and crashed.|$|E
5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and inertial {{navigation system}}, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), {{instrument landing system}} (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E

50|$|Other STOL {{features}} {{included a}} dorsal and two ventral fins {{on the rear}} fuselage, double-slotted flaps and extended ailerons, a new radome, a tailhook for landing aboard an aircraft carrier, and Combat Talon avionics, including a <b>Terrain</b> Following/Terrain <b>Avoidance</b> radar, a defensive countermeasures suite, and a Doppler radar/GPS tie-in to the aircraft's inertial navigation system.|$|R
25|$|The crew's {{training}} {{mission was}} called a <b>Terrain</b> <b>Avoidance</b> Flight to practice techniques to penetrate Advanced Capability Radar (ACR) undetected by Soviet air defense during the Cold War. ACR training flights had already been made over the West Coast of the United States on Poker Deck routes. This {{was to be the}} first low-level navigation flight, utilizing terrain-following radar, in the Eastern United States.|$|E
25|$|IAI {{subsidiary}} Elta held {{responsibility for}} the electronic warfare self-protection systems. These are {{claimed to have been}} capable of rapid threat identification and automated response, incorporating a suite of active and passive countermeasures, such as power-managed noise and deception jamming systems. Both podded and internal countermeasures were to be used. Elta also developed the EL/M-2032 Doppler multi-mode radar for the Lavi, which was equipped with a programmable signal processor and was capable of various air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, including high-resolution mapping, <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance,</b> and look-down/shoot-down functionality.|$|E
25|$|A {{key area}} of {{advancement}} on the Mirage F1 over its predecessors {{was in its}} onboard avionics. The Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV monopulse radar system, developed from the Cyrano II unit installed on the Mirage IIIE, serves as the main sensor; it operates in three different modes: air-target acquisition and tracking, ground mapping, and <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance.</b> The later Cyrano IV-1 model also provided for a limited look-down capability. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the Cyrano IV radar was capable of detecting aerial targets at double the range of earlier models. The standard production Mirage F1 was furnished with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), radar altimeter, UHF/VHF radio sets, Tactical Air Navigation system (TACAN) and aground data link. Other avionics include an autopilot and yaw damper.|$|E
5000|$|Precise {{knowledge}} of terrain is vital in aviation, especially for low-flying routes and maneuvers (see <b>terrain</b> collision <b>avoidance)</b> and airport altitudes. Terrain will also affect range {{and performance of}} radars and terrestrial radio navigation systems. Furthermore, a hilly or mountainous terrain can strongly impact {{the implementation of a}} new aerodrome and the orientation of its runways.|$|R
5000|$|The MH-47E {{has been}} used by U.S. Army Special Operations. Beginning with the E-model {{prototype}} manufactured in 1991, a total of 26 Special Operations Aircraft was produced. All aircraft were assigned to 2-160th SOAR(A) [...] "Nightstalkers", home based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. E models were conversions from existing CH-47C model airframes. The MH-47E has similar capabilities as the MH-47D, but includes an increased fuel capacity similar to the CH-47SD and <b>terrain</b> following/terrain <b>avoidance</b> radar.|$|R

25|$|A {{wide range}} of {{avionics}} have been integrated upon the AW119, which are typically housed within the rotorcraft's nose. Initial production models featured conventional flight instruments; the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit is integrated on the newer AW119Kx variant, which is claimed to improve situational awareness, reduce pilot workload, and increase safety. Primary flight and other key information is displayed to the pilots upon two large 10.4 inch multi-function displays in the cockpit; an independently powered stand-by display is also present in case of system failure. Other avionics used include a 3-axis aircraft flight control system (AFCS), Synthetic Vision System (SVS), Highway In The Sky (HITS) depiction, moving map display, radio altimeter, VOR/ILS/GPS/WAAS navigation, Aural Warning Generator, and embedded Helicopter <b>Terrain</b> <b>Avoidance</b> Warning System (HTAWS).|$|E

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to analyse the safety of avionic systems {{that takes into account}} the impact of computation and communication resource sharing. The approach is made of three main steps: use a formal notation to describe how failures propagate in the system under study, use model-checking tools to verify safety requirements and to derive allocation constraints, use a constraint solver to generate safe allocations.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{methodology}} for agent modeling that is scalable and efficient. It {{is based on}} the integration of nonlinear dynamical systems and kinetic data structures. The method consists of three layers, which together model 3 D agent steering, crowds and flocks among moving and static obstacles. The first layer, the local layer employs nonlinear dynamical systems theory to models low-level behaviors. It is fast and efficient, and it does not depend on the total number of agents in the environment. This dynamical systems-based approach also allows us to establish continuous numerical parameters for modifying each agent’s behavior. The second layer, a global environment layer consists of a specifically designed kinetic data structure to track efficiently the immediate environment of each agent and know which obstacles/agents are near or visible to the given agent. This layer reduces the complexity in the local layer. In the third layer, a global planning layer, the problem of target tracking is generalized in a way that allows navigation in maze-like <b>terrains,</b> <b>avoidance</b> of local minima and cooperation between agents. We implement this layer based on two approaches that are suitable for different applications: One approach is to track the closest single moving or static target; the second is to use a pre-specified vector field, which may be generated automatically (with harmonic functions, for example) or based on user input to achieve the desired output. We also discuss how hybrid systems concepts for global planning can capitalize on both our layered approach and the continuous, reactive nature of our agent steering. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a series of experiments simulating single/multiple agents and crowds moving towards moving/static targets in complex environments. r 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{first of}} 12 MC-130Ws, AF Ser. No. 87-9286, was {{presented}} to Air Force Special Operations Command on June 28, 2006. The aircraft was developed to supplement the MC-130 Combat Talon and Combat Shadow forces as an interim measure after several training accidents and contingency losses in supporting the Global War on Terrorism. The program modified C-130H-2 airframes from the 1987-1990 production run, acquired from airlift units in the Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard. Use of the H-2 airframe allowed installation of SOF systems already configured for Combat Talons without expensive and time-consuming development {{that would be required}} of new production C-130J aircraft, reducing the flyaway cost of the Spear to $60 million per aircraft. The Combat Spears, however, do not have a <b>Terrain</b> Following/Terrain <b>Avoidance</b> capability.|$|R
40|$|A computer-simulation {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate a}} maximum concealment guidance technique (pop-up maneuver), which military aircraft may use to capture a glide path from masked, low-altitude flight typical of <b>terrain</b> following/terrain <b>avoidance</b> flight enroute. The guidance system applied to this problem is the Fuel Conservative Guidance System. Previous studies using this system have concentrated on the saving of fuel in basically conventional land and ship-based operations. Because this system is based on energy-management concepts, it also has direct application to the pop-up approach which exploits aircraft performance. Although the algorithm was initially designed to reduce fuel consumption, the commanded deceleration is at its upper limit during the pop-up and, therefore, is a good approximation of a minimum-time solution. Using the model of a powered-lift aircraft, {{the results of the}} study demonstrated that guidance commands generated by the system are well within the capability of an automatic flight-control system. Results for several initial approach conditions are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to show a way to {{increase}} air traffic safety through automation and this way permit its growth. An algorithm has been built to allow fully automatic mid-air collision, ground, <b>terrain</b> or building <b>avoidance,</b> without any intervention from the pilot. Additionally, the algorithm allows fully automatic navigation. These capabilities have been tested through simulation. We plan to use this software with a flight simulator. The software will take the pilot’s place in these tests. This way the software will be evaluated in a similar way to how pilots learn and are assessed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an imaging system for aircraft guidance that provides panoramic stereo vision to facilitate surveillance, obstacle detection and <b>avoidance,</b> <b>terrain</b> following and landing. The system uses a single video camera {{in conjunction with}} a set of specially shaped reflective surfaces to enable the detection of objects in the environment and estimation of their range through stereo. The advantage of this device over systems that use optic flow information for visual guidance {{is that it does not}} rely on the movement the aircraft. Therefore, it can be used even at low flight speeds or hover. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in 1970, Texas Instruments and Lockheed Air Service {{worked to}} adapt the {{existing}} AN/APQ-122 Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System (AWADS) with <b>terrain</b> following/terrain <b>avoidance</b> modes to replace the original APQ-115, which suffered throughout its life with an unacceptably adverse mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) rate. In 1970 they succeeded, and coupled the APQ-122 with the Litton LN-15J Inertial Navigation System (INS). Known as MOD-70, the modified radar was installed in all 12 operational Combat Talons and the four Heavy Chain test beds between 1971-1973. The system proved so successful that it continued in service until the late 1980s. Following the completion of MOD-70, the Combat Talons were divided into three designations: C-130E(CT) for the [...] "Clamp" [...] aircraft, C-130E(Y) for the [...] "Yank" [...] (formerly [...] "Yard") Talons, and C-130E(S) for the [...] "Swap". The Combat Talon I designations were consolidated in 1977 as the MC-130 and have remained under that designation since. The Combat Talon became the Combat Talon I in 1984 with the authorization for the modification of 24 C-130Hs to Combat Talon II specifications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{previous}} studies, we {{described how}} complicated {{tasks such as}} ground <b>avoidance,</b> <b>terrain</b> following, takeoff and landing can be performed using optic flow sensors mounted on a tethered flying robot called OCTAVE. In the present study, a new programmable visual motion sensor connected to a lightweight Bluetooth module was mounted on a free-flying 50 -gram helicopter called TwinCoax. This small helicopter model equipped with 3 IR-reflective markers was flown in a dedicated room equipped with a VICON system to record its trajectory.

Many elements of the cockpit and avionics {{are similar to those}} installed on the AgustaWestland AW139 and the AgustaWestland AW189, providing a high level of support. The use of a four-axis digital automatic flight control system and a dual flight management system incorporating <b>terrain</b> and traffic <b>avoidance</b> systems has allowed for the rotorcraft to be certified to be flown by a single pilot under instrument flight rules (IFR).|$|R
50|$|Although a SID {{will keep}} {{aircraft}} away from terrain, it is optimized for {{air traffic control}} route of flight and will not always provide the lowest climb gradient. It strikes a balance between <b>terrain</b> and obstacle <b>avoidance,</b> noise abatement (if necessary), and airspace management considerations. In order to legally fly a SID, a pilot must possess at least {{the current version of}} the SID's textual description. SIDs in the United States are created by either the military (the USAF or USN) or the FAA (which includes US Army fields). The main difference between US military and civilian SIDs is that military SIDs depict obstacles, ATC climb gradients, and obstacle climb gradients, while civilian SIDs depict only minimum obstacle climb gradients.|$|R
