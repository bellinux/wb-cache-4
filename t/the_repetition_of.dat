5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves <b>the</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages {{at different times}} and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E

This type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E

5|$|Alliteration is <b>the</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> {{letters or}} letter-sounds at the {{beginning}} of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance {{played a key role in}} structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.|$|E

To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{symbolism}} of the garden, particularly of the carvings, as well as <b>the</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> sevens and threes, has inspired many interpretations. The engravings upon which the carvings are based were commonplace in Scotland at the time, and were frequently used {{in the art of}} memory, a mnemonic memory technique associated with Freemasonry. The art of memory had become a feature throughout Scottish culture, from the court of Queen Anne, Danish consort of James VI, to the lodges of operative stonemasons. The potential influence of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's symbolic garden at Uraniborg, which was visited by James IV of Scotland in 1590, has also been noted.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image that {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. <b>The</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in that memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E

Since key lengths 2 and 1 are unrealistically short, one only needs to try lengths 16, 8, or 4.

The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. <b>The</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher.

The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world.

The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
