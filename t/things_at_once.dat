25|$|Barrie {{was very}} perspicacious in noticing {{many aspects of}} children's mental {{development}} decades before they were studied by cognitive psychologists. In particular, Peter lacks the mental capacity for secondary mental representation and cannot recollect the past, anticipate the future, consider two <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> or see things from another person's point of view. He is therefore amnesic, inconsequential, impulsive and callous.|$|E
25|$|Mike Bracken of IGN {{criticized the}} film, saying that EM Embalmings {{greatest}} failure {{is that it}} often tries to be too many <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> and the film itself is almost as schizophrenic as its antagonist. However, he felt that several sequences of the embalming process are gruesome and extended conversations between Miyako and the black market organ harvester are eerily intriguing.|$|E

25|$|The Fulton {{arrived to}} Asunción, with the {{intention}} to recognize the independence of Paraguay, recruit them against Rosas, and sign a treaty of commerce and friendship. Carlos Antonio López did not agree to the British terms, he expected recognition first, war later, and a treaty for the end; not all <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> The commerce failed, as Corrientes and Paraguay were not as wealthy as the Anglo-French expected, and they returned with most of their products.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to smart cards, which are simple devices performing a single function, personal computers are doing many <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> Thus, {{it is much}} more difficult to perform electromagnetic side-channel attacks against them, due to high levels of noise and fast clock rates. Despite these issues, researchers in 2015 and 2016 showed attacks against a laptop using a near-field magnetic probe. The resulting signal, observed for only a few seconds, was filtered, amplified, and digitized for offline key extraction. Most attacks require expensive, lab-grade equipment, and require the attacker to be extremely close to the victim computer. However, some researchers were able to show attacks using cheaper hardware and from distances of up to half a meter. These attacks, however, required the collection of more traces than the more expensive attacks.|$|E
25|$|Air : The air {{signs are}} Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs {{will be an}} {{excellent}} communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. They have many friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. They {{are interested in the}} latest technologies and are able to do a number of <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

Quick womanly instinct made her heart bleed for her daughter's manifest shame and horror.|$|R
500|$|... "suggests that activity-based surveys {{should be}} {{supplemented}} by more stylized questions regarding care responsibilities" [...] as otherwise such {{activities can be}} undercounted.

500|$|Every year {{we change}} fewer wheels, because the {{wheels and tyres}} are getting better and better. We changed about 20 wheels today. Five years ago, it was much worse— we'd be {{choosing}} about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. So, yes, our job is easier— except that the race generally goes faster now, so we're under a bit more pressure. Every year, there's new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it's getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a flat tyre {{we need to think}} of a lot of <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> Is it a titanium frame or a carbon frame or a steel frame? ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{the cast}} and crew {{admitted}} that filming an episode of The X-Files in real time was physically and mentally exhausting. Duchovny later joked that, after filming concluded, he [...] "could win an Emmy for most bruises." [...] Gillian Anderson described the real time directing style as [...] "challenging." [...] She said, [...] "I'm realizing how comfortable and connected I am to the rhythm we're used to." [...] Tom Braidwood, who played Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike and was an assistant director on the show, called Davis' role [...] "brutal" [...] and noted that [...] "It was really tough for William because he had to learn all this German." [...] Davis later joked that [...] "Maybe we shouldn't try to do two clever <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> I think it worked fine, but it was a struggle to do it." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{they are}} not England, {{they are not}} the English reality, which is a <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> bright and {{illuminating}} and fitful, a thing humorous and wise and adventurous--Shakespeare, Dickens, Newton, Darwin, Nelson, Bacon, Shelley--English names every one--like the piercing light of lanterns swinging and swaying among the branches of dark trees at night.|$|R
60|$|And {{even if no}} {{one knew}} {{anything}} about it, they might get too fond of each other, and then there could be nothing but the misery of parting, after all.

60|$|Ordauro, however, did a <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{the most}} bold {{and the most}} ingenious.

500|$|An unusual rhetorical device, hendiadys, {{appears in}} several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech {{at the end of}} the nunnery scene: [...] "Thexpectancy and rose of the fair state" [...] and [...] "And I, of ladies most deject and wretched". Many {{scholars}} have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that Hamlet was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation. Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in Hamlet because he [...] "showed how a character's language can often be saying several <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings". She gives the example of Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, [...] "get thee to a nunnery", which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet's confused feelings about female sexuality.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{collaborated with}} Paul Thomas Anderson {{for the fifth}} time in The Master (2012), where he turned in what critic Peter Bradshaw {{considered}} the most memorable performance of his career. Set in 1950s America, the film featured Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the charismatic leader of a nascent Scientology-type movement who brings a troubled man (Joaquin Phoenix) under his tutelage. Hoffman was instrumental in the project's development, having been involved with it for three years. He assisted Anderson in the writing of the script by reviewing samples of it, and suggested making Phoenix's character, Freddie Quell, the protagonist instead of Dodd. A talented dancer, Hoffman was able to showcase his abilities by performing a jig during a surreal sequence; Bradshaw called it an [...] "extraordinary moment" [...] that [...] "only Hoffman could have carried off." [...] The Master was praised as an intelligent and challenging drama, and Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader also felt that it contained Hoffman's finest work: [...] "He's inscrutable yet welcoming, intimidating yet charismatic, villainous yet fatherly. He epitomizes so many <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> that it's impossible to think of [...] as mere movie character". Hoffman and Phoenix received a joint Volpi Cup Award at the Venice Film Festival for their performances, and Hoffman was also nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and a SAG Award for the supporting role.|$|E
500|$|In The Daily Telegraph Christopher Howse {{concentrated}} on the moral arguments in the book, and agreed with Hitchens that [...] "to determine {{what is right and}} what is wrong without God, is difficult". [...] Also in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore wrote that the book [...] "tries to do two <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author's polemical skill. The other is to give an autobiographical account of how, in our time, an intelligent man's faith may recover". In a positive review in Standpoint magazine, Michael Nazir Ali wrote, [...] "One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict. He does this by showing that so-called [...] "religious" [...] wars had many other elements to them, such as greed for territory, political ambition and nationalism. His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion." [...] In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote, [...] "Hitchens makes his case forcefully, passionately and intelligently", but [...] "makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism". Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent, where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens's conclusions, including that [...] "atheists 'actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness'". In a sympathetic review in The Guardian, Rupert Shortt wrote, [...] "Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity. He is wise to avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters, because his strengths lie elsewhere. His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great: that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith; that [...] "it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God"; and that [...] "atheist states are not actually atheist". In The Spectator, Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively, describing it as [...] "a magnificent, sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking control of our weakened culture".|$|E

2500|$|Lucifer's Crown {{is not an}} easy book to {{describe}} or classify. It tries to be many <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> but first and foremost, it's a novel of Biblical apocalypse. In a time where Christian fiction with an apocalyptic bent — led by the wildly popular Left Behind series — is a multi-million dollar industry, it was inevitable that more traditional fantasy writers would eventually turn their hand to these tropes and themes. Lillian Stewart Carl, in taking up this challenge, has responded with her most complex and ambitious novel to date. What's more important, it's also by far her best.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{its initial}} release on New Alliance, the EP was reissued in several {{versions}} {{and as part}} of compilation albums over the next 10 years. In 1985, New Alliance re-released it as part of the Bonus Fat compilation, pairing it with the tracks from [...] "Ride the Wild" [...] / [...] "It's a Hectic World" [...] and [...] "Global Probing" [...] from a New Alliance/SST Records compilation titled Chunks. In 1987, New Alliance was sold to SST, who re-released Bonus Fat on EP, cassette and compact disc. In 1988, it was paired with the band's debut album Milo Goes to College as Two <b>Things</b> <b>at</b> <b>Once.</b> [...] "My Dad Sucks", [...] "I Like Food", and [...] "Weinerschnitzel" [...] were also included on the 1991 career retrospective Somery.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} stages of an incident, first {{responders}} may be overwhelmed by the scope of patients and injuries. One valuable technique is the Patient Assist Method (PAM). [...] The responders quickly establish a casualty collection point (CCP) and advise, either by yelling, or over a loudspeaker, that [...] "anyone requiring assistance should move to the selected area (CCP)". This does several <b>things</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> it identifies patients that are not so severely injured, that they need immediate help, it physically clears the scene, and provides possible assistants to the responders. As those who can move, do so, the responders then ask, [...] "anyone who still needs assistance, yell out or raise your hands"; this further identifies patients who are responsive, yet maybe unable to move. Now the responders can rapidly assess the remaining patients who are either expectant, or are in need of immediate aid. From that point the first responder is quickly able to identify those in need of immediate attention, while not being distracted or overwhelmed by the magnitude of the situation. [...] Using this method assumes the ability to hear. [...] Deaf, partially deaf, or victims of a large blast injury {{may not be able to}} hear these instructions.|$|E
