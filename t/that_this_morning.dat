2500|$|Selig's {{testimony}} {{on the subject}} has been contradictory. [...] In 2005, Selig told reporters, [...] "I never even heard about them [...] until 1998 or 1999. [...] I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them. [...] It wasn't until 1998 or ’99 that I heard the discussion." [...] But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: [...] "In 1994, before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA. [...] As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing substances from the game." [...] During the 1988 ALCS, Oakland's Jose Canseco had been repeatedly taunted by Boston fans with a chant of [...] "ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids." [...] Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, [...] "People say, ‘Well, you were slow to react.’ We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and it aggravated me all over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can give}} you even better proof than <b>that.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> Mortimer {{came to me and}} asked me to give him secret lessons in golf." ...|$|E
60|$|Lane {{was indeed}} {{grateful}} for a change. Mel had been unaccountably depressed during those gloomy days. And it worried him <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{she did not}} appear her usual self.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every one to his tastes," [...] Lady Alice observed, as {{she turned}} away with a {{friendly}} little nod. [...] "I have just an idea, however, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> excursion {{was a little too}} much even for Jane." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you {{ran away}} from the big ship <b>that</b> sailed <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Well, why don't {{you go to your}} countrymen here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Willing {{took his}} turn at smiling. [...] "Didn't look <b>that</b> way <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> did it? But she's all right now--except that she's terribly wrought up over Hanscom's predicament." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{will say}} 'our friend,' Millicent; {{and he made}} a {{communication}} to me <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I had to go to Mr. Prendergast and make a communication to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{air of a}} sans-culotte?" [...] he cried. [...] "My faith, yes. So much so, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I imposed {{myself as}} a courier from Paris upon no less an astute sleuth-hound of the Convention than the Citizen-deputy La Boulaye." ...|$|E
6000|$|BUILDER. You can't irritate me {{more than}} by having secrets. See what that led to in your sister's case. And, by the way, I'm going {{to put an end}} to <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> You'll be glad to have her back, won't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Locker, [...] "I am {{beginning}} to like you, although I must admit <b>that</b> before <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I can remember no {{feeling of the}} sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am. I am," [...] {{she cried}} fiercely. [...] "When I got <b>that</b> letter <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I said MAY EVIL BEFALL YOU, YOU SELFISH DEMON. And I hope it may." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, {{there is}} a little package for you in my room, <b>that</b> came <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I brought it up, but forgot to give it to you. You'll find it on my table." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, I {{have nothing}} to say about <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It may be so; or, again, it may not; I read a good many things in books every week the sense of which I cannot understand. At all events it is not the {{salvation}} of which Isaiah speaks here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} whether it {{concerns}} you," [...] she said, [...] "but I will warn you <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> a mounted man from Fairford came by warning all to seize a tall countryman with a young fellow and a woman with him, for that she was no other than King Charles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Treachery!" [...] exclaimed the old man. [...] "We were no {{more than}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It is indeed {{fortunate}} that you found us. I take it you are from Fort Henry, and will guide us there? I am an old friend of Colonel Zane's. He will appreciate any kindness you may show us. Of course you know him?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. But {{even then}} it's so often their own fault. Look at <b>that</b> Mrs. Jones <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} I'm telling you all this. I can't usually talk about it. But {{the sight of}} <b>that</b> {{congregation}} <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> mixed as it was, {{and the way he}} managed to weld it together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{beginning}} {{to split up}} the back," [...] the supercargo lamented. [...] "I noticed <b>that</b> much <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> when he hadn't had it on ten minutes. It cost me thirty shillings and I only wore it once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Practically so; in any case, Dr. Slyder {{insists on}} his not using it. In fact, poor McTeague's {{mind is a}} wreck. His nurse was telling me <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> he was {{reaching}} out his hand for the newspaper, and {{seemed to want to}} read one of the editorials. It was quite pathetic," [...] concluded Dr. Boomer, shaking his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "All I {{know about}} it officially is <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> Mr. King {{resigned}} {{in the name of}} himself and his party; and as you know, I told you when they first joined us, they did so on the explicit understanding that they should be allowed to resign when they chose, and that provision was inserted when they were sworn in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} Mr. Britling says about you in his 'American Impressions,'" [...] she said. [...] "He says that America overdoes the {{development}} of personalities altogether, that whatever else is wrong about America that is where America is most clearly wrong. I read <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and directly I read it I thought, 'Yes, that's exactly it! Mr. Direck is overdoing the development of personalities.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the problem," [...] said Jolnes. [...] "My wife tied <b>that</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{to remind}} me of {{something}} I was to send up to the house. Sit down, Whatsup, and excuse me for a few moments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is a capital plan. I do not mind a share of fair fighting; but to be shot down {{suddenly}} in an ambush like <b>that</b> of <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I own I have little fancy for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{can tell}} you, gentlemen," [...] said the Doctor, stiffly, [...] "that {{they were in}} Monterey last night, {{that they did not}} return on <b>that</b> trail <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>that</b> they must have passed here at daybreak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They think they'll {{drive me}} away from the studio; but they won't; I shall stay there just exactly as long as it suits me. All <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> it was Lucy Otter's doing, I know it was. She always has hated me. She thought after that I'd take myself off. I daresay she'd like me to go. She's afraid I know too much about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even in this country, with {{a little}} help," [...] he said, [...] "those things are easy enough. I {{made up my mind}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> would be to some extent a crisis with you. You know, Tavernake, I am not a man who says much, but you are the right sort. You've been in with me twice when I should have missed you if you hadn't been there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An excuse is {{very easily}} found," [...] she sighed. [...] "German {{diplomacy}} is clumsy enough, but I {{think it can}} manage that. Do you know <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I had a letter {{from one of the}} greatest nobles of our own Court at Vienna? He knew that I had intended to take a villa in Normandy for August and September. He has written purposely to warn me not to do so, to warn me not to be away from Austria or Germany after the first of August." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Tuppence thoughtfully, [...] "he didn't believe it. That's {{the curious}} part about {{speaking}} the truth. No one does believe it. I found <b>that</b> out <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Now let's go to lunch. How about the Savoy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... .... A {{stranger}} {{wearing a}} stovepipe hat arrived in town yesterday, putting {{up at the}} Nugget House. The boys are {{having a good time}} with <b>that</b> hat <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and the funeral will take place at two o'clock.--Spanish Camp [...] "Flag." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Except for <b>that</b> {{letter in}} <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> paper I {{should never have}} dared to say {{anything}} to you again. But that changes everything.' ...|$|R
60|$|I know <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{he spent}} {{hours in the}} lazarette with the steward and the cook, {{overhauling}} and checking off from the lists of the Baltimore agents. And I know that they came {{up out of the}} lazarette, the three of them, dripping with perspiration and baffled. The steward has raised the hypothesis that, first of all, there were extra stores left over from the previous voyage, or from previous voyages, and, next, that the stealing of these stores must have taken place during the night-watches when it was Mr. Pike's turn below.|$|E
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning the priest left Drumsna for Carrick, to see Thady {{for the first time since}} his condemnation. McKeon offered to go with him; but he {{declined}} the offer, saying, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> he would sooner be left alone with his doomed friend. He refused, too, the loan of McKeon's car. He wanted to collect his thoughts and his energy by the walk, for he felt that he had much to do to school his own feelings before he could make his visit a comfort instead of a cause of additional distress to Macdermot.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{wished to}} tell Sir Robert, {{but he is}} {{preparing}} the assault for to-morrow {{and will not be}} turned from his purpose. I have indeed a plan, but whether it be good or not I cannot say until I have tried it. But first I will tell you what put it into my thoughts. Know then <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> when I was in yonder ditch I marked one of their men upon the wall. He was a big man with a white face, red hair and a touch of Saint Anthony's fire upon the cheek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he said. [...] "I presume <b>that</b> {{your visit}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{was one of}} courtesy. You are acquainted with Mr. Fielding?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Shut <b>that</b> door there; <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> air is cold. [They {{close the}} door on the corridor.] [Enter the Duchess {{followed}} by a crowd of meanly dressed Citizens.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly {{they are}} comely youths," [...] Tippoo said, [...] "and one would {{scarcely}} deem them capable of performing such a feat as <b>that</b> they accomplished <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
