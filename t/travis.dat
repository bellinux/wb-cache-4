5|$|On February 3, Davy Crockett {{appeared}} with thirtyTennesseans. Neill went on furlough on February 11 {{to visit his}} sick family, leaving <b>Travis,</b> {{a member of the}} regular army, in command. Bowie was older than <b>Travis</b> with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking <b>Travis,</b> a lieutenant colonel. He refused to answer to <b>Travis,</b> who called an election for the men to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating <b>Travis.</b> Bowie celebrated his appointment by getting very drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. <b>Travis</b> was disgusted, but twodays later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and <b>Travis</b> would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry.|$|E
5|$|By late {{afternoon}} Béxar {{was occupied by}} about 1,500 Mexican soldiers. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, <b>Travis</b> responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon. Believing that <b>Travis</b> had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. <b>Travis</b> was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional. On learning this, Bowie and <b>Travis</b> mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.|$|E

5|$|A report {{written by}} Roger <b>Travis</b> and {{published}} by The Escapist compares Halo with the Latin epic Aeneid, written by classical Roman poet Virgil. <b>Travis</b> posits similarities between the plots of both works and compares the characters present in them, with the Flood and Covenant taking the role performed by the Carthaginians, and the Master Chief's role in the series to that of Aeneas.|$|E

5|$|Driving past Silent Hill as a shortcut, <b>Travis</b> swerves {{his truck}} to avoid hitting a spirit manifestation of Alessa. While {{following}} the spirit manifestation, he stumbles upon a burning house and rescues the real Alessa, who was immolated in a ritual to impregnate {{her with the}} cult's god. Losing consciousness outside the house, he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, <b>Travis</b> unlocks his repressed childhood memories and defeats monstrous forms of his parents: {{his mother had been}} committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, and his father had killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned. Additionally, <b>Travis</b> kills the Butcher, a monster that has been slaughtering other monsters.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Travis's</b> first {{project as}} a golf course {{architect}} was his collaboration with John Duncan Dunn in the 1899 design of Ekwanok Country Club in Vermont. However, much of <b>Travis's</b> early acclaim and notoriety as a golf course designer may be traced to his extensive remodeling of the Garden City Golf Club's Devereux Emmet course, that was unveiled when Garden City Golf Club hosted the 1908 U.S. Amateur Championship. [...] In all, nearly 50 golf courses bear his mark, either as an original design, or as a remodeling project. [...] Through <b>Travis's</b> consultations with the original designers, several noted courses reflect his influence, including Pine Valley Golf Club, National Golf Links of America, and Pinehurst No. 2.|$|R

5|$|On February 11, Neill {{left the}} Alamo, {{determined}} to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. He transferred command to <b>Travis,</b> the highest-ranking regular army {{officer in the}} garrison. Volunteers comprised much of the garrison, and they were unwilling to accept <b>Travis</b> as their leader. The men instead elected Bowie, who {{had a reputation as}} a fierce fighter, as their commander. Bowie celebrated by getting very intoxicated and creating havoc in Béxar. To mitigate the resulting ill feelings, Bowie agreed to share command with <b>Travis.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>Travis</b> Branch is {{a branch}} of the Staten Island Railway in New York City, that {{operates}} from Arlington Yard to Fresh Kills, which is used for freight transportation along the West Shore, Staten Island. The branch was built in 1928, in order to serve Gulf Oil along the Arthur Kill, and was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island's western shore to Gulfport. In 1957, the line was extended to <b>Travis</b> in order to serve the newly built Consolidated Edison power plant. In 2005, the <b>Travis</b> Branch was being renovated and was extended from the old Consolidated Edison plant to the New York Sanitation dump at Fresh Kills. Regular service to the facility began in April 2007. A proposed route alignment for light rail on the west shore of Staten Island would have the light rail go on the North Shore rail right-of-way to the <b>Travis</b> Branch of the line, and from there, onto the median of the West Shore Expressway.|$|E

5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to <b>Travis's</b> family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited <b>Travis's</b> estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter. <b>Travis's</b> daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|R
