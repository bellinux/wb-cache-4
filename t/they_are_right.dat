25|$|What is {{generally}} accepted in Buddhism is that effects arise from causation. From {{his very first}} discourse onwards, the Buddha explains the reality of things in terms of cause and effect. The existence of misery and suffering in any given individual {{is due to the}} presence of causes. One way to describe the Buddhist eightfold path is a turning towards the reality of things as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> now and understanding reality directly, although it is debated the degree to which these investigations are metaphysical or epistemological.|$|E

The number of dates prior to announcing an engagement may vary by community. In some, the dating continues several months. In stricter communities, the couple may decide a few days after originally meeting with each other. Also the age when shidduchim start may vary by community. In frum circles, especially among Hassidim, eighteen is the age when shidduchim start and shadchanim take notice.|$|E

Ray collects his children, steals a car and drives to Mary Ann's home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. The next morning, he discovers that a Boeing 747 has crashed in the street. A news team scavenging for food while surveying the wreckage explain that there are multiple Tripods that have attacked major cities including New York City, Paris, Washington, D.C., and London, and have force shields to protect them from human weapons. They also explain that the Martians travelled to Earth within the lightning, as a guise to enter the Tripods. Ray decides to take the kids to Boston to be with their mother. The three are forced to abandon the stolen car after a mob takes it by force. They later survive a Tripod attack which causes a Hudson River ferry to sink. During a desperate battle between U.S. Marines and the aliens, Ray is forced to choose between being separated from Rachel and preventing Robbie from joining the fight; he lets Robbie go with the Marines, who are overwhelmed, thus making Ray presume Robbie died during the attack. While escaping, Ray and Rachel are offered shelter by a paramedic, Harlan Ogilvy, who presumes that the aliens had buried their technology on Earth millions of years ago and has delusions that they can fight against the aliens themselves by observing their operations, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> next to their camp.|$|E
500|$|Sarah {{ends up in}} an oubliette, {{where she}} reunites with Hoggle. After they confront Jareth and escape one of his traps, the two {{encounter}} a large beast named Ludo. Hoggle flees in a cowardly fashion while Sarah befriends Ludo. After another riddle, she loses him in a forest. Hoggle encounters Jareth, who gives him a peach and instructs him {{to give it to}} Sarah, calling his loyalty into question, as he was supposed to lead her out of the maze. Sarah is assaulted by a group of creatures called Fireys with detachable body parts who try to remove her head, but Hoggle comes to her aid. She kisses him, and Jareth magically sends them to the Bog of Eternal Stench as punishment, where they reunite with Ludo. Sarah, Hoggle, and Ludo meet a guard of the bridge out of the swamp named Sir Didymus, an anthropomorphic fox, and his Old English Sheepdog [...] "steed" [...] named Ambrosius. After Ludo howls and summons a trail of rocks to save Sarah from falling into the bog, Didymus joins the group (her three new friends are just like some of the toys in her room). After the group gets hungry, Hoggle gives Sarah the peach and runs away as she falls into a trance and begins to lose her memories. She has a dream where Jareth comes to her at a masquerade ball, proclaiming his love for her, but she begins to remember and escapes, falling into a junkyard. After an old Junk Lady fails to brainwash her and her memory is jogged, she is rescued by Ludo and Didymus, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> outside Goblin City near Jareth's castle. They are confronted by the gate guard, but Hoggle bravely comes to their rescue. Despite his feeling unworthy of forgiveness for his betrayal, Sarah and the others welcome him back, and they enter the city together.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I began to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E

2500|$|Santa Maria Maggiore has a {{large area}} of mosaics, {{probably}} of 432-440.

The apse mosaic is now mostly a Coronation of the Virgin of 1295 by Jacopo Torriti; probably it was originally all composed of the giant foliage scrolls that remain to the upper sides. San Clemente retains a similar apse mosaic, now a reworking of 1299, following the 5th century original. [...] The triumphal arch has the earliest surviving monumental cycle of the Life of the Virgin, dedicatee of the church, and is thought to have been put up by Pope Sixtus III (432-40) to celebrate the Council of Ephesus, where Marian doctrine triumphed over the Nestorians.|$|E
2500|$|In Understanding Christian Muslim Relations he {{discusses}} extensively texts that Christians and Muslims cite {{from both of}} their scriptures to justify their views of the other. He examines texts that support positive, or conciliatory and negative, or confrontational, views. In examining such Qur'anic texts at 9: 5 (cited to justify unprovoked aggression against non-Muslims including acts of terror such as 9/11) and verses cited to justify the oppression of women in Islam (such as Q4: 34-5) Bennett refers to Muslim opinion that interprets the Qur'an's message as permitting only self-defense and as one of gender equality. He suggests that while some Muslims used (and some still use) the Qur'an to justify violence or gender inequality, Muslim voices offering alternative ways to interpret these verses exist and {{have a right to}} be heard. [...] Even if the majority of Muslims understand a text in a certain way, this does not necessarily mean that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> [...] Noorani's comments on Bennett were in the context of discussion of Q9: 5.
