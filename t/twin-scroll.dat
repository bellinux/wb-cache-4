25|$|A turbocharger’s {{performance}} is {{closely tied to}} its size. Large turbochargers take more heat and pressure to spin the turbine, creating lag at low speed. Small turbochargers spin quickly, but {{may not have the}} same performance at high acceleration. To efficiently combine the benefits of large and small wheels, advanced schemes are used such as twin-turbochargers, <b>twin-scroll</b> turbochargers, or variable-geometry turbochargers.|$|E
25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In <b>twin-scroll</b> designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E

50|$|In 2010 Peugeot {{released}} 1.6 THP engine (EP6CDTX) with 200 hp at 5500 RPM, {{maximum torque}} 275 @ 1700 RPM. It featured direct injection, <b>twin-scroll</b> turbocharger and variable valve lift.|$|E
50|$|The 13B-T was {{turbocharged}} in 1986. It {{features the}} newer four-injector fuel injection of the 6PI engine, but lacks that engine's eponymous variable intake system and 6PI. Mazda {{went back to}} the 4 port intake design similar to what was used in the 74-78 13B. In '86-'88 engines the <b>twin-scroll</b> turbocharger is fed using a two-stage mechanically actuated valve, however on '89-'91 engines a better turbo design was used with a divided manifold powering the <b>twin-scroll</b> configuration. For engines manufactured between '86-'88 output is rated at 185 hp (138 kW) at 6500 rpm and 248 N·m (183 lb·ft) at 3500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The N13/N18 engine uses direct injection, a <b>twin-scroll</b> {{turbocharger}} and Valvetronic (variable valve lift).

50|$|The S63 is BMW's Motorsport {{division}} {{version of}} the N63, which debuted in the BMW X6 M. The S63 uses two <b>twin-scroll</b> turbochargers plus a pulse tuned, cross-engine exhaust manifold to keep constant exhaust pulses flowing to the turbos at every 180 degree rotation.|$|E
5000|$|A second Technical Update {{occurred}} in 2016, {{resulting in the}} N63TU2 variants (also known as N63B44O2). The major changes are the use of <b>twin-scroll</b> turbochargers, a wider powerband and the oil/coolant heat exchanger being moved to within the [...] "V" [...] of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Fitted with a {{completely}} new and more powerful 3-litre V6 petrol engine, the S5 has direct injection {{as well as a}} <b>twin-scroll</b> turbocharger to reduce both weight, and cost. The turbocharger is mounted within the engine V and as a result has reduced turbo lag response times.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{with its}} N20 predecessor, the B48 uses a more undersquare design. As per the N20, {{the block and}} head are made from aluminium.

50|$|The N20 {{features}} a <b>twin-scroll</b> turbocharger, {{variable valve timing}} (called VANOS by BMW), variable valve lift (called valvetronic by BMW), direct injection, automatic stop-start and an electric coolant pump. The N20 is sold alongside the smaller displacement BMW N13 turbocharged straight-4 engine. The N20 was placed in Wards Top 10 Engines in 2012.|$|E

Instead of using two small turbochargers like other models in BMW, it uses one large turbocharger with a dual scroll system.|$|E
5000|$|The engine uses {{two small}} {{low-pressure}} turbochargers to minimise turbo lag. The boost pressure is 8.8 psi, because BMW's {{goal was to}} offer the same driving feel as with naturally aspirated engines. BMW's term for turbocharging is [...] "TwinPower Turbo", which has also been applied to the N55, which uses a single <b>twin-scroll</b> turbocharger.|$|E

50|$|The Prince family shares {{its basic}} block {{dimensions}} {{with the previous}} PSA TU engine family. Engineering design was directed by PSA with some support provided by BMW, including their Valvetronic variable valve lift system on the intake side. Other features include on-demand oil and water pumps. Gasoline direct injection with a <b>twin-scroll</b> turbocharger will be used on the higher power versions.|$|E
50|$|The BMW B58 is a {{turbocharged}} {{direct injection}} straight-6 DOHC engine which began production in 2015. It {{was launched in}} the F30 340i. It {{is also part of}} BMW's new modular engine family, which is based on each cylinder comprising 500cc following the B38 and B48 engine. Similar with its N55 predecessor, the B58 also features a single <b>twin-scroll</b> turbo, direct fuel injection, Dual Vanos and Valvetronic.|$|E

Ninety percent of the engine's torque is available from 2000 rpm until redline. A <b>twin-scroll</b> turbo minimizes turbo lag, especially when throttle is applied at over 2000 rpm. The transmission is a six-speed manual. Renault's claimed combined economy is [...]|$|E
5000|$|While its N54 {{predecessor}} uses parallel twin-turbochargers, the N55 uses {{a single}} twin scroll turbocharger. BMW {{has used the}} term [...] "TwinPower Turbo" [...] to describe both twin-turbo and (single turbocharger) <b>twin-scroll</b> systems. Another {{difference is that the}} N55 has variable valve lift (called Valvetronic by BMW). Displacement and peak power output are the same as the N54, however fuel economy is improved 15%, emissions have been reduced, less turbo lag and better low-rev torque.|$|E
50|$|A {{redesigned}} 2.0-L EcoBoost four-cylinder will {{be introduced}} with the second-generation Ford Edge, followed by the 2017 Ford Escape in spring 2016. It features a higher compression ratio than its predecessor (10.1:1 vs 9.3:1) along with <b>twin-scroll</b> turbocharger and fuel and oil systems upgrades. This new engine will deliver more low-end torque than its predecessor and all-wheel drive {{will be available in}} this configuration. It is also expected to tow 3500 lbs in the redesigned Edge and 2017 Escape.|$|E
