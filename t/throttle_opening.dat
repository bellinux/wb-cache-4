25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid {{engine control unit}} (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient {{battery state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce throttle response, reducing the <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
2500|$|Under [...] "normal", {{progressive}} and linear acceleration and deceleration, the DSG shifts in a sequential manner; i.e., under acceleration: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th, {{and the same}} sequence reversed for deceleration. However, the DSG can also skip the normal sequential method, by missing gears, and shift two or more gears. This is most apparent if the car is being driven at sedate speeds {{in one of the}} higher gears with a light <b>throttle</b> <b>opening,</b> and the accelerator pedal is then pressed down, engaging the kick-down function. During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and <b>throttle</b> <b>opening.</b> This kick-down may be engaged by any increased accelerator pedal opening, and is completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the pedal is pressed fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in Manual operation mode. The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.|$|E
2500|$|Turbochargers start {{producing}} boost {{only when}} {{a certain amount of}} kinetic energy is present in the exhaust gasses. Without adequate exhaust gas flow to spin the turbine blades, the turbocharger cannot produce the necessary force needed to compress the air going into the engine. The boost threshold is determined by the engine displacement, engine rpm, <b>throttle</b> <b>opening,</b> {{and the size of the}} turbocharger. The operating speed (rpm) at which there is enough exhaust gas momentum to compress the air going into the engine is called the [...] "boost threshold rpm". Reducing the [...] "boost threshold rpm" [...] can improve throttle response.|$|E
50|$|The {{rationale}} of the split-single two-stroke is that, {{compared to}} a standard two-stroke single, it can give better exhaust scavenging while minimising the loss of unburnt fresh fuel/air charge through the exhaust port. As a consequence, a split-single engine can deliver better economy, and may run better at small <b>throttle</b> <b>openings.</b>|$|R
40|$|Spark {{ignition}} engines {{have many}} advantages, but {{to increase the}} power and efficiency, {{they have a problem}} to set the right ignition timing, at which the maximum power can be achieved. In reality, the optimum ignition timing is immediately prior to, or close to knock (detonation). On the other hand, the value of this optimum ignition timing is dependent primarily on the rotation of the crank shaft and the level of <b>throttle</b> <b>openings.</b> To provide the right timing, it is very difficult if only using mechanical control system as found in conventional engines. So, in this study, a new electro-mechanical method based on Fuzzy Logic Ignition Controller (FLIC) which follows the pattern of the timing in the knock chart was created. In fact the results of the FLIC study, was able to provide correction for each ignition, according to the data on the chart of the optimal ignition timings for all combinations of engine rotations and <b>throttle</b> <b>openings.</b> From the final data recorded, {{it can be said that}} the FLIC able to push the power up to 15 % above normal, while eliminating the knock...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, two-strokes {{have been}} largely {{replaced}} on motorcycles in developed nations due to their environmental disadvantages. Cylinder lubrication is necessarily total-loss and this inevitably leads to a smokey exhaust, particularly on wide <b>throttle</b> <b>openings.</b> Two-stroke-engined motorcycles continue {{to be made in}} large numbers, but mostly low-power mopeds, small scooters and step-through underbones where they still compete strongly with four-strokes (including the highest-selling motorcycle of all time, the 50 cc Honda Super Cub). The major markets of two-stroke motorcycles are in developing nations.|$|R
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full <b>throttle</b> <b>opening,</b> and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E

50|$|The second-generation double VANOS system {{adjusts the}} timing of the intake and exhaust {{camshafts}} with continuously variable adjustment, based on engine speed and <b>throttle</b> <b>opening.</b> The first double VANOS system appeared on the S50B32 engine in 1996.|$|E
50|$|If {{the engine}} is {{operating}} under heavy load at wide <b>throttle</b> <b>openings</b> (such as accelerating from a stop or pulling the car up a hill) then engine speed {{is limited by the}} load and minimal vacuum will be created. Engine speed is low but the butterfly valve is fully open. Since the pistons are descending more slowly than under no load, the pressure differences are less marked and parasitic drag in the induction system is negligible. The engine pulls air into the cylinders at the full ambient pressure.|$|R
50|$|The ECM {{regulates the}} <b>throttle</b> area (<b>opening</b> angle) {{together}} with the turbo wastegate so that the correct torque is attained, i.e. air mass per combustion. Fuel injection is sequential and regulated with air mass per combustion and engine speed as parameters.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{pneumatic}} {{die grinder}} throttles (also called triggers) feature a spring-loaded [...] "kickstand" [...] mechanism between the throttle lever {{and the body}} of the grinder. This prevents the <b>throttle</b> from <b>opening</b> (being pressed down towards {{the body of the}} grinder) without operator intervention and inhibits accidental activation. It is similar in principle to the safety catches used on many handguns.|$|R

50|$|By 1910 the White and Poppe {{carburettor}} {{was used}} by {{a large proportion of}} engine builders for motor boats, motorcars and aero engines. A variable jet provided a constant mixture. The petrol jet orifice and the air supply (<b>throttle</b> <b>opening)</b> were designed to cover the whole range of speeds.|$|E
50|$|Where {{an engine}} may have 60kPa of {{manifold}} pressure at 1800 rpm in an unloaded condition, introducing load with a further <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> {{will change the}} final manifold pressure to 100kPa, engine will still be at 1800 rpm but its loading will require a different spark and fueling delivery.|$|E
50|$|At idle, {{the thermal}} {{efficiency}} is zero, since no usable {{work is being}} drawn from the engine. At low speeds, gasoline engines suffer efficiency losses at small <b>throttle</b> <b>openings</b> from the high turbulence and frictional (head) loss when the incoming air must fight its way around the nearly closed throttle; diesel engines do not suffer this loss because the incoming air is not throttled. At high speeds, efficiency in both types of engine is reduced by pumping and mechanical frictional losses, and the shorter period within which combustion has to take place. Engine efficiency peaks in most applications at around 75% of rated engine power, {{which is also the}} range of greatest engine torque (e.g. in most modern passenger automobile engines with a redline of about 6,000 RPM, maximum torque is obtained at about 4,500 RPM, and maximum engine power is obtained at about 6,000 RPM). At all other combinations of engine speed and torque, the thermal efficiency is less than this maximum.|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} the present study is to clarify {{ignition}} characteristics, combustion process and knock limit of methanol premixture in a dual fuel diesel engine, and also to improve the trade-off between NOx and smoke markedly without deteriorating the high engine performance. Experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance and emission characteristics of direct injection diesel engine operating in duel fuel mode using Pongamia methyl ester injection and methanol carburetion. Methanol is introduced into the engine at different <b>throttle</b> <b>openings</b> along with intake air stream by a carburetor which is arranged at bifurcated air inlet. Pongamia methyl ester fuel was supplied to the engine by conventional fuel injection. The experimental results show that exhaust gas temperatures are moderate and there is better reduction of NOx, HC, CO and CO 2 at methanol mass flow rate of 16. 2 mg/s. Smoke level was observed to be low and comparable. Improved thermal efficiency of the engine was observed...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are {{devices in}} which heat {{is transferred from}} one fluid to another at different temperatures with wide applications in many field of engineering such as power generation, chemical processing, electronics cooling, automotive, refrigeration and air-conditioning. They are classified typically according to type operation, construction and flow arrangement into shell-and-tube, double-pipe, compact, cross-flow, etc. The heat transfer from bank of tubes depends on geometric arrangement, Reynolds number and the position of tube in the bank. However, {{the determination of the}} number of tube rows required to enhance heat transfer {{has been one of the}} major challenge in exchanger design. The aim of this study was to investigate the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics associated with a staggered and in-line tube banks in cross-flow using experimental and numerical methods. The cross-flow heat exchanger (Plint & Partner, Ltd, Workingham, England) was used for the experimentation. During this process, a complete set of test were taken with the heated element in each of the four ranks of tube for ten different <b>throttle</b> <b>openings</b> in the range of 10 - 100...|$|R
50|$|The Ehrlich Motor Company (EMC) was a split single 350 cc {{motorcycle}} engine {{built in}} the UK from 1947 to 1952. After 1948 the engine also was fitted with an oil pump controlled by the throttle, which dispensed two-stroke oil into the fuel at a variable rate depending on <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> (and presumably engine speed/load), {{instead of having to}} pre-mix oil in the fuel.|$|E
50|$|The {{ignition}} timing is also {{dependent on the}} load of the engine with more load (larger <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> and therefore air:fuel ratio) requiring less advance (the mixture burns faster). Also it {{is dependent on the}} temperature of the engine with lower temperature allowing for more advance. The speed with which the mixture burns depends also on the octane rating of the fuel and on the air-fuel ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Throttle bodies {{may also}} contain valves and {{adjustments}} {{to control the}} minimum airflow during idle. Even in those units that are not [...] "drive-by-wire", there will often be a small solenoid driven valve, the Idle Air Control Valve (IACV), that the ECU uses to control the amount of air that can bypass the main <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> to allow the engine to idle when the throttle is closed.|$|E

50|$|When idling, and at low-to-moderate speeds, {{the turbine}} {{produces}} little {{power from the}} small exhaust volume, the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner. When much more power output is required, the engine speed and <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to 'spool up' the turbocharger's turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} changes in engine {{operating}} parameters, i. e., engine speed, throttle and water temperature, for four types of diesel fuel (A, B, C and D) of different specific gravities, as supplied from local market and refineries, were studied and simultaneously optimized.

Also, results of S/N ratio reveal that the throttle has significant influence on brake thermal and exergic efficiencies.

The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual choke control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle, the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|R
5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via the throttle cable, {{to activate the}} throttle linkages, which move the throttle plate.
