5|$|Henry Conwell (c. 1748 – April 22, 1842) was an Irish-born Catholic {{bishop in}} the United States. He became {{a priest in}} 1776 and served in that {{capacity}} in Ireland for more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> After the Pope declined to appoint him Archbishop of Armagh, the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second Bishop of Philadelphia in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and {{spent much of his}} time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated William Hogan, a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his coadjutor bishop, Francis Kenrick. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.|$|E
5|$|He went {{one better}} at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he beat Fernando Meligeni to win the bronze medal, thus {{becoming}} the first Indian to win an individual medal since KD Jadhav won bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> earlier. Paes cited the match {{as one of his}} greatest performances on the court, in part because his wrist was severely injured. He was awarded the highest sporting honour by the government of India, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996. His first successful year in the ATP circuit came in 1993, when he partnered Sébastien Lareau to reach the US Open doubles semifinal. After having a moderate season in 1994, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1995 Australian Open doubles with Kevin Ullyett. From 1996, he partnered with fellow-Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, which would prove to be a winning combination. Their first year was not a very successful one, especially in the Grand Slams, with a round of 32 finish at Wimbledon being the best. 1997 proved to be a much better year for the team of Paes and Bhupathi, with the semifinals of the US Open their best Grand Slam result. Paes climbed the doubles ranking from no. 89 {{at the beginning of the}} year to no. 14 at the end of the year. That year he also made his best singles performance in a Grand Slam, getting to the third round of the 1997 US Open, beating Carlos Costa and Arnaud Boetsch before losing to Cédric Pioline.|$|E

40|$|The decades {{following}} 1970 to {{the present}} were an important period because they marked {{an era in which}} measures such as Affirmative Action were introduced to improve opportunities for American minorities and women. Ironically, this also was a period when income inequality dramatically increased in the United States.

40|$|Europe, {{with its}} 53 {{countries}} and divided history, {{is a remarkable}} but inadequately exploited natural laboratory for studies {{of the effects of}} health policy. In this paper, the first in a Series about health in Europe, we review developments in population health in Europe, with a focus on trends in mortality, and draw attention to the main successes and failures of health policy in the past <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> In western Europe, life expectancy has improved almost continuously, but progress has been erratic in eastern Europe, and, as a result, disparities in male life expectancy between the two areas are greater now <b>than</b> they were <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> ago. The falls in mortality noted in western Europe are associated with many different causes of death and show the combined effects of economic growth, improved health care, and successful health policies (eg, tobacco control, road traffic safety). Less favourable mortality trends in eastern Europe show economic and health-care problems and a failure to implement effective health policies. The political history of Europe has left deep divisions in the health of the population. Important health challenges remain in both western and eastern Europe and signify unresolved issues in health policy (eg, alcohol, food) and rising health inequalities within countries...|$|R

It was that skill that led him to be made commander of several boats that traveled the canal and Pasquotank River, transporting merchandise from Elizabeth City, North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia. The position allowed him to be better fed, shod and dressed. Able to keep a portion of his earnings, Grandy arranged to buy his freedom twice and twice his owners kept the money and held him in slavery. An arrangement was made for an honorable man to buy him and Grandy earned the money to buy his freedom a third time, this time successfully.|$|R

40|$|Zooplankton {{sampling}} {{has been}} conducted biannually off the west and south-west coasts of South Africa since 1988, {{as part of the}} pelagic fish stock assessment cruises covering the continental shelf (0 – 200  m). Previously established relationships between body mass and growth rate were used to derive copepod production. Mean copepod biomass and annual production in the Southern Benguela between 1988 and 2003 were 2. 1  g C m - 2 and 134. 4  g C m - 2  yr - 1, respectively. Biomass and production were higher during summer in four latitudinal areas, but seasonal variability was only significant for the central West Coast. This area, lying downstream from the Cape Columbine upwelling cell, supported the highest levels of copepod biomass (3. 1  g C m - 2) and production (545  g C m - 2  d - 1). Production during winter, when upwelling is minimal, contributed over one third of annual production in all four areas. Copepod biomass, daily production and size composition varied with latitude, season and year, and there were no consistent trends in interannual variability over the study period. Although biomass in the four major EBUS was of the same magnitude (usually - 2), annual production estimates are an order of magnitude greater <b>than</b> those made <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> ago, with highest values for the Southern Benguela...|$|R
40|$|Evidence that {{infectious}} diseases cause wildlife population extirpation or extinction remains anecdotal {{and it is}} unclear whether the impacts of a pathogen at the individual level can scale up to population level so drastically. Here, we quantify the response of a Common eider colony to emerging epidemics of avian cholera, {{one of the most important}} {{infectious diseases}} affecting wild waterfowl. We show that avian cholera has the potential to drive colony extinction, even over a very short period. Extinction depends on disease severity (the impact of the disease on adult female survival) and disease frequency (the number of annual epidemics per decade). In case of epidemics of high severity (i. e., causing > 30 % mortality of breeding females), more than one outbreak per decade will be unsustainable for the colony and will likely lead to extinction within the next century; more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> outbreaks per <b>decade</b> will drive extinction to within 20 years. Such severity and frequency of avian cholera are already observed, and avian cholera might thus represent a significant threat to viability of breeding populations. However, this will depend on the mechanisms underlying avian cholera transmission, maintenance, and spread, which are currently only poorly known...|$|R
