25|$|These {{cetaceans}} {{are highly}} sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain {{between two and}} 25 individuals, {{with an average of}} 10 members. Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to move from pod <b>to</b> <b>pod.</b> Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days be hundreds of miles away from that pod. These pods contain animals of both sexes, and are led by a dominant male. Many hundreds and even thousands of individuals can be present when the pods join together in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total population and is when they are most vulnerable to being hunted.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} {{infection}} <b>to</b> <b>pods</b> above bare soil {{was shown to}} be greater relative <b>to</b> <b>pods</b> above litter. The {{reason for this is}} due to the splash of rain from bare soil spreads the inoculum <b>to</b> <b>pods.</b> However, litter under the tree prevented water droplets from splashing the soil particles as well as the inoculum beneath the litter <b>to</b> the above <b>pods.</b> Further, it was also reported that pods near the ground showed greater infections compared <b>to</b> higher <b>pods</b> due <b>to</b> greater soil was splashed and stick on the lower pods, therefore causes more infections.|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{temperature}} and photoperiod and their interaction on -plant growth and partitioning of dry matter <b>to</b> <b>pods</b> was examined in three selected groundnut genotypes viz., TMV 2, N C Ac 17090 and VA 81 B. The genotypes were grown in six walk-in growth chambers which were programmed to simulate three temperature regimes (22 / 18 °C, 26 / 22 °C and 30 / 26 °C day/night) each under long (12 h) and short (9 h) photoperiods. The plant growth rates and partitioning of dry matter <b>to</b> <b>pods</b> were estimated on a thermal time basis. Plant growth (PLGR) was significantly influenced by tp"" 1 T' 1 P. T::. tJ toperiod and genotype, whereas pod growth rate (PLGR) was primarily by temperature and genotype. The interaction of genotype with photoperiod and with temperature {{was significant for}} both PLGR and PDGR. For example, at the 22 / 18 °C temperature regime, VA 81 B had a high PDGR, while NC Ac 17090 did not even initiate pod growth. The partitioning of dry matter <b>to</b> <b>pods</b> (Pf) was also significantly influenced by photoperiod, temperature and genotype, and significant interactions were found. Photoperiod did not significantly affect Pf under the low temperature regime, but at higher temperatures, partitioning <b>to</b> <b>pods</b> was significantly under short days. Pf of VA 81 B was relatively insensitive to photoperiod compared {{with the other two}} genotypes. study provided evidence of genotypic variability for photoperiod x temperature interactions which could influence adaptation of groundnut to new environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{adaption}} to heat and drought stresses in Phaseolus vulgaris, a grain and vegetable crop widely grown {{in both the}} Old and New World. Substantial genotypic differences are found in morphophysiological characteristics such as phenology, partitioning, plant-water relations, photosynthetic parameters, and shoot growth, which are related to reproductive responses. The associations between (a) days <b>to</b> <b>podding</b> and leaf water content and (b) the number of pods per plant and seed yield are consistent across different environments and experiments. Leaf water content is maintained by reductions in leaf water potential and shoot extension in response to heat and drought stress. Heat-tolerant cultivars have higher biomass allocation <b>to</b> <b>pods</b> and higher pod set in branches. These traits {{can be used as}} a marker to screen germplasm for heat and drought tolerance. In this paper, we briefly review the results of our studies carried out on heat and drought tolerance in the common bean at the Tropical Agriculture Research Front, Ishigaki, Japan...|$|R

While mitochondrial DNA analyses have verified that P. sicula currently on Mrčaru are genetically very similar to the Kopište source population, the new Mrčaru population of P. sicula was described as having a larger average size, shorter hind limbs, lower maximal sprint speed and altered response to simulated predatory attacks compared to the original Kopište population. These population changes in morphology and behavior were attributed to [...] "relaxed predation intensity" [...] and greater protection from vegetation on Mrčaru.|$|E

5000|$|Having sold 106,000 {{copies in}} its first week, Payable on Death debuted at #9 on the Billboard Top 200 chart on the {{strength}} of the first single and music video for [...] "Will You".

The album's relatively poor sales compared to P.O.D.'s mammoth success, Satellite, have been partly attributed to a shakeup at Atlantic Records, leaving P.O.D. with no label support.

50|$|The fires caused {{significant}} damage to rural produce and the harvest was delayed {{for at least}} a week as grains handler CBH Group closed its Esperance grain terminal and shut six grain storage sites. In some areas, the topsoil had reportedly been stripped, leaving nothing but sandy plains. Approximately 4,500 head of livestock died and 30000 ha of crop—constituting an estimated 500,000 tonnes of grain—were destroyed by both the fire and the strong north-westerly winds experienced on 17 November. The winds resulted in significant yield loss due <b>to</b> <b>pod</b> shatter in canola and head loss in both barley and wheat; barley head loss in the order of 1.5 to over 2 tonnes per hectare was observed in many areas of Esperance shire.|$|E
