40|$|Our {{analysis}} of <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> studies shows {{the extent to}} which researchers have neglected important aspects of <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> design and delivery. The observations are made through an archival {{analysis of}} 58 peer reviewed publications in top tier outlets. Our analysis {{led to the development of}} a generic framework which identified three themes in <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> design – (1) user groups, (2) support models, and (3) technology types – and two themes in <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> delivery – (1) direction of delivery, and (2) executive support level. This paper makes a twofold contribution to <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> research. First, it provides an understanding of <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> functions and the challenges faced by organisations in delivering those functions. Second, it identifies established and emerging areas in the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> field. This archival analysis is the first attempt to systematically analyse the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> literature...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{majority}} of tasks and interactions of daily life and work are dependent on information technology (IT). Thus, any type of malfunction in IT hampers smooth work {{and can lead to}} significant problems. To cope with risky situations, the IT <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> function supports the daily operations of businesses, keeping them running smoothly. The <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> is a fundamentally valuable function for businesses and users because it serves to maintain users’ work efficiency by solving their IT-related problems. Moreover, companies need to thoroughly consider how they best obtain the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> function. Insourcing is a business practice where a company takes back in-house previously outsourced operations. This is a worthy alternative because, as time passes, companies, as well as their needs, change. However, surprisingly few studies focus on insourcing arrangements. The aim of this thesis is to increase understanding about the development of the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> function through insourcing by studying both theoretical and practical insights about the whole <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing process. The research questions are: what are the general requirements {{for the development of the}} <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> function through insourcing? How have the objectives of the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing project been realized in the case company? This thesis consists of two main parts: a literature review and a single-case study. The theoretical part compiles essentials of <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing, including two main subjects: the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> function and execution of insourcing. The empirical part examines and evaluates the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing project at the case company. This company insourced its <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> in the summer of 2015 from an external service provider in the Nordic countries. The development project has been carried out quite recently, and this enables intriguing observations to be made of the whole <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing process and the people who participated in it. The empirical part has been conducted through a text analysis of the project and a questionnaire targeting the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> employees. The findings underline that the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing process includes a starting point, a <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing decision, the implementation of the decision, an evaluation of the results, and plans for the future. The main conclusion drawn from this research is that the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing proved to be a successful move at the case company. This thesis further accentuates that <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> insourcing can offer notable benefits for companies, and offers a viable alternative for organizing and developing the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> function to meet the changing needs of business...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} 20 years ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) has been {{evolving}} {{with the latest}} version published in 2007.

40|$|I {{decided to}} write this master thesis in {{relation}} with my work experience at CSC within the <b>service</b> <b>desk.</b> Working at the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> is a very complete mission {{that has to be}} well understood from analysts in order to reach high performance and thus satisfy users. Because it is the goal of CSC, satisfying customers, I decided to focus on this principle and with the results of my research and work experiences I would like to bring in this thesis some findings and recommendations I came up with in order to optimize the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> quality and to improve the customer satisfaction. In the first chapter, I will mainly describe the work of an analyst at the <b>service</b> <b>desk,</b> and I will define the incident management process. It will help understanding how a <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> works. The incident management process is monitored by many metrics. Some of these metrics are documented {{and some of them are}} not and their impacts are different. We will see on what we should focus our efforts. We will see in the second chapter the impacts of these metrics on performance. Measuring the performance of the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> is important in order to be aware of what should be improved to reach the highest standard of services provided. We will see in the end of this chapter that the most important performance indicator is the customer satisfaction. From this fact, I will bring some findings from seven months of experience within the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> in order to improve the quality of the services and the customer satisfactions. I will focus on what can be implemented from the <b>service</b> <b>desk</b> analysts not from the management. I will also focus on the effects of the steps already taken to improve customer satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) {{provides}} a framework to provide IT related services and the interaction of IT staff with users, and is often related with the British Government’s Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). ITIL offers a set of “best practices” for managing IT services {{and is one of}} the most widely accepted approaches to IT service management in the world. Recently, more and more enterprises implemented a centralized IT service management model based on the ITIL framework. However, even by adopting ITIL, most of the enterprises didn’t improve their IT service management level. Some factors become the barriers to the success of ITIL and ITSM implementation. In some cases, enterprises paid more attention to IT infrastructure setup and operation but neglect the importance of <b>Service</b> <b>Desk.</b> In this study, we first review ITSM, ITIL and <b>Service</b> <b>Desk.</b> Second, we identify a full function of new <b>Service</b> <b>Desk</b> and how to setup a good <b>Service</b> <b>Desk.</b> Enterprises should take proper measures in building a mature <b>Service</b> <b>Desk</b> to ensure successful implementation of ITSM...|$|R
