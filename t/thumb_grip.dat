5000|$|The first USP Compact models {{appeared}} in 1996. These are scaled-down USPs, {{and are available}} in all the same cartridges as the full size version, and additionally the [...]357 SIG. Due to the smaller size of the frame, magazines for the Compact variant may have a handgrip extension to better accommodate the shooter's hand. Standard flat floorplates are also available for the USP Compact magazines. The USP Compact comes standard with a bobbed hammer equipped with a flat rubber external <b>thumb</b> <b>grip.</b> This reduces possible snag from the hammer on a holster or clothing while the pistol is being drawn, but still allows the USP Compact to be cocked from a decocked position {{even in the absence}} of a spurred hammer. This can be done since decocking the weapon does not fully drop the hammer, leaving it in a somewhat [...] "half-cocked" [...] state. The USP Compact cannot be cocked from a dry-fired position as the hammer will be flush to the back of the slide. However, the operator could pull the trigger approximately halfway back in a dry-fired position to put the hammer in a half-cocked state, allowing the hammer to be fully cocked with the thumb. A spurred hammer, similar to the one that comes as standard on the P10, can be installed onto the USP Compact. USP Compact models lack the mechanical recoil reduction system of the larger full sized USP pistols. Instead, a more compact recoil buffering system is composed of a polymer bushing, around the captive recoil spring, which is designed to absorb energy at the end of the slide's travel rearward. This polymer bushing, with an estimated lifespan of around 20,000 rounds, is used instead of the double spring/captive recoil spring/guide rod found in the full sized USP.|$|E

30|$|Evaluation of {{the upper}} {{extremities}} focused on hand and grip function, rather than a description of each malformation; a hand {{was defined as the}} existence of a palm (complete or part of) with more than two fingers. An anatomical pincer grasp was defined as the existence of a functional thumb with opposition, i.e. not necessarily an original <b>thumb.</b> <b>Grip</b> function was defined as any hand with the ability to hold items, regardless of an existing pincer grasp and regardless of where the hand was located on the upper extremity, as long as it served as a gripping tool, which also included a release mechanism. In order to perform a general evaluation of the physical abilities, individuals were grouped in terms of the severity of the total musculoskeletal burden. A major malformation of an extremity was considered when considerable shortening or deformity existed, but limbs with malformation(s) of the fingers or toes only, were not considered as such. Individuals with up to three extremities with major involvement were regarded as one group and those with all four extremities affected by major malformations were grouped together.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{prediction}} of electromyographic (EMG) signals {{associated with a}} variety of motor behaviors could, in theory, serve as activity templates needed to evoke movements in paralyzed individuals using functional electrical stimulation. Such predictions should encompass complex multi-joint movements and include interactions with objects in the environment. METHODS: Here we tested the ability of different artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict EMG activities of 12 arm muscles while human subjects made free movements of the arm or grasped and moved objects of different weights and dimensions. Inputs to the trained ANNs included hand position, hand orientation, and <b>thumb</b> <b>grip</b> force. RESULTS: The ability of ANNs to predict EMG was equally as good for tasks involving interactions with external loads as for unloaded movements. The ANN that yielded the best predictions was a feed-forward network consisting of a single hidden layer of 30 neural elements. For this network, the average coefficient of determination (R 2 value) between predicted and actual EMG signals across all nine subjects and 12 muscles during movements that involved episodes of moving objects was 0. 43. CONCLUSION: This reasonable accuracy suggests that ANNs could be used to provide an initial estimate of the complex patterns of muscle stimulation needed to produce a wide array of movements, including those involving object interaction, in paralyzed individuals...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation evoked by painful and nonpainful mechanosensory stimulation on the lower back. The main objectives were to investigate whether cortical activity can be (1) detected using functional fNIRS, and (2) if {{it is possible to}} distinguish between painful and nonpainful pressure as well as a tactile brushing stimulus based on relative changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ([O 2 Hb] and [HHb]). METHODS: Twenty right-handed subjects (33. 5  ±  10. 7  years; range 20 - 61  years; 8 women) participated in the study. Painful and nonpainful pressure stimulation was exerted with a <b>thumb</b> <b>grip</b> perpendicularly to the spinous process of the lumbar spine. Tactile stimulation was realized by a one-finger brushing. The supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) were measured bilaterally using a multichannel continuous-wave fNIRS imaging system. RESULTS: Characteristic relative changes in [O 2 Hb] in the SMA and S 1 after both pressure stimulations (corrected for multiple comparison) were observed. [HHb] showed only much weaker changes (uncorrected). The brushing stimulus did not reveal any significant changes in [O 2 Hb] or [HHb]. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that fNIRS is sensitive enough to detect varying hemodynamic responses to different types of mechanosensory stimulation. The acquired data will serve as a foundation for further investigations in patients with chronic lower back pain. The future aim is to disentangle possible maladaptive neuroplastic changes in sensorimotor areas during painful and nonpainful lower back stimulations based on fNIRS neuroimaging...|$|E

25|$|The {{first thing}} a fast bowler {{needs to do}} is to grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close {{together}} {{at the top of the}} seam with the <b>thumb</b> <b>gripping</b> the ball at the bottom of the seam. The image to the right shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls – see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Using {{anti-inflammatory}} medicine injection such as dexamethasone acetate (DXA) is {{a common}} treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Iontophoresis and phonophoresis of DXA are two other ways which may help to introduce DXA locally to inflammated tissues. This study has been deigned to compare the effect of iontophoresis and phonophoresis of DXA on the CTS treatment. Materials and Methods : 35 mild or moderate CTS patients (51 affected hands) were randomly assigned {{in one of the}} two experimental: iontophoresis (25 affected hands) and phonophoresis (26 affected hands) groups. Subjects in iontophoresis group received 10 sessions of iontophoresis of % 0. 4 DXA solution (DC, 0. 2 mA/cm 2, 20 min) over the wrist of the affected hands while the other group received 10 sessions of phonophoresis of % 0. 4 DXA jell with pulsed ultrasound (1 MHz, 1 W. cm- 2, 5 min). The strength of hand and thumb grips, paresthesia, pain, motor and sensory distal latency and evoked potential of median nerve were measured before and after intervention and after 4 weeks follow-up. Results: Comparisons of the mean changes showed more increase in hand grip (P= 0. 006) and <b>thumb</b> <b>grip</b> (P= 0. 0002), less pain perception (P= 0. 001), shorter sensory (P= 0. 0001) and motor (P= 0. 0008) distal latency and higher sensory and motor (P= 0. 0001) action potential in the phonophoresis in compared with the iontophoresis group. Conclusion: Our results show that using phonophoresis of DXA is more effective for CTS treatment, than the iontophoresis method. More studies are needed to investigate the role of different parameters used during phonophoresis of DXA in the CTS treatment...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} sensorimotor processing of painful pressure stimulation on the lower back of patients with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation. The main objectives were whether patients with CLBP show different relative changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ([O 2 Hb] and [HHb]) in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) compared to healthy controls (HC). Twelve patients with CLBP (32 ± 6. 1 years; range: 24 - 44 years; nine women) and 20 HCs (33. 5 ± 10. 7 years; range 22 - 61 years; eight women) participated in the study. Painful and non-painful pressure stimulation was exerted with a <b>thumb</b> <b>grip</b> perpendicularly to the spinous process of the lumbar spine. A force sensor was attached at the spinous process {{in order to control}} pressure forces. Tactile stimulation was realized by a one-finger brushing. Hemodynamic changes in the SMA and S 1 were measured bilaterally using a multi-channel continuous wave fNIRS imaging system and a multi-distant probe array. Patients with CLBP showed significant stimulus-evoked hemodynamic responses in [O 2 Hb] only in the right S 1, while the HC exhibited significant [O 2 Hb] changes bilaterally in both, SMA and S 1. However, the group comparisons revealed no significant different hemodynamic responses in [O 2 Hb] and [HHb] in the SMA and S 1 after both pressure stimulations. This non-significant result might be driven by the high inter-subject variability of hemodynamic responses that has been observed within the patients group. In conclusion, we could not find different stimulus-evoked hemodynamic responses in patients with CLBP compared to HCs. This indicates that neither S 1 nor the SMA show a specificity for CLBP during pressure stimulation on the lower back. However, the results point to a potential subgrouping regarding task-related cortical activity within the CLBP group; a finding worth further research...|$|E
5000|$|On a hip {{throw off}} the right hip (for example), the most common way this throw is taught is to grab the uke's right arm with the left hand. Some styles, however, teach [...] "wrapping" [...] the uke's right arm with the left instead of the grab. Biomechanically, the most {{effective}} method is to grab the right upper arm using a monkey style grip. Using this method, one grips the opponent's left arm using the 4 fingers and the thumb against the palm, (instead of <b>gripping</b> with the <b>thumb</b> against the 4 fingers). The reason for using this grip rather than a normal human gripping action is that the <b>thumb</b> <b>gripping</b> against the 4 fingers is weaker in strength than the grip applied by the 4 fingers and thumb against the palm (as monkeys do when gripping the branch of a tree to swing).

40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether two versions of the posteroanterior (PA) pressure test provide similar stiffness information. Subiects. Twenty subjects were asked to judge the magnitude of five stiffness stimuli provided by a mechanical device. Methods. Subjects were required to rate the stiffness magnitude on a five-point scale using both the thumb-grip and pisiform-grip versio~ls of the PA pressure test. Using signal detection theory methods, measures of both a subject's ability to discriminate between the stiffness stimuli and a subject's bias in perceived stiffness magnitude due to the testing method were obtained. These values were compared using analysis of trend within an analysis of variance framework. Results. The two methods of performing the PA central pressure had similar stimulus discriminability. With the thumb-grip method, however, a substantial bias occurred, making the mechanical stimuli appear to be stiffer than when the pisiform grip was used. Conclusion and Discussion. The method of performing the PA central pressure test affects the perceived magnitude of stiffness stimuli. This result suggests that the two versions of this clinical test should not be used interchangeably. [Maher C, Adams A. A comparison of pisiform and <b>thumb</b> <b>grips</b> in stiffness assessment.
