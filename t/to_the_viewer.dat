5|$|At the left, {{five men}} eye the six dancing women. Three {{of the men}} discuss their choice of women, while the other two watch the dancing group alone. The male figure closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> a seated black man, had {{previously}} appeared as a soldier in The Triumph of Cleopatra. A sixth man has made his choice, and lunges forward to grab {{the arms of a}} bare-breasted dancing woman.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love {{intentionally}} {{presents a}} moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes {{the same argument}} as that presented by Comus, that it is rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.|$|E
50|$|As the {{characters}} are already known <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewers,</b> <b>the</b> expectations could be huge. The film was mainly shot in Chennai and Kochi.|$|R

50|$|The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and paradoxical. These subgenres {{describe}} the mechanism {{through which the}} artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion <b>to</b> encourage <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt <b>to</b> inspire <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements {{in ways that are}} contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> expectation in order <b>to</b> encourage <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.|$|R
5|$|The {{events of}} the episode {{primarily}} deal with Lord Eddard Stark's investigations into {{the death of the}} previous Hand. In the city of King's Landing, the Tourney of the Hand comes to an end while the various factions that plot for power are revealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> This delicate balance is undone when news arrives that Tyrion Lannister has been arrested by Catelyn Stark. The title of the episode refers {{to the fact that the}} Starks, whose sigil is a wolf, may soon be at war with the Lannisters, whose sigil is the lion.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E

5|$|The Dawn of Love, {{also known}} as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth. Loosely based on a passage from John Milton's 1634 masque Comus, it shows a nude Venus leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this The Dawn of Love {{is one of his}} more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present a challenge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> mirroring the plot of Comus, in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel with his back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
5|$|The {{thirteen}} episode series premiered in Japan on MBS on April 4, 2013 and {{was subsequently}} licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Hanabee Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by MVM Entertainment in the United Kingdom for English home video releases. A manga adaptation was serialized in Monthly GFantasy between December 2012 and October 2014. A light novel prequel was also published by Kodansha Box. In addition, two supplementary books and three Drama CDs {{along with a}} host of other merchandise were released. Critics praised the series for its dark animation styles and backgrounds. However the majority of reviewers had mixed feelings towards the cast of characters since they felt that while the characters were either not appealing or developed enough, their deaths were impactful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b>|$|E

50|$|If {{a bishop}} is a diocesan bishop, it is {{customary}} {{for him to}} combine his arms with {{the arms of the}} diocese following normal heraldic rules. This combining is termed marshalling, and is normally accomplished by impalement, placing the arms of <b>the</b> diocese <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> left (dexter in heraldry) and <b>the</b> personal arms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer's</b> right. In Germany and Switzerland though, quartering is the norm rather than impalement.|$|R

25|$|The woman's pearl {{necklace}} probably {{relates to}} pearls as ancient symbols of virginity, according to Cant. There is no {{source for the}} light on her dress, perhaps indicating that she is lit by an inner illumination — a strong indication <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> {{that she is not}} to be considered an individual, but a symbol, according to Walter Liedtke.|$|E
25|$|A bird volant {{faces the}} dexter with its wings spread in flight (usually shown addorsed and elevated) and its legs tucked under its body. Volant En Arrière {{is when the}} bird is shown from a {{top-down}} perspective with the head facing straight ahead, its back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> and the wings spread in flight (usually shown displayed and inverted). A bird volant is considered in bend ("diagonal") as it is flying from the lower sinister to the upper dexter of the field.|$|E
25|$|This used tiny microcapsules {{filled with}} {{electrically}} charged white particles suspended in a colored oil. In early versions, the underlying circuitry controlled whether the white particles {{were at the}} top of the capsule (so it looked white <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer)</b> or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known electrophoretic display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.|$|E
