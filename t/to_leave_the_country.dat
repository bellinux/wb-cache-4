5|$|Henry Kissinger {{observed}} in his Vietnam War memoir that the Ford Administration was astonished and shamed {{by the fact}} that top Cambodian officials refused <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> These included Premier Long Boret and Lon Non, the Prime Minister's brother, both of whom were on the Khmer Rouge's advertised death list.|$|E

5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to Romania, {{and that he had}} these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> along {{with the fact that he}} was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} forced {{hundreds of}} people <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for the United States.

50|$|Emihamn is a {{database}} of passenger lists compiled from police records for Swedish emigrants departing from major Swedish ports between the years 1869-1950. Almost all emigrants were required to register with the port police prior <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>The</b> register generally includes the passenger's name, occupation/title, age {{at the time of}} emigration, birthplace or place of residence, county, destination, and date of emigration, among other information. It is useful as a resource for genealogists who know their ancestor's name and date of emigration, but do not know the ancestor's birthplace.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Larry {{would finally}} be arrested {{and not be}} able to post bail when drugs were found in his mansion. This led Larry <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> But was caught in 1985 in Portugal. With the Criminal Justice Act in place, it would make life harder for drug -traffickers. As a result, by the mid-1980s, the {{majority}} of the Dunnes were in prison or fled.|$|R

His belt buckle, however, stopped the bullet and he escapes the building.|$|E
5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving {{his head}} like a Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu had decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E
5|$|In the 1800s–1900s, the Lutheran State Church {{supported}} the Swedish government by opposing both emigration and preachers' efforts recommending sobriety. This escalated {{to a point}} where its ministers even were persecuted by the church for preaching sobriety, and the reactions of many congregation members to that contributed to an inspiration <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> (which however was against the law until 1840).|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} the novel {{is the significance of}} the developing Cold War for post- colonial India. The British are resigned <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> but are desperate to have an influence on India's future, in particularly by averting the threat of a [...] Communist takeover. The Royal Indian Navy Mutiny had been a stark reminder of Communist mutinies in the October Revolution and in [...] post-World War I Germany.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} of Jewish {{refugees from the}} Displaced Persons camp {{in which they were}} held (one million persons classified as [...] "not repatriable" [...] remained in Germany and Austria) to Palestine was illegal on both sides, as Jews were not officially allowed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> of Central and Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union and its allies, nor were they permitted to settle in Palestine by the British.|$|R

5|$|On 24 December 1962, UN {{troops and}} Katangese gendarmes clashed near Élisabethville and {{fighting}} broke out. After attempts {{to reach a}} ceasefire failed, UN troops launched Operation Grandslam and occupied Élisabethville, prompting Tshombe <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> A ceasefire was agreed soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from regrouping. Gradually, the UN overran {{the rest of the}} Katanga and, on 21 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of Kolwezi, effectively ending the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|Schmidt had {{secretly}} been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees {{ever since the}} Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933. When she eventually tried <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> on 28 June 1939, Sicherheitsdienst (SD) agents arrested her at the Dutch border and took her to Gestapo headquarters. Once there she was seen by Walter Schellenberg, who at that time worked in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. He gave her an ultimatum: cooperate with the Nazis or be sent to a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} in 1962, the Red Sox {{had been in the}} middle of a streak of 8 losing seasons.

Conley was denied his request because he did not have a passport. Nonetheless, Conley did stay away from the team for 3 days.|$|E
2500|$|In autumn 1984, the Portuguese {{authorities}} declared Trifa an undesirable, {{and indicated}} that {{he had failed to}} reveal his fascist sympathies when requesting and obtaining a temporary visa. According to Reuters, Portuguese officials indicated that [...] "it was against Portugal's interests for Archbishop Trifa to live here and he must leave as soon as possible." [...] Initially, they allowed the prelate three months <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> territory. Trifa contested the decision with the Supreme Administrative Court, which put off his actual deportation for several years.|$|R

5|$|Bond {{proceeds}} to the enclave, {{where he is}} met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist. Bond meets Solomon Adeka and realises that the leader will shortly die of cancer: his mission to kill Adeka is needless. Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment coming into the country, all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck; the aeroplanes all show the AfriKIN name on the fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{on one of the}} supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die.|$|E
5|$|By late March the Embassy {{began to}} reduce the number of US {{citizens}} in Vietnam by encouraging dependents and non-essential personnel <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> by commercial flights and on Military Airlift Command (MAC) C-141 and C-5 aircraft, which were still bringing in emergency military supplies. In late March, two or three of these MAC aircraft were arriving each day and were used for the evacuation of civilians and Vietnamese orphans. On 4 April a C-5A aircraft carrying 250 Vietnamese orphans and their escorts suffered explosive decompression over the sea near Vung Tau and made a crash-landing while attempting to return to Tan Son Nhut; 153 people on board died in the crash.|$|E

5|$|Discrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal {{throughout}} much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of the right to}} practise. Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.|$|E
5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions.

Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.|$|E
30|$|Argentina {{was facing}} a context of {{progressive}} normalization of Institutions, with enough chances {{for a change of}} direction in order <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country’s</b> neoliberal orientation behind, which had been so dominant in the nineties.

A new macroeconomic structure was emerging, offering a new context for production which had already began to go through significant changes along previous decades due to new technical developments that had caused an impact in the agricultural sector. We had a global context where new economic opportunities were envisioned in terms of development.|$|R
