5|$|Chicago and Indianapolis {{are the two}} closest cities, geographically, to {{ever play}} in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are {{slightly}} closer <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, {{at the end of}} the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.|$|E
5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E

25|$|Passenger {{transportation}} was revolutionized by {{the electric}} trolley. Thomas Davenport demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} the electric railway in Springfield in the late 1870s. In 1889 the city's first line was constructed and by 1905 Springfield had more track <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City. The lines provided rapid, cheap transportation for farm produce and workers, created land booms in suburbia, and permitted Sunday outings in the country. They were highly profitable and the base of numerous fortunes.|$|E
25|$|Cuba {{also had}} Latin America's highest per capita {{consumption}} rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios during this period. Cuba had the fifth-highest number of televisions per capita in the world, and the world's eighth-highest number of radio stations (160). According to the United Nations, 58 different daily newspapers operated in Cuba during the late 1950s, more than any Latin American country save Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Havana was the world's fourth-most-expensive city at the time, and had more cinemas <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> Cuba furthermore had {{the highest level of}} telephone penetration in Latin America, although many telephone users were still unconnected to switchboards.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} rainfall {{in the history of}} the United States has occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. On April 5, 1926, a rain gauge in the San Gabriels collected one inch in one minute. In January, 1969, more water fell on the San Gabriels in nine days <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City sees in a year. In February 1978, almost a foot of rain fell in 24 hours, and, in one blast, an inch and a half in five minutes. This storm caused massive debris flows throughout the region, one of them unearthing the corpses in the Verdugo Hills Cemetery and depositing them in the town below. Another wiped out the small town of Hidden Springs in a tributary of the Big Tujunga River, killing 13 people.|$|E

[...] Vaughan is known for avoiding the clichés of the superhero genre, locating the group in Los Angeles rather <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, where most Marvel Comics superhero titles are set. In order to create an everyday setting and tone, Vaughan included various references to current popular culture, including television series, films, events and celebrities.|$|E
500|$|In 1919–1920, Adler, {{despite his}} own socialist politics, {{found himself in}} a labor dispute with the Hebrew Actors' Union; he played that season in London rather <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> A stroke in 1920 while vacationing in upstate New York nearly ended his acting career, {{although}} he continued to appear occasionally, usually as part of a benefit performance for himself, often playing Act I of The Yiddish King Lear: the title character remains seated throughout the entire act. In 1924, he was well enough to perform in the title role of a revival of Gordin's The Stranger, inspired by Tennyson's [...] "Enoch Arden": the character is [...] "a sick and broken man", so the Adler was able to integrate his own physical weakness into the portrayal. However, March 31, 1926, he collapsed suddenly, dying almost instantly.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} room, Greenfield and fellow speechwriter Adam Walinsky {{worked on a}} formal {{response}} to the King assassination with assistance over the phone from Ted Sorenson in New York City. (The original address prepared for the Cleveland City Club, a campaign piece on the economy meant to win the support of local business owners and Democratic Party officials, was dispensed with.) Sorenson's memory differed in that he recalled receiving a call from Kennedy {{at his home in}} Washington D.C, rather <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> on the night of April 4. Kennedy asked for Sorenson's thoughts on a speech being prepared for his appearance in Cleveland and said he would call back within the hour. Sorenson, mindful of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, quickly began writing notes on scrap pieces of paper. When Kennedy called back, Sorenson dictated what he had produced and the senator transcribed it. Mankiewicz later recalled being [...] "occasionally" [...] involved in the drafting process.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers were {{critical}} of Too Much Too Soon {{for what they}} felt was a poorly recorded and overproduced sound. In a negative review for NME, Nick Kent said it sounded cluttered and [...] "shot through with unfulfilled potential", while Circus magazine panned the record as [...] "cut after cut of annoying screeching". It was nonetheless voted the tenth best album of 1974 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in The Village Voice. Willis, one of the critics polled, listed it as her fifth favorite record of the year. Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, named it third best, and in a decade-end list for The Village Voice, he named it the fourth best album of the 1970s. Los Angeles Times critic Richard Cromelin included it in his list of favorite records from the decade and wrote that Morton's production made it slightly better <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Dolls.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Statistics from 1940 {{show about}} 100 murders {{per year in}} Harlem, [...] "but rape is very rare". By 1950, {{essentially}} all of the whites had left Harlem and by 1960, much of {{the black middle class}} had departed. [...] At the same time, control of organized crime shifted from [...] Italian syndicates to local black, Puerto Rican, and Cuban groups that were somewhat less formally organized. [...] At the time of the 1964 riots, the drug addiction rate in Harlem was ten times higher <b>than</b> the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City average, and twelve times higher than the United States as a whole. Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. Property crime was pervasive, and the murder rate was six times higher <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> average. Half of the children in Harlem grew up with one parent, or none, and lack of supervision contributed to juvenile delinquency; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate among young people increased throughout <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, but was consistently 50% higher in Harlem <b>than</b> in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City as a whole.|$|R

500|$|While {{many parts}} of Rocket Science are {{completely}} fictitious, {{a number of the}} story's details are lifted directly from Blitz's own experiences. In several scenes of the film, Hal is trying to ask for a slice of pizza but cannot say the word [...] "pizza"; this is drawn from Blitz's experience of trying to order a hamburger from hotel room service without being able to say the word [...] "hamburger". Hal's first debate scene is based on Blitz's first debate, where, for a full eight minutes, he could only make the sound [...] "agh", and the scene in which Hal throws a cello through a window was inspired by Blitz's own destruction of a flute. While Blitz grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey, he chose to set the narrative in Plainsboro, New Jersey—a place he has never visited—because it was closer to Trenton, rather <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City. He found it humorous that the characters referred to Trenton as the [...] "Big City" [...] and that Plainsboro seemed to orbit around a dead city, Trenton, in comparison to New York.|$|E
500|$|Too Much Too Soon {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{a review of}} the album for Rolling Stone, Dave Marsh hailed the New York Dolls as the leading hard rock band in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's competent drumming, Johansen's ability to add depth to his characters, and Thunders's innovative guitar playing. Marsh especially praised his playing on [...] "Chatterbox", calling it [...] "a classic", and believed even the most brazen songs sounded successful because Morton's production highlighted the group's more unrefined musical qualities. Writing for Creem magazine, Christgau said the polished sound reproduction preserved the band's raw qualities, {{especially in the case of}} Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and remarked that Rundgren [...] "should be ashamed—Shadow Morton has gotten more out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any but their best nights." [...] Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times felt Too Much Too Soon was a better-produced album that proved the band to be [...] "the real thing", calling it the best record of derisive punk rock since Exile on Main St. by the Rolling Stones in 1972. In The New Yorker, Ellen Willis wrote that she learned to appreciate Too Much Too Soon more <b>than</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Dolls after seeing the band perform songs from the former album in concert, particularly [...] "Human Being" [...] and [...] "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from Phonograph Record magazine said the group's [...] "easy going ironic sensibility" [...] was expressed [...] "far more amusingly and accessibly" [...] here than on their debut album.|$|E
