5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone <b>to</b> <b>soil</b> saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E

In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage <b>to</b> <b>soil</b> structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E

40|$|Virus {{adsorption}} <b>to</b> <b>soils</b> {{is considered}} <b>to</b> {{be the most}} important factor in removing viruses after land treatment of wastewater. Most of the studies on virus adsorption <b>to</b> <b>soils</b> have utilized poliovirus as the model system. In the present study, comparative adsorption of a number of different types and strains of human enteroviruses and bacteriophages <b>to</b> nine different <b>soil</b> types was studied. Under the experimental conditions of this study, greater than 90 % of all viruses adsorbed to a sandy loam soil except echovirus types 1, 12, and 29 and a simian rotavirus (SA- 11), which adsorbed to a considerably lower degree. A great deal of variability was observed between adsorption of different strains of echovirus type 1, indicating that viral adsorption <b>to</b> <b>soils</b> is highly strain dependent. Of the five phages studied, f 2 and phi X 174 adsorbed the least. In addition to being dependent on type and strain of virus, adsorption was found to be influenced also by type of soil. Thus, soils having a saturated pH of less than 5 were generally good adsorbers. From these results, it appears that no one enterovirus or coliphage can be used as the sole model for determining the adsorptive behavior of viruses <b>to</b> <b>soils</b> and that no single soil can be used as the model for determining viral adsorptive capacity of all soil types...|$|R

5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} is generally poor due to high temperatures, sedimentation, and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region. Most of these problems are created by human activity; forests and riparian zones have been cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, and high road densities cause slope failures. Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes <b>to</b> <b>soil</b> erosion.
