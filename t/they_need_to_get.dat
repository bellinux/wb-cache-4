25|$|At the Corleone compound, Michael tells Dominic {{a senate}} {{committee}} is building a case against the family and has acquired a key witness - Frank Pentangeli, who survived the assassination attempt, believing he had been betrayed by Michael. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is no longer Corleone consigliere, as he is now Michael's lawyer, and Michael wants him removed from Corleone operations. As such, he is to be Dominic's consigliere. Hagen tells Dominic <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a senator on their side; Pat Geary (Chris Edgerly), who has a weakness for prostitutes, and frequents a local brothel. They set Geary up so he awakens with a dead prostitute, and Tom and Dominic promise him the girl will disappear, {{as long as he}} offers his friendship to the Corleones. Geary agrees, advising Dominic the Mangano family are planning to start operating in Miami.|$|E
25|$|After {{the group}} reels with shock and grief, Rick tells a heartbroken Maggie, still {{suffering}} from pregnancy complications, that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{her to the}} Hilltop Colony's doctor. However, Maggie insists they all head back to Alexandria and prepare to fight. Rick counters, saying they will all die if they go after Negan and his army. The group insist on continuing to the Hilltop, but Maggie demands they do not follow her. Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) volunteers to escort Maggie to the Hilltop to recover, along with the bodies of Glenn and Abraham. As a walker slowly approaches, Rick picks up his axe and joins {{the others in the}} RV. Saddened, Rick has a vision of his entire group, including Abraham and Glenn as well as Maggie's yet-born child, enjoying a peaceful outdoor meal together in Alexandria, before coming back to reality. Through the right hand side view-mirror, Rick sees the walker eating the leftover blood remains of Glenn as he drives away.|$|E
25|$|For marching band, schools {{compete against}} other {{schools in the}} same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into seven areas for Class 5A and 6A schools, and five areas for Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A schools. All schools of all classes compete in region {{competition}} annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Class 4A and Class 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 5A can advance from region to area and state. In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, {{whether it be a}} 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs {{to make it to the}} Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.|$|E

500|$|The {{fourth season}} of the American serial drama {{television}} series Lost commenced airing on the ABC network in the United States, and on CTV in Canada on January 31, 2008, and concluded on May 29, 2008. [...] The season continues the stories {{of a group of}} over 40 people who have been stranded on a remote island in the South Pacific, after their airplane crashed there more than 90 days prior {{to the beginning of the}} season. According to Lost executive producers/writers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, there are two main themes in the fourth season: [...] "the castaways' relationship to the freighter folk" [...] and [...] "who gets off the island and the fact that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back". The fourth season was acclaimed for its flash-forwards, pace and new characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{zones in}} The Legendary Axe consist of {{different}} environments; {{they range from}} dark forests to caverns to mountain plateaus to fortresses. Players will face many enemies along the way which <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through: [...] "frog men" [...] that leap from the water and spit fire; jumping and rolling amoeba creatures in the caverns; [...] "rock men" [...] that spring out and attack on the mountain plateaus; and giant spiders that shoot webs at players. The bosses in the game are guardians of Jagu's cult and are fought {{at the end of}} each zone. They include the following: at the end of Zone1, a pair of possessed grizzly bears; of Zone2, a magical boulder; of Zone3, a group of flying slinky-type monsters called [...] "Aqua Lungs"; and of Zone4, a pair of creatures with shields and spears called [...] "Punjabbis". Zone5 culminates with a maze of rooms called the [...] "Pits of Madness" [...] which feature every enemy encountered up to that point plus some new enemies; at its end is a fire-throwing cult demon. Zone6 consists of the final battle with Jagu himself.|$|E
2500|$|... 14-3-3 {{proteins}} {{also contribute}} to the autoinhibition. As 14-3-3 proteins are all known to form constitutive dimers, their assemblies have two binding sites. Thus the dimer acts as a [...] "molecular handcuff", locking their binding partners at a fixed distance and orientation. When the precisely positioned twin 14-3-3 binding motifs are engaged by a single 14-3-3 protein dimer (such as 14-3-3 zeta), they become locked into a conformation that promotes autoinhibition and does not allow the disengagement of the autoinhibitory and catalytic domains. This [...] "lockdown" [...] of c-Raf (and other Rafs as well as KSRs) is controlled by motif phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated 14-3-3 associating motifs do not bind their partners: <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> phosphorylated on conserved serines (Ser 259 and Ser 621) first, by other protein kinases. The most important kinase implicated in this event is TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and the enzymes dedicated for removal of these phosphates are the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes.|$|E

The magazine also developed a very active audience of people telling the team at PCWeek [...] "about their experiences, good and bad, as they worked with the products". So PCWeek was also able to evolve with feedback from their active readers.|$|R

50|$|It {{was common}} {{at this time}} and in later European history that monasteries would be founded with patrons, usually rich nobles or feudal lords, who would provide the {{financial}} capital <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> create and sustain the monastery, and in return the monks would pray for the salvation of these patrons. Many feudal lords wished to do this, because they felt that <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the monks <b>to</b> pray for them, or else they wouldn't be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> heaven.|$|R
