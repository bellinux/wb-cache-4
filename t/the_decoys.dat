5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt {{to pick out the}} warhead as <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea {{is to reduce the}} individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>decoy</b> effect, a {{model of}} {{consumer}} behavior, hypothesizes that {{the introduction of a}} carefully constructed "decoy " into a choice set will result in a segment of consumers shifting their choice to a higher priced targeted item. <b>The</b> <b>decoy</b> is a high-price, low-value product compared to other items in the choice set.

5000|$|When deployed, <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> is towed {{behind the}} host aircraft, {{protecting}} the aircraft and its crew against RF-guided missiles by luring the missile toward <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> {{and away from}} the intended target. In both flight tests and actual combat, the ALE-50 has successfully countered numerous live firings of both surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. U.S. military pilots have nicknamed <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> [...] "Little Buddy".|$|R
5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
25|$|Another tactic is {{pretending to}} pass the ball, called 'dummying'. It can be used during normal backline play {{or as part of}} a set move. The aim of the dummy is to confuse the {{opposition}} and create a gap for the player carrying the ball. When used as a set move a player will run as a decoy, usually at a different angle {{to the rest of the}} players. In complicated moves there will be multiple players acting as decoys. Care must be taken to ensure <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> do not impede the tacklers, which would result in a penalty being awarded to the defenders.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of the Perverted-Justice website consists of online volunteers who carry out sting operations posing as children or teenagers (the age range chosen for <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> is 10–15) on chat sites and waiting for adults to approach them. After obtaining identifying information of adults posing as minors, who may offer their telephone numbers and other details so that meetings can be arranged, the organization passes the information on to law enforcement. Perverted-Justice's methods are controversial, {{and a number of}} critics have labeled these actions harassment and possibly legal entrapment. The site additionally attracted media attention, both laudatory and critical, {{as a result of their}} collaboration with Dateline NBC on a series of televised sting operations called To Catch a Predator.|$|E
5000|$|Modern decoys are {{typically}} made from molded plastic; {{that began in}} <b>the</b> 1960s. Making <b>decoys</b> of plastic, decoys can be made many times faster than carving from wood. The plastic allows {{a high level of}} detail, a resilient product and reasonable cost. Most are still hand painted. Most modern decoys are fitted with a [...] "water keel" [...] which fills with water once <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> is immersed in water or a [...] "weighted keel" [...] filled with lead. Both types of keel help <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> stay upright in wind or high waves. Weighted keel decoys look more realistic by sitting lower in the water.This also allows for decoys to be thrown into the water and <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> to float upright. The obvious drawback to weighted keels are the added weight when carrying decoys for long distances. Decoys are held in place by some type of sinker or weight and attached via line to <b>the</b> <b>decoy.</b> Various weight designs allow the line to be wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> when not in use and secured by folding or attaching the lead weight to <b>the</b> <b>decoy.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} {{increased}} competitiveness in marketing calls for new analysis and decision methods and tools. This paper describes an agent-based-model simulation of <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect for studying consumer behaviour towards insurance service products. We propose {{a model that}} takes both the price-quality tradeoffs of the insurance services (including <b>the</b> <b>decoy)</b> and <b>the</b> influence of the social network of the consumers. The model is integrated in our existing agent-based-model framework {{for the study of}} insurance consumer behaviour. Experimental results show that the proposed model and its implementation constitute a first step for simulating <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect and for identifying the best price-quality trade-off of <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> when promoting insurance services against each other...|$|R

25|$|After leaving Fort Kearny {{with his}} infantry, Fetterman fired volleys {{at the small}} group of Indians who harassed his flanks and taunted his soldiers. Instead of turning east to where the wagon train was under attack, he {{advanced}} northward up Lodge Trail Ridge, perhaps planning to circle east toward the wagon train, perhaps drawn by the Indian decoys, who mooned him. At the top of the ridge, in violation of orders from Carrington, he chose to follow the Indian decoys north rather than turn east to rescue the wagon train. He advanced along a narrow ridge leading to a flat area along Peno Creek. His cavalry under Grummond took the van, moving at a walk so the infantry could keep up. <b>The</b> <b>decoys</b> led him onward, the cavalry leaving the infantry behind.|$|E
500|$|From {{intelligence}} intercepts {{it appears}} that German forces in the Pas de Calais region reported an invasion fleet. In addition, {{there are reports of}} <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> being fired on by shore batteries in that area. In an 11 June report on the operations, Lieutenant Commander Ian Cox (who was in charge of deception units) indicated that German forces had been convinced by the fake radio traffic. Intercepted dispatches from Hiroshi Ōshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, made reference to the naval deceptions. An 8 June dispatch referred to the Calais region and stated [...] "an enemy squadron that had been operating there has now withdrawn".|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{strategy}} of an evader using a decoy, against a pursuer in a planar engagement scenario, is considered. <b>The</b> <b>decoy</b> launch angle (decoy heading) and decoy launch time are the decision variables.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> (or attraction) effect is amplified when {{participants}} anticipate having to justify their choices to an external audience. We report here two experiments examining the impact on <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect of making future regret possibilities salient, a manipulation that has been shown in several earlier studies to generate pressure to examine and improve one 2 ̆ 7 s decision process. Experiment 1 showed that making regret salient eliminated <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect in a personal preference task. Experiment 2 replicated this finding for a different personal preference task and for a prediction task. It also replicated previous findings that external accountability demands exacerbated <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect. We interpret both effects in terms of justification demands, but to different audiences. Seeking justification to others (responding to accountability demands) exacerbated <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect; seeking justification to oneself (responding to regret salience) eliminated it. The earlier 2 ̆ 7 intuitive politician 2 ̆ 7 metaphor describes responses to demands for external justification. We propose here an alternative, the 2 ̆ 7 intuitive penitent 2 ̆ 7, driven by thoughts of possible later regret to justify her choices to herself. These justification ideas both contribute to a theoretical account of <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect and offer an effective debiasing procedure for it...|$|R
500|$|Decoys are {{lighter than}} the RV, so they will suffer higher {{atmospheric}} drag as they begin to reenter the atmosphere. This will eventually cause the RV to move {{out in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>decoys.</b> But the RV can often be picked out earlier by examining the threat tube as a whole and watching for objects that have lower deceleration. This process, known as atmospheric filtering, or more generally, decluttering, will not provide accurate information until the threat tube begins to reenter the denser portions of the atmosphere, at altitudes around [...] Nike-X intended to wait until the decluttering was complete, meaning the interceptions would take place only seconds before the warheads hit their targets, between [...] away from the base.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} decoy towns were {{constructed}} in Somerset in World War II to protect Bristol and other towns, at night. They {{were designed to}} mimic the geometry of [...] "blacked out" [...] streets, railway lines, and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, to encourage bombers away from these targets. One, on the radio beam flight path to Bristol, was constructed on Beacon Batch. It was laid out by Shepperton Studios, based on aerial photographs of the city's railway marshalling yards. <b>The</b> <b>decoys</b> were fitted with dim red lights, simulating activities like the stoking of steam locomotives. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by {{the first wave of}} Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location. The Chew Magna decoy town was hit by half a dozen bombs on 2 December 1940, and over a thousand incendiaries on 3 January 1941. The following night the Uphill decoy town, protecting Weston-super-Mare's airfield, was bombed; a herd of dairy cows was hit, killing some and severely injuring others.|$|E
2500|$|The US also favoured the Poseidon, {{although}} for more technical reasons. They felt {{that while the}} decoy approach was useful against near-term ABMs deployed by the USSR, that it was considerably less useful against [...] "point defence" [...] type interceptors. This is because <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> are so much lighter than warheads; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> would slow more than the warheads and thus [...] "declutter", allowing the warheads to be attacked. This would require a much faster-reacting system than a long-range interceptor, one that could safely wait until only {{a few moments before}} detonation, but this was by no means impossible and was part of the US's own ABM systems.|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISITwo {{experiments}} {{examined the}} impact on <b>the</b> <b>decoy</b> effect of making salient the possibility of post-decision regret, a manipulation that {{has been shown in}} several earlier studies to stimulate critical examination and improvement of decision process.

2500|$|The IFE {{was built}} in two primary parts. One warhead was mounted {{directly}} {{to the front of}} the second stage, as had been the case for all three warheads in the original Polaris.

2500|$|About {{one-half}} mile after Fetterman {{had crossed}} the summit of Lodge Trail Ridge, <b>the</b> <b>decoys</b> gave a signal and the Indians {{on either side of}} the trail charged. Fetterman's infantry took up a position among some large rocks and in hand-to-hand fighting, he and 49 of his men died. Their bodies were found in a small circle, huddled together for defense. A few of the cavalry were with Fetterman, but Grummond and most of the cavalry apparently were a mile ahead of the infantry, near the flat along Peno Creek and possibly chasing other decoys. When attacked, the cavalry retreated uphill and southward, toward Fetterman and Fort Kearny. Civilians Wheatley and Fisher and several cavalrymen, [...] "knowing it was fatal to retreat from Indians", halted and took shelter among several large rocks, where they were killed. Grummond and the cavalry apparently remained in good order, leading their horses and presumably firing at the Indians all around them. Because of the steepness of the hill and the ice and snow, the Indians were slowed in their attempt to come in close quarters with the cavalry. Still the warriors, mostly on foot, approached within a few feet of them. Grummond probably was killed at this point, after he had personally decapitated at least one warrior with his saber before being overwhelmed by the others. The cavalry continued its retreat, halting to fight in a flat area on the ridge 400 yards north of where the infantry lay dead. The Indians sniped at the soldiers while organizing a charge and then rushed in among the soldiers, killing them all.
