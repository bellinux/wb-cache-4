5|$|<b>The</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog {{was first}} {{described}} as Rana aurea by Lesson in 1827. It has changed classification 20 times; {{it was first}} named Litoria aurea in 1844 by Günther, and changed another 9 times before being named again as Litoria aurea. The specific epithet aurea derived from the Latin aureus for 'golden'. The species is now classified within the Litoria aurea complex, a closely related group of frogs in the Litoria genus. This complex is scattered throughout Australia: three species occur in south-east Australia, one in northern Australia, and two in Southwest Australia. The complex consists of <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog (L. aurea), growling grass frog (L. raniformis), yellow-spotted bell frog (L. castanea), Dahl's aquatic frog (L. dahlii), spotted-thighed frog (L. cyclorhyncha) and the motorbike frog (L. moorei). The ranges of L. raniformis and L. castanea overlap with <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog; this, {{as well as physical}} similarities, may make it difficult to distinguish between the species, and until 1972, L. raniformis and <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog were regarded as the same, when electrophoretic studies proved them to be distinct. The tablelands bell frog has not been seen since 1980 and may now be extinct, although the large yellow spots present on its thighs help distinguish it from <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog. The growling grass frog, which is very similar to <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog, can only be readily distinguished by raised bumps on the dorsal surface. It has also been proposed that some populations of L. aurea located near Ulong, New South Wales, be a separate subspecies, L. a. ulongae, but this was not accepted.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog is {{native to}} {{south-eastern}} Australia. Before its decline in population, its distribution ranged from Brunswick Heads, in northern New South Wales, to East Gippsland, in Victoria, and west to Bathurst, Tumut and the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog survives in {{some areas}} of Sydney, such as the Brickpit at Sydney Olympic Park (the {{proposed}} site for the tennis courts for the 2000 Sydney Olympics). When <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog was found there, the tennis courts were built elsewhere, and the population has since been monitored. This frog has become an unofficial mascot for the Homebush Bay area. It has also been introduced to places in Sydney in its natural habitat, without much success.|$|E

5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|In captivity <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog {{is known}} to feed on crickets, fruit flies, maggots, silkworms, {{domestic}} flies, beetles, mealworms, larvae, slaters, cockroaches, molluscs, plague locusts, spiders, water snails, earthworms, and mice. A case of a small tiger snake being eaten has also been reported. Captive frogs have a habit of not responding to stationary food items, which has helped to form {{the belief that the}} frog will eat most things that move.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. <b>The</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E

5|$|Many {{factors are}} thought to be {{responsible}} for the dramatic decline of this species in Australia, including habitat fragmentation, erosion and sedimentation of soil, insecticides and fertilisers contaminating water systems, the introduction of predatory fish, and alteration of drainage regimes. Population declines are closely related to the introduction of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a species native to North America that was introduced to control mosquito larvae. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the eggs and tadpoles of <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog are extremely susceptible to predation by this fish, and in 77 of the 93 sites in New South Wales where <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog was known to have disappeared before 1990, eastern mosquitofish were found to be present. The frogs have been known to inhabit waters containing the fish, but breeding is rarely successful there, pointing to the fish's voracious eating of eggs and tadpoles. The fish are not yet present in eastern Victoria, where green and golden bell frog numbers have remained solid, but the fish likely will spread to rivers there, possibly inflicting heavy losses on the frogs.|$|E
5|$|Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys until 1926, when they adopted <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> white hooped strip that they have worn ever since.

5|$|The Green was not {{maintained}} at first; after being cleared, it was unkempt and ragged, sloping sharply towards a swamp {{in the southwest}} corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as {{to the future of}} the plot, considering using it for a variety of purposes. In 1828, the Board of Trustees finally voted to plow, seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately; the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836. The main road from Hanover to the northward Lyme, New Hampshire had previously led diagonally across <b>the</b> <b>Green,</b> <b>and</b> due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} for <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> red colours {{that make up}} the background field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog {{can travel}} far {{in a single}} day or night; {{distances}} of 1.0 to 1.5km have been recorded. Tagging experiments have shown that some can move up to 3km in total, and that some travel several kilometres from the closest breeding habitat. However, the species evidently tends to return to or remain at an identified site, provided the habitat stays appropriate for its needs, or else it will move away. <b>The</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog also favours areas with the greatest habitat complexity, and as such, this is a core component of habitat-based strategies to protect the species. In general, the frogs stay within areas of 100–700m2 The frog is well equipped for survival on land. It can rehydrate by absorbing moisture through its ventral skin, and evaporative water loss occurs at a rate, indicative of a watertight skin. very low Some have been observed up to 400m from the nearest body of water.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog {{occurs on}} three islands off {{the east coast}} of Australia: Kooragang and Broughton Islands off Port Stephens, and Bowen Island at Jervis Bay. It was {{introduced}} to New Zealand in the 1860s, and it is now common in the part of the North Island north of Rotorua. In most places, it is the only frog species in the vicinity. However, recent declines have been reported, suspected to be due to predatory fish. It was also introduced to the Pacific island countries of New Caledonia and Vanuatu in the 19th century, and has since become common there.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} green and golden bell frogs are {{estimated}} to have declined by more than 30% in the past 10 years.
