This paper presents a comparison study on the structural properties of monopile and tripod wind-turbine support structures, which are used extensively in offshore wind farms. Both structures have the same upper tower, but different lower structures, one with a monopile and the other with a tripod. Static, fatigue, and modal analyses indicate that both the tripod and monopile structures are feasible in the field, but that the <b>tripod</b> <b>structure</b> is superior to the monopile structure. Static analysis reveals that the location of maximum stress in the monopile structure is different from that in the <b>tripod</b> <b>structure,</b> and that the <b>tripod</b> <b>structure</b> shows higher stiffness and greater stress-control capacity than the monopile structure. Fatigue analysis indicates that the <b>tripod</b> <b>structure</b> has a longer lifetime than the monopile structure. Modal analysis indicates that the two structures exhibit large differences in their natural frequencies. Unlike the monopile structure, the third and first modes both have a substantial influence on the dynamic response of the <b>tripod</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate the effects on tower dynamics when mounting a turbine on a monopile foundation offshore compared to a similar onshore installation. Changes in frequency, modeshapes and damping are investigated including effects of hydrodynamics and nonlinear soil properties. The tool used for the investigation is the new aeroelastic code HAWC 2, {{which is based on}} a multibody formulation. The multibody formulation used in the HAWC 2 code is very generally formulated which means that it can handle any structural object (body) as well as large rotations between the bodies and their associated nonlinear effects. This means e. g. that complex foundation types as very flexible monopile foundations, <b>tripod</b> <b>structures</b> and floating support structures can be simulated in the code. In the present investigation the monopile foundation will be considered. It is possible to apply non-linear springs and dampers on the structure, which are used for soil properties. In the hydrodynamic module of the code the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using Morisons equation.

Experimental and operational modal analysis was applied to identify the dynamic properties of the investigated scale model for intact and damaged state with different excitations and wave patterns.

40|$|In {{this work}} the position-controlled growth of GaN {{nanowires}} (NWs) on diamond {{by means of}} molecular beam epitaxy is investigated. In terms of growth, diamond {{can be seen as}} a model substrate, providing information of systematic relevance also for other substrates. Thin Ti masks are structured by electron beam lithography which allows the fabrication of perfectly homogeneous GaN NW arrays with different diameters and distances. While the wurtzite NWs are found to be Ga-polar, N-polar nucleation leads to the formation of <b>tripod</b> <b>structures</b> with a zinc-blende core which can be efficiently suppressed above a substrate temperature of 870 °C. A variation of the III/V flux ratio reveals that both axial and radial growth rates are N-limited despite the globally N-rich growth conditions, which is explained by the different diffusion behavior of Ga and N atoms. Furthermore, it is shown that the hole arrangement has no effect on the selectivity but can be used to force a transition from nanowire to nanotube growth by employing a highly competitive growth regime.

40|$|Chalcogenide nanocrystals, {{synthesised}} in solution, {{have the}} ability to form larger nanostructures through the association of the nanocrystals. There are a variety of structures that form which range from simple chains to more complex tripod, tetrapod and star morphologies. The association of the nanocrystals has been hypothesised {{to be the result of}} dipole-dipole interactions between nanocrystals. This results partially from the observation of the so called “pearl-necklace” type of structures visible in synthesis preceding the formation of chain structures. The Stockmayer fluid potential, comprising a Lennard-Jones potential with additional dipole-dipole interactions, is employed to model computationally the nanocrystals in a binary mixture, where the sizes of the particles can differ. Monte Carlo simulations are performed at a range of reduced densities and various size ratios. A large range of size ratios are examined, reflecting the size distribution of nanocrystals present in synthesis. There are a number of simple models that can describe the formation of simple chain or ring nanostructures. A significant step forward in the understanding of nanoparticle self-assembly is to model the formation of the more complex tetrapod structures. In this context a modified Stockmayer fluid model is developed in which a single nanocrystal is represented by four off-centre Stockmayer fluid particles. The Stockmayer fluid potential highlights that the formation of linear chain structures is in competition with triangular unit structures, with the energy of the triangular units becoming more favourable with increasing size ratio. The modified Stockmayer fluid model is able to produce good quality tetrapod structures over a narrow range of size ratios. There is also greater formation of <b>tripod</b> <b>structures</b> observed by using a novel analysis technique...|$|R
40|$|After total laryngectomy, voice can be {{restored}} with a silicone rubber tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis. However, biofilm formation and subsequent {{deterioration of the}} silicone material of the prosthesis will limit device life by impairing valve function. To simulate the natural process of biofilm development under dynamic nutrient conditions, a modified Robbins device {{was used to evaluate}} the biofilm-related valve dysfunction of the Groningen, Provox 2, Blom-Singer indwelling, and VoiceMaster voice prostheses. Obstruction of the semicircular slit-valved Groningen prosthesis leading to increased airway resistance was caused not only by a buildup of deposits on the esophageal flange and valve hat, but also by accumulation of deposits on the semicircular valve seating. The hinged flap valved Provox 2 and indwelling Blom-Singer prostheses failed to close sufficiently because of biofilm formation on the valve seating. The esophageal flange of the VoiceMaster prosthesis was affected, but the <b>tripod</b> <b>structure</b> of the ball valve was fully colonized up to the titanium sleeve, which interfered with proper valve opening and closure.

40|$|This article {{reports a}} facile {{synthesis}} of Pd-Cu bimetallic tripods with a purity over 90 %. Two requirements {{must be met}} in order to form tripods: i) formation of triangular, plate-like seeds during the nucleation step and ii) preferential deposition of atoms onto the three corners of a seed during the growth step. In this synthesis, these requirements are fulfilled by adding CuCl 2 and KBr into an aqueous synthesis. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the Cu atoms resulting from underpotential deposition could greatly reduce the energy barrier involved {{in the formation of}} triangular seeds with planar defects because of the much lower stacking fault energy (41 mJ·m- 2 for Cu vs 220 mJ·m- 2 for Pd). The Br- ions could strongly bind to the three { 100 } side faces of a triangular seed, forcing the Pd atoms to grow from the three corners of a seed to generate a tripod. When compared with commercial Pd black, the Pd-Cu tripods exhibited substantially enhanced catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of formic acid.

The telescope model includes several different disciplines. First, the optics discipline is represented through a ray-tracing program which takes the system components and predicts the first-order and third-order optics. Next, a thermal subsystem represents the thermal displacement of several telescope parts as they are exposed to different thermal environments.

40|$|The “RNA world” {{hypothesis}} {{rests on}} the assumption that RNA polymerase ribozymes can replicate RNA without the use of protein. In the laboratory, in vitro selection has been used to create primitive versions of such polymerases. The best variant to date is a ribozyme called B 6. 61 that can extend a RNA primer template by 20 nucleotides (nt). This polymerase has two domains: the recently crystallized Class I ligase core, responsible for phosphodiester bond formation, and the poorly characterized accessory domain that makes polymerization possible. Here we find that the accessory domain is specified by a 37 -nt bulged stem–loop structure. The accessory domain is positioned by a tertiary interaction between the terminal AL 4 loop of the accessory and the J 3 / 4 triloop found within the ligase core. This docking interaction is associated with an unwinding of the A 3 and A 4 helixes that appear to facilitate the correct positioning of an essential 8 -nt purine bulge found between the two helices. This, together with other constraints inferred from tethering the accessory domain to a range of sites on the ligase core, indicates that the accessory domain is draped over the vertex of the ligase core <b>tripod</b> <b>structure.</b> This geometry suggests how the purine bulge in the polymerase replaces the P 2 helix in the Class I ligase with a new structure that may facilitate the stabilization of incoming nucleotide triphosphates...|$|E
40|$|The HIV- 1 spike is a trimer of the transmembrane gp 41 and the {{peripheral}} gp 120 subunit pair. It is activated for virus–cell membrane fusion by binding sequentially to CD 4 {{and to a}} chemokine receptor. Here we have studied the structural transition of the trimeric spike during the activation process. We solubilized and isolated unliganded and CD 4 -bound spikes from virus-like particles and used cryoelectron microscopy to reconstruct their 3 D structures. In order to increase the yield and stability of the spike, we used an endodomain deleted and gp 120 -gp 41 disulfide-linked variant. The unliganded spike displayed a hollow cage-like structure where the gp 120 -gp 41 protomeric units formed a roof and bottom, and separated lobes and legs on the sides. The <b>tripod</b> <b>structure</b> was verified by fitting the recent atomic core structure of gp 120 with intact N- and C-terminal ends into the spike density map. This defined the lobe as gp 120 core, showed that the legs contained the polypeptide termini, and suggested the deleted variable loops V 1 /V 2 and V 3 to occupy the roof and gp 41 the bottom. CD 4 binding shifted the roof density peripherally and condensed the bottom density centrally. Fitting with a V 3 containing gp 120 core suggested that the V 1 /V 2 loops in the roof were displaced laterally and the V 3 lifted up, while the core and leg were kept in place. The loop displacements probably prepared the spike for coreceptor interaction and roof opening so that a new fusion-active gp 41 structure, assembled {{at the center of}} the cage bottom, could reach the target membrane...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of {{offshore wind energy}} in Europe, {{a large number of}} piled structures are being installed. In areas with sandy seabed conditions, erosion of sediment by the actions of wave and current can negatively influence foundation capacity. An accurate prediction model of scour around the piles is therefore required. Well-accepted scour prediction methods exist; both for the equilibrium scour depth and the time scale of scour [1] around single piles. These standard formulas have been combined with metocean data and a hindcasting model to calculate the expected scour depth around piles of wind turbine tripod foundations. Other causes of scour, such as pile-pile interaction, effect of proximity of structural members to the seabed, and seabed mobility were also assessed {{in order to determine the}} amount of global scour to be considered. The scour predictions were compared to measurements taken at an offshore wind turbine foundation at Park Alpha Ventus (PAV) in the German North Sea [2]. The data showed very good agreement with the measured scour around the piles. Both the equilibrium scour depth and time scale of scour were well predicted using the hindcasting model. The measured scour below the central column of the <b>tripod</b> <b>structure</b> exceeded expectations; this is believed to be due to a pumping effect during storm episodes. Finally, the effect of scour on the vertical effective stress around the tripod piles was assessed with a finite element model. Local scour had an important effect while scour below the centre of the structure had a much more limited effect. Considering the combined effects of multiple pile interaction, scour below the central column, and making an allowance for seabed mobility, an equivalent global scour depth for pile capacity calculations was established...|$|E

Once completed, there is a brief pause and the riders are then launched up the tower (Space Shot) then slow just before reaching the top. This is the first feeling of weightlessness that the riders experience.

Once at the top the cart locks into the brakes and is held there giving the riders just enough time to view both the Dallas and Fort Worth skylines.

The riders are then bounced halfway up the tower and dropped again until they are slowly brought back down to be unloaded.|$|R

40|$|Assuring uniform {{reliability}} levels across various {{system configurations}} is {{the intent of}} design standards based on the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) methodology. One such design standard for offshore wind turbines developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission {{was based on the}} European experience and may not necessarily represent conditions suited for U. S. waters where several offshore wind energy projects are being planned. It is, hence, of interest to investigate how uniform is the reliability of offshore wind turbines under various levels of wind and wave loads. We assess the reliability of bottom-supported offshore wind turbines in ultimate limit states associated with the fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline. We compare reliability index estimates for different characteristic load definitions and assumed coefficients of variation for wind and wave loads, as well as for various hydrodynamic to aerodynamic load influences. Effectively, such variations serve to describe different sites and turbine designs. Since large-diameter monopile support structures are dominated by inertia forces, while jacket or <b>tripod</b> support <b>structures</b> with smaller diameter members are dominated by drag forces, we extend an available combined wind-wave load effect model for offshore wind turbines, to include both drag and inertia forces. We show that reasonably uniform reliability levels may be achieved for various combinations of wind and wave loads.
