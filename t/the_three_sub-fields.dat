The system first segments implicitly a date image into sub-fields through the recognition process {{based on an}} HMM approach.

40|$|Risk {{analysis}} is an evolving field. An ever {{increasing number of}} publications by {{a wide range of}} national or international bodies as well as by individual authors address the issues related to risk assessment, risk management or risk communication. Many of these publications include glossaries, terminology, and other term lists that are intended to clarify the particular meaning attached to a term. Such glossaries are occasionally at variance with each other. Whereas minor differences may have their value when referring to a specific context, ambiguous terminology may give an impression of confusion and may lead to misunderstanding. A typical example is provided by the terms &quot;risk analysis &quot; and &quot;risk assessment&quot;. Whereas it is increasingly accepted that the term risk {{analysis is}} the encompassing term used to describe <b>the</b> <b>three</b> major <b>sub-fields</b> of <b>the</b> discipline (risk assessment, risk management and risk communication), many individuals still use the terms risk analysis and risk assessment synonymously. Considering the above, the Working Party on &quot;Harmonisation of Risk Assessment Procedures &quot; identified the need to agree on definitions as far as possible. The aim was to have a common glossary of terms compiled for all Scientific Committees which, as far a...|$|R

40|$|This brief article {{examines}} the scholarship of propaedeutics, which is involved when teasing meaning from cutting-edge scientific and technological fields that are often in flux. Because these fields are plagued with uncertainty, mired in shifting jargon, highly controversial, and often politicized, the scholar who studies these areas must build texts in order to approach the claims and counterclaims made by proponents and opponents and offer rhetorical critical insight. The term fringe science is used to describe <b>three</b> <b>sub-fields</b> {{that have been the}} subject of work by the author and his team. Nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and geo-engineering are three highly interdisciplinary technological fields that offer many opportunities for rhetoricians of science and technology as well as pose risks. To critique them demands a basic understanding of what they are and what they purport to be...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{study of}} {{foundations}} of data mining {{may be viewed}} as a scientific inquiry into the nature of data mining and the scope of data mining methods. There is not enough attention paid {{to the study of the}} nature of data mining, or its philosophical foundations. It is evident that the conceptual studies of data mining as a scientific research field, instead of a collection of isolated algorithms, are needed for a further development of the field. A three-layered conceptual framework is thus proposed, consisting of the philosophy layer, the technique layer and the application layer. Each layer focuses on different types of fundamental questions regarding data mining, and they jointly form a complete characterization of the field. The layered framework is demonstrated by applying it to <b>three</b> <b>sub-fields</b> of data mining, classification, measurements, and explanation-oriented data mining. 1. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Three</b> <b>sub-fields</b> of <b>the</b> colour field were {{explored}} – the warm {{part of the}} spectrum, i. e. yellow / brown and red. (The cold section was dealt with in Peprník 1996.) First, the repertories of the colour terms (CTs) found in each of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> subfields are listed, with their frequencies and a summary of their contexts. In the heading, e. g. “Yellow 9 / 46 ”, the first figure refers {{to the number of}} different CTs found in the work of a particular author and the second figure refers to the total number of occurrences (e. g. 9 different CTs in a total of 46 instances). Three “non-colour ” words are registered. Sunburnt in the subfield of “brown ” and the verbs and nouns blush and colour in the subfield of “red ” (as verbs they are synonymous to turn red and to redden). The noun colour is included when referring to human complexion (usually its changes due to an emotion, especially embarassment, but also is a symptom of health in lightskinned persons) – in that case it is actually synonymous with various degrees of rosy, pink, red and is found in such contexts as her heightened c., her face rose in ~, ~ came to her cheeks, she changed ~, the ~ on her cheeks spread, her face assumed ~, with an angry ~ on her cheeks, her ~ rose / came up / returned, the wind increased her ~, put / bring ~ to a p. ’s cheeks, have a high ~. In the scores of colour, verb and noun are distinguished: e. g. colour 15 (3 + 12) means 3 instances of the verb and 12 instances of the noun. The other neutral terms (hue, tinge) that may refer to the colouring of the complexion are not included (e. g. the ardent hue of his face, the flush on her cheek changed to a lesser hue, her countenance had deepened its tinge, her complexion grew richer in hue, etc.). They are fairly rare and their exclusion will not affect the overall statistical data. Next comes a section with analysis. First, it focuses on individual items (huma...|$|R

40|$|International actors from International Organizations, Western States, Think tanks, risk {{management}} consultancies, NGOs, and private security companies understand borderless threats like clandestine migration, drug trafficking, and international terrorism to emanate from ‘ungoverned spaces’ in the Global South. The Sahelian sub-region of West Africa {{has taken a}} prominent place in global discourses of insecurity and borderless threats. These non-traditional security concerns have been translated into an expanding array of transnational governance initiatives that bring together the activities and practices {{of a wide range}} of state and non-state, global and local, and public and private actors in efforts to deal with the challenges that borderless threats are assumed to present. This dissertation argues that attempts to govern drug trafficking in the Sahel are producing global assemblages of security intervention: shifting, multi-scalar, institutional orders that reorient and reconfigure the security practices, knowledges, mentalities, technologies, and priorities of multiple sets of governance actors across disparate jurisdictional spaces. The effects of the transnationalized security governance and capacity-building initiatives that unfold in simultaneous, connected spaces of intervention amplify and alter positions of social power and prominence in local fields of conflict. Through the practices and projects of global security experts and capacity-builders in the Sahel, new forms of international capital are introduced and become realized in local settings that intensify rivalries between local, national, and regional security institutions over the question of the recognition of their authority over security matters. In their relationships with international capacity-builders and other global actors, sets of local recipients of security governance interventions practice forms of extraversion whereby their structural positions of dependence and differentials of power and resources are leveraged to accumulate forms of international capital that they then use to dominate the fields of power in which they are embedded. <b>The</b> dissertation examines <b>three</b> components of <b>the</b> assemblages of security intervention in West Africa: the effects of the transnational field of capacity- building in the Sahelian interior; the establishment and operation of the UNODC Airport Communications drug interdiction project (AIRCOP) at Dakar’s International Airport, and the joint UNODC/World Customs Organization Container Control Programme operating at the port of Dakar. It advances new empirical material from these case studies, and makes contributions to debates in <b>three</b> <b>sub-fields</b> of International Relations: critical security studies, global governance, and international statebuilding...|$|R
