It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. Her rage is what's causing <b>the</b> <b>storms</b> on the island. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom.

5|$|The 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was an active}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}}, although most of <b>the</b> <b>storms</b> were weak and short-lived. Despite the high activity of weak storms during 2007, {{it was the first}} season to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane, a feat that would not be matched until 2017. It produced 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, sixhurricanes, and twomajor hurricanes. It officially started on June1 and ended on November30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed on May9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December13. The most intense hurricane, Dean, is tied for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall.

5|$|The season {{produced}} 13 named storms, {{slightly below}} {{the average of}} 15named storms per season. However, the season total of nine hurricanes was one above the average, and the total of six major hurricanes surpassed the average of three. Activity during the season was hindered by the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ, which is normally situated south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, shifted northward into Central and Southern Mexico, making the cyclone closer to cooler sea surface temperatures, hence {{limiting the number of}} storms that formed during the season. Although a semi-permanent anticyclone persisted through the summer of 1998, causing most of <b>the</b> <b>storms</b> to remain at sea, some storm did threaten the Baja California Peninsula due to a weakness in the anticyclone.

5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} {{was related}} to a large low-pressure system across the central United States that intensified on February28 while over Kansas, and a cold front moved across the region, providing the lift needed to allow <b>the</b> <b>storms</b> to develop.
