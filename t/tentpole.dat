5|$|The {{successes of}} The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast {{established}} the template for future Disney releases during the 1990s: a musical-comedy format with Broadway-styled songs and <b>tentpole</b> action sequences, buoyed by cross-promotional marketing and merchandising, all carefully designed to pull audiences {{of all ages}} and types into theatres. In addition to John Musker, Ron Clements, Kirk Wise, and Gary Trousdale, the new guard of Disney artists creating these films included story artists/directors Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff, Chris Sanders, and Brenda Chapman, and lead animators Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Eric Goldberg, Nik Ranieri, Will Finn, and many others.|$|E
5|$|The dump {{months are}} what the film {{community}} calls the two periods {{of the year}} when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases. Audiences during these periods are smaller {{than the rest of the}} year, so no <b>tentpole</b> movies are released. January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August and September sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home.|$|E
25|$|Point Break is an American-German-Chinese co-{{production}}. Studio Babelsberg co-produced and oversaw {{production services}} for the film. A script for the remake had been lying around for years, {{but it was not}} until Ericson Core pitched his idea to Warner Bros. that the film actually got off the ground. However, Core's idea for the film was significantly different than the script. His concept was much more of a big <b>tentpole</b> movie, with scenes that defy the laws of physics.|$|E

25|$|Star Trek Beyond underperformed financially {{at the box}} office. Scott Mendelson of Forbes {{observed}} that one factor contributing to the film's underperformance was its untimely release in a crowded summer {{in which it was}} surrounded by other <b>tentpole</b> films like Ghostbusters, Jason Bourne and Suicide Squad. He also noted that had Paramount released the film for the Star Treks 50th anniversary on September 8, the film could have benefited from that occasion, as demonstrated in 2012 when MGM released the James Bond film Skyfall (which went on to gross over $1 billion) for that series' 50th anniversary.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} comes the holiday movie season, when the studios release both <b>tentpole</b> movies, such as the latest {{installments}} in popular franchises that are expected to be highly successful and [...] "Oscar bait" [...] movies that are seen as likely to earn critical praise and, more importantly, nominations for major awards such as the Golden Globes and Oscars, the industry's most prestigious. Those nominations are then used to promote the film. But while the former nominations are announced in December with the awards themselves given in early January, the Academy Award nominations are announced after the Golden Globes, and the actual awards are not given until late February leaving most of the first two months of the year as Oscar season a period during which any Golden Globes received as well as Oscar nominations can be used to promote the film to audiences, while studios lobby Academy members to vote for their nominees.|$|E
500|$|Stan Lee tweeted in February 2010 that Marvel was {{prepping}} {{the film}} and that he met with Wright for lunch to discuss the character. Wright noted {{that there was no}} timetable for the film because Marvel did not consider the character to be one of their bigger, <b>tentpole</b> properties, so [...] "It's more like me and Kevin Feige saying...'Let's make a good script that works, that's all about a great genre film, and that isn't necessarily relying on anything else'". At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright said that Ant-Man would not fit in the chronology of The Avengers due to the origin story he had written not working in the MCU. In January 2011, Wright stated that he had resumed writing the script for the film following the conclusion of the international promotion for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and by April he and Cornish delivered the second draft of Ant-Man to Marvel. At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright revealed a third draft had been handed in.|$|E

50|$|In 1987, {{songwriter}} Howard Ashman {{became involved}} with the writing and development of Mermaid after {{he was asked to}} contribute a song to Oliver & Company. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican Rastafarian crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make Mermaid a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the <b>tentpoles</b> of the film. Ashman and composer Alan Menken, both noted for their work as the writers of the successful Off-Broadway stage musical Little Shop of Horrors, teamed up to compose the entire song score.|$|R
50|$|By 2014, {{having already}} earned a {{reputation}} as a veteran of the superhero genre, Goyer shifted his focus to the independent producing arena, hiring producer Kevin Turen to run his company. Explaining his thinking, Goyer said: “Everybody talks about how it seems like studios increasingly are relying on these big <b>tentpoles</b> and some micro-budget horror films, and that’s the majority of the slate,” Goyer said. “I’ve been a benefactor of that movement, but there are a ton of films out there I’ve really admired {{over the last few years}} that studios aren’t making, and I wanted to see if I could help get more of them made.” In 2015, soon after embracing independent producing, Goyer won a competitive situation to produce the feature version of Miles. Furthermore, he executive-produced Nate Parker's feature Birth of a Nation, which recently sold for a record $17.5 million at Sundance, before sweeping the festival's awards.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2012, Warner Bros. {{moved back}} the release date by nine months, from June 15, 2012, to March 22, 2013. The Hollywood Reporter stated: [...] "Warner can likely afford the move because of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises, {{which opened in}} July. And moving the film back gives the studio more time for special effects, {{as well as a}} chance to attach {{trailers}} for it to Peter Jackson's Christmas <b>tentpole</b> [...] ". In October 2012, Warner Bros. again moved the release date, this time to March 1, 2013, three weeks earlier than the previous date. Warner Bros also changed the title of the film from Jack the Giant Killer to Jack the Giant Slayer.|$|E
2500|$|Among the few {{bright spots}} during this season were the midseason crime dramedy Castle {{as well as}} the success of two family sitcoms that {{anchored}} the network's revamped Wednesday comedy lineup, The Middle and Modern Family, the latter of which was both a critical and commercial success. Shark Tank (based on the Dragon's Den reality format) also became a midseason sleeper hit on Sundays in the spring of 2010; the following season, it became the <b>tentpole</b> of the network's Friday night schedule, gradually helping make ABC a strong competitor (after being paired with 20/20 and beginning with the 2012–13 season, the Tim Allen sitcom Last Man Standing) against CBS' long-dominant drama/reality lineup on that night {{for the first time since}} the [...] "TGIF" [...] lineup ended in 2000.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In 3 DICs heat dissipating {{devices are}} stacked {{directly}} {{on top of}} each other leading to a higher heat density than in a comparable 2 D chip. 3 D integration also moves the majority of active devices further away from the heatsink. This results in a degraded thermal path which makes it more challenging to remove heat from the active devices. Gradient FireBolt was used to perform an appropriate 3 D thermal analysis on a 1024 -point, memory-on-logic 3 DIC FFT processor for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The chip was simulated with a spatial resolution of 80 nm, and was modeled to include the effect of each line of interconnect, as well as each via and fill structure exactly as drawn in the layout. Large isolated temperature spikes were found near groups of clock buffers at the edge of the SRAMs on the middle tier. It was found that lowering the simulation resolution and using composite thermal conductivities failed to accurately predict the location of these <b>tentpoles.</b> I...|$|R
5000|$|Ahead of the 100th episode, Guggenheim {{talked about}} the {{commitment}} to quality the series strived for, stating, [...] "We never skimped on the writing, the production or in the post-process going, This {{is going to be}} one of those stinkers, we might as well cut our losses and move on. We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be." [...] He also noted his biggest regret in the series was [...] "I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these <b>tentpoles</b> at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling. We didnt do things as naturally and as elegantly as we should have." ...|$|R
5|$|That year Clements and Musker {{expanded}} the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating {{the role of}} the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver & Company as more immediate releases. In 1987, songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of Mermaid after he was asked to contribute a song to Oliver & Company.

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in the United Kingdom, United States, France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Spain and Mexico on 15 July 2009. It was originally set to be released on 21 November 2008, but was pushed back by eight months to 17 July, despite being completed. Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn noted that the move was meant [...] "to guarantee the studio a major summer blockbuster in 2009," [...] with other films being delayed due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The box-office success of summer WB films Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and The Dark Knight also motivated the decision. An unnamed rival studio executive told Entertainment Weekly that the move was to [...] "stop next year's profits from looking seriously underwhelming after the phenomenal success of The Dark Knight," [...] as [...] "they don't need the money this year anymore." [...] Dan Fellman, WB head of distribution, said that the studio had considered the date change {{for three to four}} weeks prior to the announcement, but gave it serious consideration a week before they came to their final decision. Three months before its release in July, the date was again changed by 2 days from 17 to 15 July, so it could open on a Wednesday like most <b>tentpole</b> summer movies.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its {{international}} success, Star Trek Beyond {{was met by}} critics who were less taken with the film. Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film 1½ stars out of 4 and he commented that the filmmakers [...] "should have called it Star Trek Into Drowsiness." [...] Smith later added, [...] "Beyond is tepid when it’s trying to be emotional, moronic when it’s trying to be thrilling and unfunny when it’s trying to be non-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module: Things just click into place when needed, as when Kirk commands Scotty to rev up a busted old spaceship, Scott says it’s impossible, and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip." [...] James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave 2½ stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one; The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn’t unexpected; it’s Lin’s trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it’s also instantly forgettable." [...] Dave Robinson of outlet Crash Landed writes that [...] "Star Trek Beyond fails to push beyond its own roots and becomes just another very safe sci-fi popcorn movie in an increasingly crowded market, that will likely have you leaving the theatre feeling exactly as you entered." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ and wrote, [...] "ith Beyond, it feels like just another summer <b>tentpole</b> with not enough going on underneath the tent." ...|$|E
