60|$|My dear Mrs. Martin,--It seems a long {{long time}} since we had any intercourse; and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> last {{pleasant}} letter to Henrietta must go to you from me. We have heard of you that you don't mean to return to England before the spring--which news proved me a prophet, and disappointed me at the same time, for one can't enjoy even a prophecy in this world without something vexing. Indeed, I do long to see you again, dearest Mrs. Martin, and should always have the same pleasure in it, and affection for you, if my friends and acquaintances were as much multiplied as you wrongly suppose them to be. But the truth is that I have almost none at all, in this place; and, except our relative Mr. Kenyon, not one literary in any sense. Dear Miss Mitford, one of the very kindest of human beings, lies buried in geraniums, thirty miles away. I could not conceive what Henrietta had been telling you, or what you meant, for a long time--until we conjectured that it must have been something about Lady Dacre, who kindly sent me her book, and intimated that she would be glad to receive me at her conversations--and you know me better than to doubt whether I would go or not. There was an equal unworthiness and unwillingness towards the honor of it. Indeed, dearest Mrs. Martin, it is almost surprising how we contrive to be as dull in London as in Devonshire--perhaps more so, for the sight of a multitude induces a sense of seclusion which one has not without it; and, besides, there were at Sidmouth many more known faces and listened-to voices than we see and hear in this place. No house yet! And you will scarcely have patience to read that papa has seen and likes another house in Devonshire Place, and that he may take it, and we may be settled in it, before the year closes. I myself think of the whole business indifferently. My thoughts have turned so long on the subject of houses, that the pivot is broken--and now they won't turn any more. All that remains is, a sort of consciousness, that we should be more comfortable in a house with cleaner carpets, and taken for rather longer than a week at a time. Perhaps, after all, we are quite as well sur le tapis as it is. It is a thousand to one but that the feeling of four red London walls closing around us for seven, eleven, or twenty-five years, would be a harsh and hard one, and make us cry wistfully to 'get out.' I am sure you will look up to your mountains, and down to your lakes, and enter into this conjecture.|$|E

6000|$|But again; the Scripture {{tells us}} {{again and again}} that our souls want light from above; and we all know by {{experience}} that the trees and plants which grow on earth want the light of the sun to make them grow. So, doubtless, here again the Scripture example of a tree will hold good. Now what does the sunlight do for the tree? It does every thing, for without light, the soil, and air, and rain, are all useless. It stirs up the sap, it hardens the wood, it brings out the blossom, it colours the leaves and the flowers, it ripens the fruit. The light is the life of the tree;--and is there not one, my friends, of whom these words are written--that He is the Life, and that He is the Light--that He is the Sun of Righteousness and the bright and morning Star--that He is the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world--that in Him was life, and the life was the light of men? Do you not know of whom I speak? Even of Him that was born at Bethlehem and died on the cross, who now sits at God's right hand, praying for us, offering to us His body and His blood;--Jesus the Son of God, He is the Light and the Life. From Him alone our light must come, from Him alone our life must come, now and for ever. Oh, think seriously of this--and think, too, how a short time before He died on earth He spoke of Himself as the Bread of life--the living Bread which comes down from heaven; how He declared to men, that unless they eat His flesh and drink His blood, they have no life in them. And, lastly, consider this, how the same night that He was betrayed, He took bread, and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, [...] "Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me." [...] And how, likewise, He took the cup, and when He had blessed it, He gave it to them, saying, [...] "Drink ye all of this, for this is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins; this do, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me." [...] Oh, consider these words, my friends--to you all and every one they were spoken. [...] "Drink ye ALL of this," [...] said the Blessed One; and will you refuse to drink it? He offers you the bread of life, the sign and the pledge of His body, which shall feed your souls with everlasting strength and life; and will you refuse what the Son of God offers you, what He bought for you with His death? God forbid, my friends! This is your blessed right and privilege--the right and the privilege of every one of you--to come freely and boldly to that holy table, and there to remember your Saviour. At that table to confess your Saviour before men--at that table to shew that you really believe that Jesus Christ died for you--at that table to claim your share in the strength of His body, in the pardon of His blood, which cleanses from all sin--and at that table to receive what you claim, to receive at that table the wine, as a sign from Christ Himself, that His blood has washed away your sins; and the bread, as a sign that His body and His spirit are really feeding your spirits, that your souls are strengthened and refreshed by the body and blood of Christ, as your bodies are with the bread and wine. I have shewn you that your souls must be fed from heaven,-- that the Lord's Supper is a sign to you that they ARE fed from heaven. You pray to God, I hope, many of you, that He would give you His Holy Spirit, that He would change, and renew, and strengthen your souls--you pray God to do this, I hope--Well, then, there is <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> prayers. There your souls WILL be renewed and strengthened--there you will claim your share in Christ, who alone can renew and strengthen them. The bread which is there broken is the communion, the sharing, of the body of Christ; the cup which is there blessed is the communion of the blood of Christ: to that heavenly treat, to that spiritual food of your souls, Jesus Himself invites you, He who is the life of men. Do not let it be said at the last day of any one of you, that when the Son of God Himself invites you, you would not come to Him that you might have life.|$|E

The definitions of sexuality are different from person to person, and there is no right or wrong one. Webster’s dictionary defines sexuality as “the quality of being sexual. ” But what does that mean? Whatever makes you feel like a sexual person is a part of that word’s definition.
