50|$|<b>Tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported nerve entrapment of the ankle and {{is analogous to the}} carpal tunnel of the wrist. People with <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> have pain in the plantar aspect of the foot mostly at night. Weight bearing increases pain and weakness is found on intrinsic foot muscles with positive Tinel sign at the tunnel. There is no tenderness present on the plantar foot, though this is typically the primary site of complaint.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} upon {{physical}} examination findings. Patients' pain history and a positive Tinel's sign are the first steps in evaluating the possibility of <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> X-ray can rule out fracture. MRI can assess for space occupying lesions or other causes of nerve compression. Ultrasound can assess for synovitis or ganglia. Nerve conduction studies alone are not, {{but they may be}} used to confirm the suspected clinical diagnosis. Common causes include trauma, varicose veins, neuropathy and space-occupying anomalies within the tarsal tunnel. <b>Tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is also known to affect both athletes and individuals that stand a lot.|$|E
40|$|SummaryTarsal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TTS) defines an {{entrapment}} neuropathy of {{the posterior}} tibial nerve {{or one of}} its branches, within the <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Numerous etiologies have been described explaining this entrapment, including trauma, space-occupying lesions, foot deformities, etc. We present an unreported cause of a space-occupying lesion in the etiology of TTS, namely {{the combination of a}} hypertrophic long distally extended muscle belly of the flexor hallucis longus and repetitive ankle motion.

In contrast to carpal tunnel syndrome due to one tunnel at the wrist for the median nerve, there are four tunnels in the medial ankle for tarsal tunnels syndrome. If there is a positive Tinel sign when you tap over the inside of the ankle, such that tingling is felt into the foot, then there is an 80% chance that decompressing the tarsal tunnel will relieve the symptoms of pain and numbness in a diabetic with <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

50|$|Given the unclear role of electrodiagnostics in the {{diagnosis}} of <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> efforts {{have been made in}} the medical literature to determine which nerve conduction studies are most sensitive and specific for tibial mononeuropathy at the level of the tarsal tunnel. An evidence-based practice topic put forth by the professional organization, the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine has determined that Level C, Class III evidence exists for the use of tibial motor nerve conduction studies, medial and lateral plantar mixed nerve conduction studies, and medial and lateral plantar sensory nerve conduction studies. The role of needle electromyography remains less defined.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TTS), {{also known}} as {{posterior}} tibial neuralgia, is a compression neuropathy and painful foot condition in which the tibial nerve is compressed as it travels through the tarsal tunnel. This tunnel is found along the inner leg behind the medial malleolus (bump {{on the inside of}} the ankle). The posterior tibial artery, tibial nerve, and tendons of the tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus muscles travel in a bundle through the tarsal tunnel. Inside the tunnel, the nerve splits into three different segments. One nerve (calcaneal) continues to the heel, the other two (medial and lateral plantar nerves) continue on to the bottom of the foot. The tarsal tunnel is delineated by bone on the inside and the flexor retinaculum on the outside.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{peripheral}} nerve or nerve root can be damaged, called a mononeuropathy. Such injuries can {{be because of}} injury or trauma, or compression. Compression of nerves can occur because of a tumour mass or injury. Alternatively, if a nerve is in an area with a fixed size it may be trapped if the other components increase in size, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include pain and numbness in the thumb, index and middle finger. In peripheral neuropathy, the function one or more nerves are damaged {{through a variety of}} means. Toxic damage may occur because of diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), alcohol, heavy metals or other toxins; some infections; autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis. Peripheral neuropathy is associated with a sensory loss in a [...] "glove and stocking" [...] distribution that begins at the peripheral and slowly progresses upwards, and may also be associated with acute and chronic pain. Peripheral neuropathy is not just limited to the somatosensory nerves, but the autonomic nervous system too (autonomic neuropathy).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective:To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{in a sample of}} 200 healthy hospital workers, establishing the respective epidemiological associations. Materials and Methods:Two hundred individuals were submitted to wrist ultrasonography to measure the median nerve area. They were questioned and examined for epidemiological data, body mass index, carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> signs and symptoms, and submitted to the Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire (BCTQ) to evaluate the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> severity. A median nerve area ≥ 9 mm 2 was considered to be diagnostic of carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Results:Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> was diagnosed by ultrasonography in 34 % of the sample.

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine the exact cause of <b>Tarsal</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> It is important to attempt to determine the source of the problem. Treatment and the potential outcome of the treatment may depend on the cause. Anything that creates pressure in the Tarsal Tunnel can cause TTS. This would include benign tumors or cysts, bone spurs, inflammation of the tendon sheath, nerve ganglions, or swelling from a broken or sprained ankle. Varicose veins (that {{may or may not be}} visible) can also cause compression of the nerve. TTS is more common in athletes and other active people. These people put more stress on the tarsal tunnel area. Flat feet may cause an increase in pressure in the tunnel region and this can cause nerve compression. Those with lower back problems may have symptoms. Back problems with the L4, L5 and S1 regions are suspect and might suggest a [...] "Double Crush" [...] issue: one [...] "crush" [...] (nerve pinch or entrapment) in the lower back, and the second in the tunnel area. In some cases, TTS can simply be idiopathic.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{cause of}} <b>Tarsal</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (TTS) {{can vary from}} patient to patient. However the same end result is true for all patients, the {{compression}} of the posterior tibial nerve and it branches as it travels around the medial malleolus causes pain and irritation for the patient. There are many possible causes for compression of the tibial nerve therefore {{there are a variety}} of prevention strategies. One being immobilization, by placing the foot in a neutral position with a brace, pressure is relieved from the tibial nerve thus reducing patients pain. Eversion, inversion, and plantarflexion (as seen in figure 1) all can cause compression of the tibial nerve therefore in the neutral position the tibial nerve is less agitated. Typically this is recommended for the patient to do while sleeping(see figure 2). Another common problem is improper footwear, having shoes deforming the foot due to being too tight can lead to increased pressure on the tibial nerve. Having footwear that tightens the foot for extended periods of time even will lead to TTS. Therefore, by simply having properly fitted shoes TTS can be prevented.|$|E
50|$|There are {{multiple}} ways that tarsal tunnel {{can be treated}} and the pain can be reduced. The initial treatment, whether it be conservative or surgical, depends on {{the severity of the}} tarsal tunnel and how much pain the patient is in. There was a study done that treated patients diagnosed with <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> with a conservative approach. Meaning that the program these patients were participated in consisted of physiotherapy exercises and orthopedic shoe inserts in addition to that program. There were fourteen patients that had supplementary tibial nerve mobilization exercises. They were instructed to {{sit on the edge of}} a table in a slumped position, have their ankle taken into dorsiflexion and ankle eversion then the knee was extended and flexed to obtain the optimal tibial nerve mobilization. Patients in both groups showed positive progress from both programs. The medial calcaneal, medial plantar and lateral plantar nerve areas all had a reduction in pain after successful nonoperative or conservative treatment. There is also the option of localized steroid or cortisone injection that may reduce the inflammation in the area, therefore relieving pain. Or just a simple reduction in the patient’s weight to reduce the pressure in the area.|$|E

5000|$|Foot {{and ankle}} {{surgeons}} {{are trained to}} treat all disorders of the foot and ankle, both surgical and non-surgical. Additionally, the surgeons are also trained to understand the complex connections between disorders and deformities of the foot, ankle, knee, hip, and the spine. Therefore, the surgeon will typically see cases that vary from trauma (such as malleolar fractures, tibial pilon fractures, calcaneus fractures, navicular and midfoot injuries and metatarsal and phalangeal fractures.) Arthritis care (primarily surgical) of the ankle joint and the joints of the hindfoot (tarsals), midfoot (metatarsals) and forefoot (phalanges) also plays a rather significant role. Congentital and acquired deformalities include adult acquired flatfoot, non-neuromuscular foot deformity, diabetic foot disorders, hallux valgus and several common pediatric foot and ankle conditions (such as clubfoot, flat feet, tarsal coalitions, etc.) Patients may also be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon for proper {{diagnosis and treatment of}} heel pain (such as a consequence from plantar heel fasciitis), nerve disorders (such as <b>tarsal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and tumors of the foot and ankle. Amputation and ankle arthroscopy (the use of a laparoscope in foot and ankle surgical procedures) have emerged as prominent tools in foot and ankle care. In addition, more applications for laser surgery are being found in the treatment of foot and ankle disorders, including treatment for bunions and soft tissue lesions.
