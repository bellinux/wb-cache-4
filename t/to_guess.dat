5|$|The {{computer}} game Snuffle The Truffles {{was replaced with}} a parrot themed game Loot The Fruit and Mr Blobby joined the show and was given his own game called Blobby's Baggage which involved viewers having <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> where Blobby had been on holiday.|$|E
5|$|Beta-2 had two builds (beta-2a: 28 February 1996 and beta-2b: 21 March 1996) and {{introduced}} a new API for communicating with other applications. Also, the internal component libwww was updated to version 4. OMRON Corporation developed an internationalized version that could display Chinese, Korean and Japanese characters in one page. OMRON's Arena supports both ISO-2022 and Unicode. It is able <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> the charset parameter automatically if charset parameter isn't specified in Content-Type field.|$|E
5|$|Series 6 {{also saw}} the {{computer}} game Grabbit Rabbit replaced with Kwakatak' - a game' which involved viewers having to guide 'Derek the Duck' around a pond picking up pieces of bread before a goldfish character could get to it first. Mr Blobby's new game became Blob A Job which saw him as a handyman and viewers having <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> which celebrity's house he would be redecorating later on that afternoon.|$|E

30|$|Personal {{information}} such as country of birth and place of birth can be vulnerable <b>to</b> informed <b>guessing.</b> The use of questions {{in the public domain}} can be vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>guessing.</b> It may not be true for all, but traditionally people use a common family and surname. Jobling [31] indicates that from five thousand years ago, fathers have passed their surname to children. The analysis of answers to profile question “Father’s surname” in the learning phase revealed that, 64 % of participants had a common surname as their fathers’ and can be vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> attack.|$|R

5|$|The {{computer}} game for this series became Grabbit Rabbit which involved guiding 'Warren the Rabbit' down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as fences and bushes. Ball later {{said in an}} interview that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners had told her that he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger. Blobby's game also now became known as Blobby's Office Trolley which saw him as a postman for the BBC with viewers having <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> which celebrity a letter was for.|$|E
5|$|The {{spelling}} system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, {{with elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek spelling {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> from knowing how a word is pronounced. There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E

40|$|The 3 -parameter {{model of}} Item Response Theory gives the {{probability}} of an individual (examinee) responding correctly to an item without being sure of all the facts. That is known as guessing. Guessing could be a strategy employed by examinees to earn more marks. The way an item is constructed could expose the item <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> by the examinee. A study on comparison of the Psychometric properties of the Biology Examinations conducted by West African Examination Council and National Examination Council, in the year 2000, identified items that were prone <b>to</b> <b>guessing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, {{gave some}} {{information}} about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The Anglian collection, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however {{referred to in the}} 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great, written {{by a member of the}} religious community at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum, written by Henry of Huntingdon.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E
5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E

Guessing is the action that brings about “a definite solution” (139). here is a definite process <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> in Polanyi's account, although he does tend towards Whewell and Hempel in the comparison he makes between discovering hypotheses and Gestalt perception (144).|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 8, Lyon opened fire on the Alice Dean, {{intending}} to destroy or disable the steamers. The men had only ever fired the cannon at celebratory events and were unsure how to aim it properly. Two shots were fired, with the second one hitting the upper deck of the McCombs, passing through the ship and landing near {{a group of men}} on the shore, wounding a Confederate. Just as the shelling began Provost Marshal John Timberlake arrived on the scene from Corydon with a small company of reinforcements and assumed command. Timberlake, who was a colonel in the regular army, believed Morgan's force was small, and decided to spare the steamships and instead shell the massed cavalry. Before the cannon could be re-aimed, the superior Confederate artillery was set up and returned fire from their significantly higher position {{on the opposite side of}} the river. The dense morning fog in the valley obliged the Confederates <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> at their target. Their first shot landed short of the Legion's position, and the second shot landed behind them and leveled the cabin. The Legion defenders set off a third shot that had already been loaded into their cannon, and fled into a nearby forest. As they moved up the ridge and into the woods, they became visible to the Confederate artillery who began to shell the forest. One shot struck a log where two of the defenders had stopped to rest. They were mortally wounded while the rest fled into the forest as the Confederates continued to shell the landing.|$|E

40|$|Security {{protocols}} {{involving the}} use of poorly chosen secrets, usually low-entropy user passwords, are vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> attacks. Here, a penetrator guesses a value {{in place of the}} poorly chosen secret and then tries <b>to</b> verify the <b>guess</b> using other information. In this paper we develop a new framework extending strand space theory in the context of these attacks to analyze the effect using fingerprint biometrics in those protocols. In particular, we will prove the efficacy of biometrics in preventing some known forms of guessing attacks which differ in the way the guess is verified. Interestingly, our approach shows a remarkable increase in security of selected protocols, subject <b>to</b> off-line <b>guessing</b> attacks. We illustrate these concepts on some examples...|$|R
