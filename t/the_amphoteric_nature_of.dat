This isotherm is typical of ionic surfactant to protein binding. Often the high affinity initial bond appears at very low concentrations of surfactant and therefore in some protein-surfactant systems, the exact shape of the isotherm in this region may be missing.

The {{synthesis}} {{of a new}} diamidoamine ligand, CH 3 N[CH 2 CH 2 NH(3 -(CF 3) C 6 H 4) ] 2 (H 2 L) is reported. Molybdenum complexes of the type X[LMoC 13] (X = Et 3 NH, Bu 4 N) are readily synthesized as purple air and moisture sensitive crystalline solids. They may be alkylated by Grignard reagents to yield the monoalkyl complex LMo(Cl) (CH 2 CMe 3), the alkylidyne complex LMo(CCMe 3) (CH 2 CMe 3) via a,a - elimination of dihydrogen, and the stable complex LMo(CH 2 TMS) 2 (TMS = SiMe 3). LMo(CH 2 TMS) 2 is readily oxidized by cyclohexene sulfide and hexachloroethane to yield, initially, molybdenum alkylidenes that readily undergo decomposition reactions to the bridging sulfide complex {LMoS} 2 and [LMo(CTMS) Cl] 2, respectively. However, the alkylidene complex LMo(CHTMS) (q 2 - MeCCMe) may be isolated if LMo(CH 2 TMS) 2 is heated {{in the presence of}} five equivalents of 2 -butyne. It is a rare example of an alkylidene and alkyne in the coordination sphere of a group six metal. The relationship between oxidation and alkyne binding is discussed. Chapter 2. Early Transition Metal Pyrrolyl Complexes: Structure, Spectroscopy, Hapticity, and Fluxional Processes. (cont.) A review of group 4, 5,and 6 transition metal pyrrolyl complexes is presented.

Synthesis and Characterization of Molybdenum Imido Alkylidene Bis(amide) Complexes. The {{synthesis of}} bis(amide) complexes Mo(NR) (CHR') (X) 2 (R = Ar, Ad, 2, 6 -Br 2 - 4 -MeC 6 H 2 X = N(t-Bu) Ar', NC 4 H 4) from the bis(triflate) complexes Mo(NR) (CHR') (OTf) 2 (DME) (OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate, DME = 1, 2 - dimethoxyethane) is reported. These complexes are of interest as potential precursors for the in situ generation of active and enantioselective metathesis catalysts. The tert-butyl anilide complexes are found to be unreactive towards enantiopure diols. The bis(pyrrolyl) complexes exist in rapid equilibrium between a dimeric form [Mo(NR) (CHR') (NC 4 H 4) 2] 2 and one in which all pyrrolyl resonances are equilibrating rapidly. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the bis(pyrrolyl) complexes was interrogated by variable temperature 1 H and 13 C NMR for R = Ar and Ad.

The bis(pyrrolyl) complexes are found to serve as excellent precursors for the in situ generation of olefin metathesis catalysts at room temperature and millimolar concentration. Furthermore, catalysts not accessible via traditional routes may now be accessed from bis(pyrrolyl) precursors. The bis(pyrrolyl) complexes also react with simple olefins such as ethylene and isobutylene to yield what are proposed to be a bimetallic dimer [Mo(NAr) (NC 4 H 4) 2] 2 and a 2 -propylidene complex via olefin metathesis.

The resulting bio-composites showed an increase in flexural properties and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) compared to composites produced using untreated jute fibres. To understand the reason behind the ILSS improvement, the acid&# 8211;base properties of jute fibres were determined by contact angle analysis using the capillary rise method. The results were fitted further to van Oss-Chaudhury-Good (vOCG) and Chang-Qin-Chen (CQC) models to determine the Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW) and acid-base components of surface energy. Surface energy determined by the vOCG model revealed that plasma treatment of jute fibre resulted in a 22 % increase in total surface energy, a 19 % increase in the LW component and a 24 % increase in the acid-base component of surface energy.

The highest phosphate adsorption capacity was obtained by using Zn-Al- 2 - 300, that is LDHs with Zn/Al molar ratio of 2 and calcined at 300 degrees C for 4 h. Circumneutral and mildly alkaline waters appeared suitable for the possible application of Zn-Al LDHs due to <b>the</b> <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> aluminum hydroxide.

40|$|The sliding {{articular}} cartilage {{surfaces of the}} human diarthrodial joints are surrounded by biolubricating synovial fluid (SF), creating a perfect low friction biological biobearing structure with excellent lubrication and wear resistance, even during motion. Lubrication is predominately provided by surface adhered biomolecules including phospholipids, hyaluronic acid and synovial lubricin. Inflammation, such as arthritis and injury, changes the joint assembly resulting in detachment of essential surface molecules, increasing friction and wear of the sliding {{articular cartilage}}. Changes in the composition and distribution of these surface molecules is suggested to aggravate the disease. The lubricative, heavily glycosylated mucin-like synovial glycoprotein, lubricin, has previously been observed to contain glycosylation changes related to rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Therefore, a structural investigation of lubricin and its glycosylation was initiated {{in order to better}} understand the biolubricating ability of lubricin and its pathological involvement in arthritis diseases. An investigation was undertaken to better understand the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the dominant glycan structure, sialic acid. Sialidase specific for α 2 - 3 linked sialic acid and subsequent UniCarb-DB fragment spectra comparison of the resultant structure indicated the exclusive 3 -linked <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> core 2 sialylation. However, core 1 structures had both 3 and 6 linked sialylation. In arthritis, lubricin has been shown to degrade as identified by its fragments in the synovial fluid. This may open up a new possibility for identification of disease specific biomarker. The mass spectrometric glycopeptide analysis showed that lubricin contains an extended serine, threonine and proline (STP) rich domain composed of imperfect tandem repeats (EPAPTTPK), the target for O-glycosylation. The N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GALNTs) expression analysis of the fibroblast-like synoviocytes showed high expression of the less understood GALNT 5 and 15 in addition to the ubiquitously expressed GALNT 1 and 2. This indicated that lubricin required a unique combination of transferase genes for its glycosylation. Overall, this study revealed that negatively charged sialic acid in the mucin-like domain makes <b>the</b> lubricin molecule <b>amphoteric</b> in <b>nature,</b> as <b>the</b> arginine and lysine rich protein core is positively charged. The number of glycosylation sites and sialylation were shown to be essential for this <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature</b> and may be important for its function as an amphoteric biolubricator...|$|R

Six thioureylenes, {{belonging to the}} group of thiouracil and imidazole, were selected for this work: thiouracil (TU), methylthiouracil (MTU), propylthiouracil (PTU), phenylthiouracil (PhTU), mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) and tapazole (TAP). <b>The</b> <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> these compounds allows their electrospray detection in both positive and negative ionisation. Nevertheless, MS detection is not favoured by their low molecular weights, while their chromatographic retention is also thwarted by their high polarity. A pentafluorophenyl (PFP) core-shell phase column was selected to avoid peak asymmetry or peak splitting, and a dual-polarity ionisation method was optimised to obtain a sensitivity as high as possible. The method was validated according to the Commission Decision 657 / 2002 /EC. A simple and fast procedure based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) was optimised to extract analytes from baby foods with recoveries exceeding 82 %. Limit of decision (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) were lower than the permissible maximum concentration (10  ng g− 1). The validated method was then applied to assess the potential occurrence of the six selected thyreostats in nine commercial products. All the samples were found free of contamination...|$|E

40|$|Several {{metastable}} {{effects have}} been observed in chalcopyrite solar cells. Recently, they have been related to <b>the</b> <b>amphoteric</b> behavior of <b>the</b> Se vacancy. We give an independent experimental evidence on this amphoteric behavior. By comparing charge carrier densities obtained from Hall effect measurements under illumination and in the dark, we conclude that illumination removes compensating donors...|$|R
40|$|Li {{is present}} in {{hydrothermally}} grown ZnO at high concentrations and is known to compensate both {{n- and p-type doping}} due to its <b>amphoteric</b> <b>nature.</b> However, Li can be manipulated by annealing and ion implantation in ZnO. Fast, 20 ms flash anneals in the 900 – 1400 °C range result in vacancy cluster formation and, simultaneously, a low-resistive layer in the implanted part of the He- and Li-implanted ZnO. The vacancy clusters, involving 3 - 4 Zn vacancies, trap and deactivate Li, leaving other in-grown donors to determine the electrical properties. Such clusters are not present in sufficient concentrations after longer (1 h) anneals because of a relatively low dissociation barrier ∼ 2. 6 ± 0. 3 eV, so ZnO remains compensated until Li diffuses out after 1250 °C anneals.
