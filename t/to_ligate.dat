40|$|The {{stability}} and electronic structure of radical attached aluminum nanoclusters are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). A detailed investigation shows good {{correlation between the}} thermodynamic stability of radical attached clusters and {{the stability of the}} attached radical anions. All other calculated parameters like HOMO-LUMO gap and charge transfer are also found to be consistent with the observed thermodynamic stabilities of the complexes. Investigation of the electronic structure of radical attached complexes further shows the presence of jellium structures within the core similar <b>to</b> the <b>ligated</b> clusters. Comparison with available experimental and theoretical data also proves the validity of superatomic complex theory for the radical attached clusters as well. Based on the evaluated thermodynamic parameters, selected radical attached clusters are observed to be more thermodynamically stable in comparison with experimentally synthesized ligated clusters.

40|$|The most {{striking}} effect of Clostridium difficile infection is its degrading of the intestinal barrier. The {{aim of this}} study is to establish whether the cellular or paracellular constituent of the barrier is the initial target of the toxins produced by C difficile. Accordingly, the caecal epithelium of C 3 H/He mice was challenged under three experimental conditions with the C difficile strain VPI 10463 : (1) by in vivo inoculation of axenic mice, (2) by adding the toxins <b>to</b> <b>ligated</b> caeca in vivo, and (3) by adding them to the mucosal side of isolated caeca in Ussing chambers. Under all three conditions, the epithelial barrier was tested in caeca mounted in these chambers. The transepithelial potential difference (PD), electrical conductance (G), and intact and degraded Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fluxes were used as indexes of permeability. Results were as follows: (1) In axenic mice, C difficile caused severe infection, produced toxins A and B, reduced PD, and enhanced G and intact HRP fluxes without changing degraded HRP fluxes, (2) four hours after the toxins were added <b>to</b> <b>ligated</b> caeca in vivo, PD was relatively unaltered, but G, and intact and degraded HRP fluxes increased, and (3) when toxins were added to caeca during two hours in the Ussing chambers, the only modification observed was an increase in degraded-HRP fluxes. These results indicate that the C difficile toxins gradually cause intestinal lesions. After an apparent resistance, they stimulate the endocytotic process and then increase paracellular permeability and finally cause loss of cell viability...|$|R

50|$|The 3A {{assembly}} {{method is}} the most commonly used, as its compatible with assembly Standard 10, Silver standard {{as well as the}} Freiburg standard.

The destination plasmid also have a different antibiotic resistance genes than the plasmids carrying the BioBrick parts. All three plasmids are digested with appropriate restriction enzyme and then allowed <b>to</b> <b>ligate.</b> Only the correctly assembled part will produce a viable composite part contained in the destination plasmid.

50|$|The second total {{synthesis}} of (+)-kalkitoxin was only 16 steps {{and gave a}} 3% overall yield. A major aspect by which this differs from the first total {{synthesis of}} (+)-kalkitoxin is that rather than using a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction <b>to</b> <b>ligate</b> a phosphonate carrying the 4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone, an organocopper conjugate addition reaction was used instead. This was done specifically by connecting the organocopper species to a 4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone carrying an (S)-N-trans-crotonyl group through a 1,4-nucleophilic addition to the α,β-unsaturation of the crotonyl group. This method is advantageous because it allows for stereoselectivity of the resulting 1,3-dimethyl configuration during the larger sequential introduction of the methyl substituents at the C7, C8 and C10 chiral centers.|$|E
