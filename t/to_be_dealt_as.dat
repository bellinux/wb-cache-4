50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the actual nut hand may not be the same as the absolute nut hand; for example, if the board is 7♥ 2♣ K♠ K♥ 3♦ a player with K♣ K♦ has the absolute nut hand. However, any player with K-7 knows that he has the nut hand as it is impossible for another player to have two kings. The phrase may also refer to a hand in progress with cards yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt,</b> <b>as</b> the player can be said to have the nuts at that time. For example if a player holds 7♠ 8♠ on a board of 5♣ 6♠ 9♥ he can be said to have the nuts, however if the next card comes 7♥ then 8-10 becomes the nuts. This makes some nut hands very vulnerable in nine-card games, such as Omaha hold 'em.|$|E
40|$|Big Data is {{a rising}} IT trend similar to cloud computing, social {{networking}} or ubiquitous computing. Big Data can offer beneficial scenarios in the e-health arena. However, {{one of the}} scenarios can be that Big Data needs to be kept secured {{for a long period}} of time in order to gain its benefits such as finding cures for infectious diseases and protecting patient privacy. From this connection, it is beneficial to analyse Big Data to make meaningful information while the data is stored securely. Therefore, the analysis of various database encryption techniques is essential. In this study, we simulated 3 types of technical environments, namely, Plain-text, Microsoft Built-in Encryption, and custom Advanced Encryption Standard, using Bucket Index in Data-as-a-Service. The results showed that custom AES-DaaS has a faster range query response time than MS built-in encryption. Furthermore, while carrying out the scalability test, we acknowledged that there are performance thresholds depending on physical IT resources. Therefore, for the purpose of efficient Big Data management in eHealth it is noteworthy to examine their scalability limits as well even if it is under a cloud computing environment. In addition, when designing an e-health database, both patient privacy and system performance needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>as</b> top priorities...|$|E
