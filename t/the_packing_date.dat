40|$|BACKGROUND:  Incorrect blood {{component}} transfused {{is a frequent}} serious incident associated with transfusion and often involves misidentification of the patient and/or the unit of blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  This study extended the evaluation of an electronic system involving bar code technology and handheld computers. Electronic control of collection of blood from blood refrigerators was incorporated into a previously described process for blood sample collection and blood administration. Practice was evaluated before and after its introduction in cardiac surgery. RESULTS:  The baseline audits revealed poor practice. Significant improvements were found following {{the introduction of the}} electronic system, including from 8 percent to 100 percent in checking that the blood group and unit number on <b>the</b> blood <b>pack</b> matched <b>the</b> compatibility label and <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> was in <b>date</b> (p ≤ 0. 0001). Similar significant improvements were found in blood sample collection, the collection of blood from blood refrigerators, and the documentation of transfusion. Staff found the system easy to operate and preferred it to standard procedures. CONCLUSIONS:  A bar code patient identification system improved transfusion practice, although areas for improvement were identified. These results provide support for further work on the development of such systems for both transfusion and other procedures requiring patient identification...|$|R

There was a remarkable variance in the fungal count and diversity between the studied samples. Eleven species belonging to five genera were isolated on 20 % sucrose-Czapek’s agar medium at 28 °C. Samples of date paste (Agwa) and flesh supplemented with sesame or peanut were highly polluted (650 - 3030 colonies/gs). The genera of highest occurrence and their respective species were Aspergillus (A. niger, A. flavus, A. flavipes, A. ochraceus, A. oryzae and A. terreus); Cladosporium (C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum) and Penicillium (P. chrysogenum). Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the 40 different date samples revealed that 2 out of 5 samples of pitted date fruits stuffed with peanut were contaminated by aflatoxin B 1 (4. 8 and 6. 2 µg/kg). Experimental infection of the different date samples by four isolates of A. flavus as well as A. flavus CMI 89717, the highly aflatoxin-producing strain, indicated that samples supplemented with sesame or peanut were more susceptible for fungal growth and aflatoxin contamination...|$|R

40|$|An {{application}} of statistic techniques for structure evaluation of packing of equal or distributed spherical particles is presented. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> of particles generated by computer simulation is cut {{by a series}} of equally separated parallel planes, and the area densities of the cross-sections of particles on the cutting planes are used to analyse <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> structure.

Then a time series analysis technique is applied to examine the randomness of <b>the</b> <b>packing.</b> <b>The</b> homogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated by testing the hypothesis that the particles are uniformly distributed within <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> space. <b>The</b> isotropy of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated both at micro-level, the distribution of projections of centre-to-centre lines between touching particles, and at macro-level, the variances of area densities on the cutting planes perpendicular to different directions.

500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is liquid and vapor distribution entering <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed. [...] <b>The</b> number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed, <b>the</b> liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed and <b>the</b> required separation will not be achieved. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> will appear to not be working properly.
