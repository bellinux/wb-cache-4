5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> would severely injure <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral {{scales of}} the snake is an anal plate that protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) on the underside near <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> This anal scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|E

50|$|If {{a player}} comes up behind an enemy plane, he may elect to <b>tail</b> <b>the</b> enemy. <b>The</b> <b>tailed</b> player tries {{to break the}} pursuit: each turn he {{secretly}} selects one of 16 possible maneuvers. He may for example climb, dive, turn, bank, loop, stall, barrel roll, go into a tail spin, or perform a falling leaf. <b>The</b> <b>tailing</b> player, meanwhile, is allowed to select some of the possible maneuvers for himself, the exact number depending upon his distance to <b>the</b> enemy. <b>The</b> <b>tailed</b> player then performs his maneuver, and if <b>the</b> <b>tailing</b> player has <b>the</b> maneuver in his selected list, he can duplicate the maneuver and stay on <b>the</b> enemy's <b>tail.</b>|$|R

5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence {{and some are}} {{prepared}} to jettison them to save their lives in {{a process known as}} autotomy. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> and use this strategy readily. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{differentiating}} {{features of}} males and females is the males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted hemipenes).

5|$|The breed {{standards}} of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> and a white tip. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> should feature a reasonable level of brush.|$|E
5|$|The pilots felt a jolt, and the {{autopilot}} disengaged.

5|$|The {{shape of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} described above is {{sustained by the}} neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> plasma sheet, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the magnetopause currents (or Chapman–Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause. These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere. They also interact substantially with the solar wind.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the T4 phage, the {{construction}} of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins.

40|$|A vertical-tail {{model with}} stub {{fuselage}} was tested {{in combination with}} various simulated horizontal <b>tails</b> to determine <b>the</b> effect of horizontal-tail span and location on the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> vertical <b>tail.</b> Available theoretical data on end-plate effects were collected and presented in the form most suitable for design purposes.

5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line on the edge of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tail</b> club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tail</b> is {{moderately}} {{short and}} does not have large thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>tails</b> of {{gravitational}} waves {{are caused by}} scattering of linear waves onto the space-time curvature generated by the total mass-energy of the source. Quite naturally, <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of tails are caused by curvature scattering of <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of waves themselves. <b>The</b> <b>tails</b> of tails {{are associated with the}} cubic non-linear interaction between two mass monopole moments and, dominantly, the mass quadrupole of the source. In this paper we determine the radiation field at large distances from the source for this particular monopole-monopole-quadrupole interaction. We find that <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of <b>tails</b> appear at <b>the</b> third post-Newtonian (3 PN) order beyond the usual quadrupole radiation.

5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E
5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once {{thought to have}} been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> from side to side.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that conditional heteroskedasticity thickens <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of <b>the</b> unconditional distribution of an error term relative to its conditional distribution. To {{what extent do}} imperfect forecasts of the conditional variance undo this tail thickening? This note considers the effect of changing {{the quality of the}} information embodied in a forecast of a conditional variance. Adding noise of a certain form thickens <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of <b>the</b> normalized errors, but decreasing the amount of information used in the forecast may or may not thicken <b>the</b> <b>tails.</b> We also explore <b>the</b> relation between <b>tail</b> thickness and various notions of “optimal” volatility forecasts.

40|$|Abstract. Float trajectories in {{the ocean}} are shown to have moments of {{displacements}} with large-t behavior 〈|x|p 〉 ∼ tγp for times below an year. The study of γp {{as a function of}} p provides a more complete characterization of ocean dispersion than does the single number γ 2. Also at long times, the core of the displacement distribution relaxes to a self-similar profile, while <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> consisting of floats which have experienced exceptional displacements, are not self-similar. Depending on the region considered, the effect of <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> can be negligible, and then γp is a linear function of p (strong self-similarity). But if <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> are important then γp is a non-trivial function of p (weak self-similarity). In the weakly self-similar case, the low moments are determined by the self-similar core, while the high moments are determined by <b>the</b> non-self-similar <b>tails.</b> <b>The</b> popular exponent γ 2 may be determined by either the core or <b>the</b> <b>tails.</b> Implications of these results for parameterization of ocean dispersion in numerical models are discussed...|$|R
