25|$|The {{concepts}} of digital switching {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype digital switch was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first digital switch to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local switching system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E

50|$|Tandem {{derives from}} the Latin adverb tandem meaning at length, and is used in English to mean a group of two people or {{machines}} working together, usually in series. A <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> is used to interconnect other switches via trunks.

50|$|EWSD (Elektronisches Wählsystem Digital in German, Electronic Digital Switching System/Electronic World Switch Digital in English) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{installed}} telephone exchange systems in the world. EWSD can work as a local or <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> or combined local/tandem, and for landline or mobile phones. It was originally developed by Siemens AG, who claims that EWSD switches perform switching for over 160 million subscriber lines in more than 100 countries.|$|E
50|$|To place {{calls to}} certain other Northern California exchanges, such as Sacramento, Stockton, and Vallejo in Northern California, dial {{customers}} would dial ‘’0’’ {{to reach an}} operator. The operator dialed through a <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> and directly called numbers in those cities. These calls were indicated by {{a star in the}} telephone directory. For other call destinations, customers dialed ‘’211’’ to reach a long distance operator who would connect the customer using manual trunks to reach a distant operator.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, class-4 <b>tandem</b> <b>switches</b> were {{converted}} to deal only with high-speed digital four-wire circuit connections: T1, T3, OC-3, etc. The two-wire local line connections to individual telephones were relegated to the class-5 switches. By {{the dawn of the}} 21st century, almost all other switches also supported four-wire connections.|$|R
50|$|With Bell System divestiture, {{the network}} in the US was divided into local access and {{transport}} areas (LATAs). Calls within LATAs were carried by Local Exchange Carriers (LECs), while calls between them were carried by interexchange carriers (IXCs). LATAs generally have one or more <b>tandem</b> <b>switches</b> which interconnect end office switches.|$|R
5000|$|Under these conditions, early network {{development}} {{revolved around}} two major distinctions, [...] "Paris" [...] and [...] "not Paris." [...] Within metropolitan Paris, automated step switches appeared, {{with a level}} of <b>tandem</b> <b>switching,</b> before World War II. In the rest of the country, automation was confined to major cities, {{with a high level of}} manual intervention.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} less {{efficient}} for tandem calls, since the fabric {{is unable to}} connect a trunk directly to a trunk. Instead, each incoming trunk that {{has the ability to}} make tandem calls has to have a line link frame appearance, {{as if it were a}} line. To avoid expense, incoming trunks were divided into groups, some of them having tandem ability and some not. This complication was avoided in places big enough to pay for a separate <b>tandem</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of class-4 switches in the Bell System during the 1950s and 1960s used crossbar switches, {{such as the}} Crossbar Tandem (XBT) variant of the Number One Crossbar Switching System, or 1XB switch. The Number 4 Crossbar ("4XB") <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> {{was used in the}} North American toll network from 1943 until the 1990s, when it was replaced by more modern digital switching equipment, such as the Lucent 4ESS switch or the Nortel DMS-200. The last 4XB switch in the United States was installed in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|In Telecommunications a Point of Interface (POI) {{is used to}} {{show the}} {{physical}} interface between two different carriers, such as a local exchange carrier (LEC) and a wireless carrier or an LEC and an IntereXchange Carrier (IXC). This demarcation point often defines responsibility as well as serving as a point for testing. In many cases, a POI exists {{as a point of}} demarcation ("DEMARC") within an LEC building, and is established under [...] "Co-Location" [...] agreements. A long distance, wireless, or competitive local carrier 'rents' space at the local telephone (usually <b>tandem</b> <b>switch)</b> location.|$|E
50|$|AT&T {{replaced}} or supplemented the 4ESS toll <b>tandem</b> <b>switches</b> with 5ESS switches, {{which featured}} an advanced design, {{and are used}} as edge switches in the network. Most RBOCs who used 4ESS tandems have replaced them with Class 5 systems of other manufacturers, e.g., Nortel. As of 2014, AT&T operates and maintains approximately one hundred 4ESS switches in the public switched telephone network.|$|R
40|$|In Voice Trunking over ATM (VTOA) technology, the tandem is {{replaced}} by three components: Trunk Inter-Working Function (TIWF), Control and Signaling Inter-Working Function (CS-IWF), and ATM Network. This new architecture calls for re-examination of the signaling channel delay issues, which are well-studied and well-specified for TDM networks. In VTOA, the ATM network together with the inter-working functions act as a virtual <b>tandem</b> <b>switching</b> system, which is called "ATMbased distributed virtual <b>tandem</b> <b>switching</b> system. " The aim is that the performance of ATM-based trunking network {{should be at least}} as good as TDM-based network. The cross-office delay budget must be shared among the interworking functions and the ATM network. Hence, the time for the ATM network to establish a switched virtual connection (SVC) is stringent. In this paper, we propose a simple adaptive SVC caching scheme to offload the high processing capacity burden on ATM switches. After a SVC is established in a usual [...] ...|$|R
50|$|As step offices became rarer, Subscriber Trunk Dialing Codes {{no longer}} {{followed}} the original rules, and were significantly revised in the mid-1990s, with further changes as wider use of mobile phones and non-BT competition {{came into the}} UK market. There are now some 70000 local exchange codes in use in the UK. The largest trunk carrier, British Telecom, connects the local network through some 60 transit (<b>tandem)</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|AT&T has an {{intercept}} {{message that}} is heard due to network congestion: [...] "All circuits are busy now, please try your call again 914-2T". The number and digits {{at the end}} identify the network edge or <b>Tandem</b> <b>switch</b> the caller's local exchange company routed the call to. There is also a network message heard when an attempt {{to route a call}} to a nodal or ISDN T1 on the terminating end fails due to no call set-up signal from the PBX being received by the far-end Tandem or edge switch [...] "Your call did not go through, 9142T".|$|E

5000|$|Once {{operator}} distance dialing was implemented, {{the operator}} would have received a numerical routing from the rate and route operator, such as [...] "Mark: Other Place. Route: A ring-down. Numbers: 801 plus 073 plus 181. Operators 801 plus 073 plus." [...] This routing would allow the Los Angeles operator to dial via the <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> (i.e., class-4 telephone switch) to the Mount Pleasant operator’s switchboard, and have the call come in on a special special trunk (designated by the 181 code) used for incoming calls to ring-down points (places with manual service whose connection to the national network was via a larger point).|$|E
5000|$|Modern <b>tandem</b> <b>switches,</b> {{like other}} classes of {{telephone}} switch, are digital, and use time-division multiplexing (TDM) to carry circuit-switched telephone calls. Tandems were more quickly converted to TDM than the class-5 end-offices were. During {{the transition to}} digital switching in the 1980s and 1990s, when both TDM and traditional [...] "space division" [...] switches were in use, American phone company employees often referred tandems as [...] "TDM switches" [...] as a result.|$|R
50|$|The UNE-P model {{consisted}} of local loop and switching and transportation, and allowed CLECs {{to enter the}} market without investing in supporting equipment and facilities. The further Unbundled Network Element -inclusive enhanced extended loop (EEL) model allowed CLECs to serve customers more easily by using their own local and <b>tandem</b> <b>switching</b> equipment. While CLECs and new market entrants said UNE-P helped open the local telecommunications market, ILECs claimed Unbundled Network Element practices served as a heavily discounted resale of their own network elements.|$|R
50|$|In {{the network}} {{there are various}} classes of {{switching}} systems. An end office switch connects directly to the stations. It knows which circuit to activate (ring) when given a destination number. Other switches in the network are for transport only. These are sometimes called <b>tandem</b> <b>switches.</b> In this case, the goal of destination routing would be to select an outbound span for a particular destination number. The objective {{is to get a}} continuous signal path from the starting location of the caller to the ending location of the called party.|$|R

50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the junctor circuits with incoming trunks, leaving only the ability to connect those incoming trunks to outgoing trunks. In many cases the resulting Crossbar <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its Revertive Pulse senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few both-way, and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, the Ericsson Swedish company {{developed}} their own versions of the 1XB and A204 systems for the international market. In the early 1960s, the company's sales of crossbar switches exceeded those of their rotating 500-switching system, as measured {{in the number of}} lines. Crossbar switching quickly spread {{to the rest of the}} world, replacing most earlier designs like the Strowger (step-by-step) and Panel systems in larger installations in the U.S. Graduating from entirely electromechanical control on introduction, they were gradually elaborated to have full electronic control and a variety of calling features including short-code and speed-dialing. In the UK the Plessey Company produced a range of TXK crossbar exchanges, but their widespread rollout by the British Post Office began later than in other countries, and then was inhibited by the parallel development of TXE reed relay and electronic exchange systems, so they never achieved a large number of customer connections although they did find some success as <b>tandem</b> <b>switch</b> exchanges.|$|E
5000|$|... 4ESS {{development}} {{began in}} about 1970, mainly in Naperville, Illinois {{under the direction}} of Henry Earle Vaughan. AT&T Long Distance was the primary customer for the switch. Driving development from the customer's perspective was AT&T VP Billy Oliver. [...] Previous <b>tandem</b> <b>switching</b> systems, primarily the No. 4 Crossbar switch, used analog voice signaling. The decision to switch in a digital voice format was controversial at the time, both from a technical and economic viewpoint. Nevertheless, visionaries such as Vaughn and Oliver recognized that the network would eventually become digital, requiring digital switching technologies.|$|R
