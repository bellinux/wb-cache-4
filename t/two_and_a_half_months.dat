5|$|Just <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>months</b> later, though, the MTA {{stated that}} it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E

5|$|The 1890 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season is {{tied for the}} third least active {{hurricane season}} on record, behind 1914 and 1930. The first system was initially observed on May27 and the last storm, Hurricane Four, dissipated over Central America on November1. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The first storm moved slowly north-northwestward, bringing heavy rains and extensive flooding to Cuba, which caused at least three fatalities and at least $1million (1890USD) in damage. It dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico on May29. Tropical cyclogenesis went dormant for nearly <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>months,</b> until another system was observed near the Windward Islands on August18. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, grazing the Yucatan Peninsula and making landfall in Louisiana before dissipating on August28. Impact from the storm was minimal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{train was}} {{delivered}} on 22 October and {{was put into}} use on the Sørland Line from 1 November. Scheduled travel time was reduced by 40 minutes to 3 hours and 40 minutes. In December, the trains had problems with the pantographs not working correctly in cold weather, causing the trains to lose power and be several hours delayed. NSB stated that a contributing cause was the previous year's mild winter, which {{made it impossible to}} test the trains in extreme weather. After <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>months</b> of operation on the Sørland Line, every other train was at least 5 minutes late and every tenth train at least 20 minutes late. The trains also caused travel sickness, also among employees, particularly on the section from Kristiansand to Bø.

5|$|Arriving at Batavia in the {{aftermath}} of the engagement, Linois was the subject of criticism from the Dutch governors for his failure to defeat the China convoy. They also refused his requests to make use of the Dutch squadron stationed in port for future operations. Rejoined by Atalante, Linois sold two captured country ships and resupplied his squadron, before sailing for Isle de France, Marengo arriving on 2 April. During the return journey, Linois had detached his frigates and they captured a number of valuable merchant ships sailing independently before joining the admiral at Port Louis, which Decaen had renamed Port Napoleon. On his arrival, Linois was questioned by Decaen about the engagement with the China Fleet and when Decaen found his answers unsatisfactory the governor wrote a scathing letter to Napoleon, which he despatched to France on Berceau. Linois remained at Isle de France for the next <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>months,</b> eventually departing with Marengo, Atalante and Sémillante in late June, while Belle Poule was detached to cruise independently.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{lived as}} a {{bachelor}} {{for most of}} his life. In 1868 he met Belgian soprano Désirée Artôt. They became infatuated with each other and were engaged to be married but due to Artôt's refusal to give up the stage or settle in Russia, the relationship ended. Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved. In 1877, at the age of 37, he wed a former student, Antonina Miliukova. The marriage was a disaster. Mismatched psychologically and sexually, the couple lived together for only <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>months</b> before Tchaikovsky left, overwrought emotionally and suffering from an acute writer's block. Tchaikovsky's family remained supportive of him during this crisis and throughout his life. He was also aided by Nadezhda von Meck, the widow of a railway magnate who had begun contact with him not long before the marriage. As well as an important friend and emotional support, she became his patroness for the next 13 years, which allowed him to focus exclusively on composition. Tchaikovsky's marital debacle may have forced him to face the full truth about his sexuality; he never blamed Antonina for the failure of their marriage.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006, {{with the club}} sitting 22nd in the table, two points adrift of safety. Westley's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1–0 victory away at Cambridge United, as he set about ensuring safety. Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the likes of Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non-League Paper {{when he was out}} of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>months,</b> and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. In all, he managed Rushden for 13 games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three. The reason behind Westley's sacking is unknown, but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill.|$|E

She had not entered any previous Olympic Games. Like Moussambani, Bolopa qualified for the Games as a wildcard because she did not meet the minimum qualification standards for the women's 50 metre freestyle. She began swimming <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>months</b> before the Games. Bolopa took part in the contest's first heat on 22 September, finishing second out of three entered participants, with a time of one minute and 3.97 seconds. The time set a new record as the slowest for a female athlete in the Olympic history of the women's 50 metre freestyle and was double the slowest time of the fastest overall swimmer in the displicine. She received loud support and encouragement from spectators. Bolopa finished second behind the heat's winner Moe Thu Aung of Myanmar (26.80 seconds) after the third participant Fatema Hameed Gerashi of Bahrain was disqualified for a false start. She finished 73rd and last out of all swimmers, and did not progress into the semi-finals because she was 35.90 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced beyond the first round. After the event, Bolopa said that she was very tired because it was the first time she had swum in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.|$|E
