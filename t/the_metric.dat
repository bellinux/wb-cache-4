5|$|In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system, but used pre-revolutionary names—for example 1centimetre {{became the}} duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100g and so on. Certain German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) adopted the zollpfund (customs pound) of 500g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 {{the newly formed}} German Empire adopted <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system as its {{official}} system of weights and measures and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, adopted <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system in 1861.|$|E

5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system was India. In 1863, the first reading of {{a bill that would}} have made <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system or that were considering changing to <b>the</b> <b>metric</b> system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E
