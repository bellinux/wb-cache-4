The jusnomia of social justice implies not only that <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> system is (or it should be) just/fair, but also that the fulfillment of justice is a condition of socioarchy (which is opposed to anarchy). The jusnomic character of justice resides {{in the fact that}} the individuals’ social behavior is rationally and not socially grounded; this means that <b>the</b> individuals’ <b>legal</b> <b>existence</b> is pre-established through norms, independently of their will.
