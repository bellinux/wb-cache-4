Design Open and randomized trial. Setting Kwong Wah Hospital, a large public hospital in an urban location (Hong Kong). Patient(s) Forty patients after their first conservative operation for endometriosis, with surgical confirmation of revised AFS stage III or IV endometriosis. Intervention(s) Postoperative 6 months' therapy of danazol or <b>triptorelin</b> every 6 weeks, postmedical therapy second-look laparoscopy. Main outcome measure(s) Symptom control and patients' tolerance during medical therapy, posttherapy revised AFS score, hormonal profile during <b>triptorelin</b> therapy. Result(s) Pain control was similar between danazol and <b>triptorelin</b> therapy. There was less breakthrough bleeding with <b>triptorelin.</b> More patients failed to complete the whole course of danazol because of its side effects. The revised AFS score at second-look laparoscopy did not show {{a significant difference between the}} two medications. Adequate pituitary suppression was observed with injection of <b>triptorelin</b> every 6 weeks. Conclusion(s) : Lengthening of <b>triptorelin</b> administration intervals from 4 weeks to 6 weeks is effective in maintaining a hypoestrogenic state.

40|$|<b>Triptorelin</b> is a {{synthetic}} analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; {{also known as}} luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH]), which has enhanced receptor affinity, extended half-life and increased bioactivity. <b>Triptorelin</b> initially stimulates the pituitary gland, increasing serum luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels; however, after 3 - 4 weeks, the pituitary becomes refractory due to receptor desensitization and/or down-regulation, resulting in castration levels of testosterone in men and postmenopausal estradiol levels in women. Pharmacologic equivalence {{studies have shown that}} <b>triptorelin,</b> buserelin and goserelin are equally effective in down-regulating the pituitary-gonadal axis, and the new 3 - and 1 -month depot formulations of <b>triptorelin</b> have equal efficacy. In men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, administration of <b>triptorelin</b> leads to subjective improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms and pain, as well as objective responses such as decreased serum levels of acid and alkaline phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen, decreased prostate volume, and regression of skeletal metastases. Randomized clinical trials comparing <b>triptorelin</b> with bilateral orchidectomy have shown no significant differences in clinical response, survival or side effects. The time to subjective response was shorter in patients treated with orchidectomy, but there was a trend towards reduced psychologic morbidity in those treated with <b>triptorelin.</b> In randomized clinical trials comparing <b>triptorelin</b> with leuprolide (leuprorelin), two studies concluded that <b>triptorelin</b> induced a more rapid decrease in testosterone levels, although both drugs had similar clinical efficacy, whereas a third study concluded that <b>triptorelin</b> reduced testosterone levels less rapidly than, but maintained castration levels of testosterone as effectively as, leuprolide. The 9 -month survival rate was significantly higher for <b>triptorelin</b> (97 % vs 90. 5 % for leuprorelin). Neoadjuvant <b>triptorelin</b> treatment in localized prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy may reduce the incidence of positive surgical margins, but no survival advantage has been demonstrated. Neoadjuvant treatment before radiotherapy, by reducing prostatic volume, may decrease radiation-related complications, and may increase survival in a subset of patients with a Gleason score of 2 - 6. The most common adverse effects of <b>triptorelin</b> and GnRH agonists in general, are hot flushes, loss of libido, and impotence. The initial increase in serum testosterone levels - the 'flare' phenomenon - may lead to exacerbation of bone pain, paraplegia and (rarely) death in patients with a large tumor burden. Androgen deprivation leads to a reduction in bone mineral density of 3 - 5 % per year, but it remains to be proven that this significantly increases the clinical fracture risk in patients with prostate cancer. In conclusion, the clinical efficacy and tolerability of <b>triptorelin</b> in the treatment of prostate cancer are similar to that of surgical castration and leuprolide. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

This preplanned 12 -month analysis evaluated E 2, E 1, E 1 S, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels in all patients and the proportion of patients with E 2 levels greater than 2. 72 pg/mL at any time point during treatment with exemestane plus <b>triptorelin.</b> Results: One hundred sixteen patients (exemestane, n = 86; tamoxifen, n = 30; median age, 44 years; median E 2, 51 pg/mL; 55 % prior chemotherapy) started <b>triptorelin</b> and had one or more samples drawn. With exemestane plus <b>triptorelin,</b> median reductions from baseline E 2, E 1, and E 1 S levels were consistently ≥ 95 %, resulting in significantly lower levels than with tamoxifen plus <b>triptorelin</b> at all time points. Among patients on exemestane plus <b>triptorelin,</b> 25 %, 24 %, and 17 % had an E 2 level greater than 2. 72 pg/mL at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of monthly administrations of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists <b>triptorelin</b> pamoate and leuprolide acetate to induce and maintain castrate levels of serum testosterone in men with advanced prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with advanced prostate cancer {{were randomly assigned to}} receive <b>triptorelin</b> 3. 75 mg or leuprolide 7. 5 mg. The agent was injected intramuscularly every 28 days for nine injections. Primary endpoints were the percentages of men whose serum testosterone concentrations declined to and were maintained at or below castrate levels (≤ 1. 735 nmol/L or ≤ 500 ng/L) during 9 months (253 days) of treatment. Secondary endpoints were luteinizing hormone levels, bone pain, prostate specific antigen levels, quality of life, testosterone pharmacodynamics, survival, and safety variables. RESULTS: In all, 284 men received either <b>triptorelin</b> (140) or leuprolide (144). The percentage of men with castrate levels of serum testosterone was lower at 29 days for <b>triptorelin</b> than for leuprolide (91. 2 % vs 99. 3 %; point estimate - 8. 0, 95 % confidence interval - 16. 9 % to - 1. 4 %), but equivalent at 57 days (97. 7 % vs 97. 1 %). The mean (98. 8 % vs 97. 3 %) and cumulative (96. 2 % vs 91. 2 %) castration maintenance rates between 29 and 253 days were equivalent between the treatment groups.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{through which}} luteinizing hormone (LH) -releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists suppress pituitary gonadotroph functions and LHRH-receptor (LHRH-R) expression are incompletely understood. Consequently, we investigated the direct effect of LHRH antagonist cetrorelix in vitro on {{the expression of}} the pituitary LHRH-R gene and its ability to counteract the exogenous LHRH and the agonist <b>triptorelin</b> in the regulation of this gene. We also compared the effects of chronic administration of cetrorelix and <b>triptorelin</b> on the LHRH-R mRNA level and gonadotropin secretion in ovariectomized (OVX) and normal female rats. The exposure of pituitary cells in vitro to 3 -min pulses of 1 nM LHRH or 0. 1 nM <b>triptorelin</b> for 5 h increased the LHRH-R mRNA level by 77 – 88 %. Continuous perfusion of the cells with 50 nM cetrorelix did not cause any significant changes, but prevented the stimulatory effect of LHRH pulses on the receptor mRNA expression. In OVX rats, 10 days after administration of a depot formulation of cetrorelix, releasing 100 μg of peptide daily, the elevated LHRH-R mRNA level was decreased by 73 %, whereas daily injection of 100 μg of <b>triptorelin</b> caused a 41 % suppression. In normal female rats, cetrorelix treatment suppressed the LHRH-R mRNA level by 33 %, but <b>triptorelin</b> increased it by 150 %. The highly elevated serum LH levels in OVX rats and the normal LH concentration of cycling rats were rapidly and completely suppressed by cetrorelix. <b>Triptorelin</b> decreased the serum LH in OVX rats to the precastration level, but had no effect on basal LH in normal rats. Our results confirm that LHRH antagonists, such as cetrorelix, inhibit the gene expression of pituitary LHRH-R indirectly, by counteracting the stimulatory effect of LHRH. A rapid suppression of serum LH by LHRH antagonists would be advantageous in the treatment of sex hormone-dependent tumors and other conditions...|$|E

Therefore, multiple, national observational, noninterventional studies were initiated to assess the effectiveness of <b>triptorelin</b> in reducing moderate or severe LUTS [International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) > 7] in men with prostate cancer starting <b>triptorelin</b> therapy in clinical practice. Methods: Prospective, noninterventional, multicentre studies of LUTS located in Algeria, Belgium, China, Hungary, Romania and South Korea, in patients who were scheduled to receive <b>triptorelin</b> (3 -month extended release or 1 -month formulation) in clinical practice. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the proportion of patients with moderate or severe LUTS after 48 weeks as assessed by IPSS. Secondary endpoints included the distribution of IPSS categories, total IPSS and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks. Results: In total, 2461 patients were recruited in the studies; 1282 patients had moderate or severe LUTS at baseline (IPSS[*]>[*] 7), received <b>triptorelin</b> and had follow-up IPSS. Mean total IPSS was reduced from 18. 2 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 17. 8 – 18. 5] at baseline to 11. 9 (95 % CI 11. 5 – 12. 3; p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 10. 6 (95 % CI 10. 2 – 11. 0; p[*]<[*] 0. 001) at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. Mean PSA levels were reduced from 117. 9 [*]ng/ml (95 % CI 93. 8 – 141. 9) at baseline to 8. 5 [*]ng/ml (95 % CI 5. 2 – 11. 7) and 16. 6 [*]ng/ml (95 % CI 7. 4 – 25. 8) at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. There was a significant correlation between total IPSS change from baseline and PSA change from baseline at weeks 24 and 48 (ρ = 0. 3 and 0. 2, p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: GnRH antagonists have {{recently}} been introduced {{for the prevention of}} premature LH surges during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). We have here investigated whether the GnRH antagonists cetrorelix and ganirelix exert effects on ovarian steroidogenesis. Since there is some controversy about the action of GnRH agonists in the human ovary we also tested the effect of <b>triptorelin</b> on steroid production in cultured human granulosa lutein cells. Methods: Cells were obtained from patients treated with different protocols of COH. In addition to gonadotropins they received <b>triptorelin,</b> cetrorelix, ganirelix or no GnRH analogue. Results: Such in vivo treatment did not result in significant effects of <b>triptorelin</b> or the two GnRH antagonists on spontaneous or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) -stimulated steroidogenesis. To exclude the possibility that the in vivo treatment might not affect in vitro steroid production because of low or absent peptide activity, we performed in vitro treatments with <b>triptorelin,</b> cetrorelix and ganirelix for up to 96 h. However, these treatment paradigms did not influence basal or hCG-stimulated steroid production. Conclusions: We conclude that GnRH antagonists do not exert any significant effects on ovarian steroidogenesis in vitro and therefore their introduction into protocols of COH is unlikely to impair ovarian function.

40|$|Between March and September 1988, 74 {{patients}} with progressive ovarian cancer after prior platinum-based therapy {{were treated with}} the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist <b>Triptorelin</b> (Decapeptyl degrees). Treatment consisted of i. m. injection of 3. 75 mg of microencapsulated <b>Triptorelin</b> on days 1, 8 and 28 followed by 4 -weekly injections until tumor progression. No objective responses were observed. Eleven out of 68 evaluable patients (16 %) had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 5 months in {{patients with}} disease stabilization and 2 months for all evaluable patients. The median survival for patients with disease stabilization was 17 months, whereas for all patients it was 4 months. The treatment was well tolerated; the only reported adverse events were incidental hot flushes. This study showed that the LHRH agonist <b>Triptorelin</b> has only modest efficacy in patients pretreated with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

40|$|Gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) {{plays a key}} role in reproduction. This decapeptide is synthesized and released by hypothalamus and induces the pituitary gonadotrop cells to release pituitary gonadotropin hormones. In some extrapituitary compartments GnRH and its receptor act as part of the autocrine regulatory system of cell proliferation. The anticancer activity of GnRH and its analogues has been observed by many researchers. In this study the anticancer activity of a new analogue of GnRH and <b>triptorelin</b> was investigated by cell proliferation assay. Results indicate that proliferation of human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines are dose-dependently inhibited. The inhibitory efficiency of the new analogue is proved to be higher than the original <b>triptorelin.</b> In addition to its antimitogenic activity, evidence was found for the involvement of the apoptotic mechanism in the action of the new analogue and <b>triptorelin.</b> In conclusion, the new analogue can be considered as a good pharmaceutical candidate...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} aims at demonstrating the {{equivalence}} of the 28 -day and 3 -month formulations of <b>triptorelin</b> SR (sustained release) {{in terms of}} percentage of patients achieving castration levels of estradiol (<== 50 pg/mL) 84 days after treatment initiation. DESIGN: A phase II, prospective, randomized, multicenter, open {{study was conducted in}} two parallel groups of women with endometriosis. SETTING: Academic hospitals. PATIENT(S) : Seventy-two women with endometriosis. were treated with a single intramuscular injection of 3 -month <b>triptorelin</b> SR, and 74 patients were treated with one intramuscular injection of 28 -day <b>triptorelin</b> SR every 28 days for 3 months. INTERVENTION(S) : As part of two parallel treatment groups, 72 women were given a single intramuscular injection of 3 -month <b>triptorelin</b> SR, and 74 women were given one intramuscular injection of 28 -day <b>triptorelin</b> SR every 28 days for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Percentage of patients achieving castration levels of estradiol {{at the end of the}} treatment period. RESULT(S) : Patients participated in the study until resumption of menses. Ninety-seven percent of patients given the 3 -month formulation and 94 % of those given the 28 -day formulation were in a state of medical castration on day 84. The mean time to achieve castration was shorter for the 3 -month formulation, and the duration of castration was significantly longer. The FSH and LH parameters were comparable, though not always identical. CONCLUSION(S) : The pharmacodynamic effects of the Decapeptyl SR 3 -month formulation are equivalent to those of the 28 -day formulation. The 3 -month formulation provides the added advantage of a longer maintenance of medical castration in women who have endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{agonists}} are {{the agents}} of choice for achieving androgen suppression in men with advanced prostate cancer. The GnRH agonists {{that have been developed}} and marketed for prostate cancer are leuprolide, goserelin, <b>triptorelin,</b> and histrelin. So far, there have been few randomized studies directly comparing these single-agent therapies; however, the literature and the data on file with the Food and Drug Administration suggest that <b>triptorelin</b> may be more reliable than leuprolide in maintaining castration levels of serum testosterone.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{agonists}} (e. g., <b>triptorelin)</b> {{are used}} for androgen suppression therapy. They possess improved stability {{as compared to the}} natural GnRH, yet they suffer from a poor pharmacokinetic profile. To address this, we used a GnRH peptide-modified dendrimer platform with and without lipidation strategy. Dendrimers were synthesized on a polylysine core and bore either native GnRH (1, 2, and 5) or lipid-modified GnRH (3 and 4). Compound 3, which bore a lipidic moiety in a branched tetramer structure, showed approximately 10 -fold higher permeability and metabolic stability and 39 times higher antitumor activity against hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells (DU 145) relative to <b>triptorelin.</b> In gonadotropin-release experiments, dendrimer 3 was shown to be the most potent construct. Dendrimer 3 showed similar luteinizing hormone (LH) -release activity to <b>triptorelin</b> in mice. Our findings indicate that dendrimer 3 is a promising analog with higher potency for the treatment of hormone-resistant prostate cancer than the currently available GnRH agonists...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) can inhibit {{proliferation}} of multiple reproductive tissue cancer cell lines through direct interaction with GnRH receptors (GnRHR) on tumour cells. GnRH analogues may therefore {{have a role}} in treating some cancers. The signalling pathways associated with these inhibitory effects are poorly defined, and characterising them may help to understand therapeutic sensitivity. To elucidate these pathways, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches were used to compare the effects of the GnRH agonist <b>Triptorelin</b> in responsive GnRHR-transfected HEK 293 cells (SCL 60) and unresponsive (HEK 293) cells both in vitro for up to 24 h and in vivo for up to 7 days. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that SCL 60 gene expression was temporally regulated with <b>Triptorelin</b> treatment, with expression of some genes increased at one time point but decreased at another. Early and mid-phase gene expression changes comprised mainly transcription factors and late changes included the hormonal signalling component CGA. Pathway analysis implicated mitogen-activated protein kinase and cell cycle pathways, supporting the detection of G 2 /M arrest. Signalling effects within SCL 60 xenografts, 4 and 7 days following <b>Triptorelin</b> treatment, were investigated using a phosphoproteomic antibody array. Changes included cell cycle and apoptosis regulators, as well as cell surface receptors and NFκB signalling pathway members. Reverse-phase protein arrays and western blotting also showed that pAkt was decreased and pNFκB-p 65 was increased after <b>Triptorelin</b> treatment in vitro. An NFκB inhibitor enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of <b>Triptorelin</b> in SCL 60 cells in vitro, suggesting that NFκB acts as a survival factor in the response to GnRHR stimulation. A range of GnRHR expression was observed in breast cancer tumours by immunohistochemistry, and on average GnRHR expression was significantly higher in the Triple Negative Phenotype (TNP) subgroup and in grade 3 tumours. A GnRHR-transfected breast cancer cell line, MCF 7 -h 14, was developed. Despite this expressing a similar level of GnRHR to responsive SCL 60 cells, MCF 7 -h 14 cells were not inhibited by GnRHR activation, indicating that a high level of GnRHR is insufficient for the antiproliferative effects of <b>Triptorelin.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
