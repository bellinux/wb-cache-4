5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s the stand {{accommodated}} the away fans. Previously {{it was open}} to home supporters. The lower tier of the old stand was <b>terracing</b> and this was closed off {{by the turn of}} the 1980s due to it being a fire hazard as the <b>terracing</b> steps were wooden. The front concrete <b>terracing</b> remained and was one of the last standing areas at a Premiership ground.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park, as it {{was known}} between 1899 and 1997, is almost {{completely}} different from the Ibrox Stadium of today. It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side. The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed {{with each other to}} host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches, one of which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large <b>terracing,</b> holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth. The <b>terracing,</b> designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden <b>terracing</b> was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 2009, {{weeks after}} the stadium opened, part of the ground's away section was {{earmarked}} for conversion into <b>terracing.</b> This was because of high demand from away supporters, who had previously {{had to pay for}} a seating ticket, even though they preferred to stand. Even before this remodelling was complete, Malmö FF lowered the away ticket prices to match the price of a home <b>terracing</b> ticket. This restructuring was completed before the 2010 season. The <b>terracing</b> for the home supporters was also modified to ease mobility, and combat safety issues in the stands. The old pitch was removed and a new one was installed in preparation for the 2015 Allsvenskan season. The new surface was produced from the same Dutch grass producer who will provide the pitch for the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final at Olympiastadion Berlin. UEFA had previously criticized the surface at the stadium following the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage.|$|E

5|$|The Muntz Street ground, then {{situated}} on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered {{on two sides}} by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with <b>terracing</b> round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the <b>terracing</b> raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it proved {{too small for the}} football club's needs. They built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily built-up area, was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street of the same name remains.|$|E

5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are standing spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when {{the stage is}} on either long side of the stadium, or up to 40,000 when it is {{placed in front of}} either short side. It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor <b>terracing</b> sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand <b>terracing</b> was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E

5000|$|Although Melbourne {{retains a}} large number of {{heritage}} registered <b>terraces,</b> many rows were substantially affected by widescale slum reclamation programs in favour of the Housing Commission of Victoria's high-rise public housing plans during the 1950s and 60s. Later private development of walk-up flats and in-fill development has further reduced the number of complete rows. However the 1960s saw a new trend of restoration as part of the gentrification of Melbourne's inner suburbs. [...] As a result, streets and suburbs which contain large intact rows of terraced housing are now fairly rare. Suburbs such as Albert Park, Fitzroy, Carlton, Parkville and East Melbourne are now subject to strict heritage overlays to preserve what is left of these streetscapes.Some of the more notable examples of terraced housing in Melbourne include the heritage registered Tasma <b>Terrace,</b> Canterbury, Clarendon <b>Terrace,</b> Burlington <b>Terrace,</b> Cypress <b>Terrace,</b> Dorset <b>Terrace,</b> Nepean <b>Terrace</b> and Annerly <b>Terrace</b> (East Melbourne), Blanche <b>Terrace,</b> Cobden <b>Terrace,</b> Holyrood <b>Terrace</b> (Fitzroy), Rochester <b>Terrace</b> and the St Vincent Gardens precinct (Albert Park), Royal <b>Terrace,</b> Holcombe <b>Terrace,</b> Denver <b>Terrace,</b> Dalmeny House & Cramond House, and Benvenuta (Carlton), Marion <b>Terrace</b> (St Kilda) and Finn Barr (South Melbourne).|$|R

5|$|When {{it first}} opened, the ground had few {{facilities}} for either player or spectator. Uncovered <b>terracing</b> surrounded the pitch, and a hut acted as the players' changing room. A small but well-appointed covered wooden stand {{was built on}} the Coventry Road side, and over the years the <b>terracing</b> was enlarged to raise the capacity to around 30,000. In 1895, the football club bought the lease to the ground, which had 11 years remaining, for a sum of £275. Two years later, they paid £90 to their near neighbours, Aston Villa Football Club, for an old grandstand from Villa's former Wellington Road ground in Perry Barr. The club transported it piece by piece, and re-erected it as a terrace cover behind the goal at the Muntz Street end. No other major improvements were made, nor did the club ever move their administrative offices to the site, instead maintaining premises in Corporation Street, in Birmingham city centre.|$|E
5|$|With the club's {{finances}} in {{a strong}} position, York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the <b>terracing</b> in the Popular Stand and the Shipton Street End. The Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street over the summer of 1955, {{and a year later}} a concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and <b>terracing.</b> The ground was fitted with floodlights in 1959, which were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United. The floodlights were updated and improved in 1980, and were officially switched on for a friendly with Grimsby Town. A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End in 1981, and two years later new offices for the manager, secretary, matchday and lottery manager were built, along with a vice-presidents' lounge.|$|E

5|$|Before the Taylor Report {{demanded that}} the stadium be all-seated, Easter Road had vast banks of <b>terracing</b> on three sides, which meant that it could hold crowds in excess of 60,000.

40|$|<b>Terraces</b> eroded into {{sediment}} (alluvial) and bedrock (strath) preserve {{an important}} history of river activity. River <b>terraces</b> {{are thought to}} form when a river switches from a period of slow vertical incision and valley widening to fast vertical incision and <b>terrace</b> abandonment. Consequently, <b>terraces</b> are often interpreted to reflect changing external drivers including tectonics, sea level, and climate. In contrast, the intrinsic unsteadiness of lateral migration in rivers may generate <b>terraces</b> even under constant rates of vertical incision without external forcing. To explore this mechanism, we simulate landscape evolution by a vertically incising, meandering river and isolate the age and geometry of autogenic river <b>terraces.</b> Modeled autogenic <b>terraces</b> form {{for a wide range}} of lateral and vertical incision rates and are often paired and longitudinally extensive for intermediate ratios of vertical-to-lateral erosion rate. Autogenic <b>terraces</b> have a characteristic reoccurrence time that scales with the time for relief generation. There is a preservation bias against older <b>terraces</b> due to reworking of previously visited parts of the valley. Evolving, spatial differences in bank strength between bedrock and sediment reduce <b>terrace</b> formation frequency and length, favor pairing, and can explain sublinear <b>terrace</b> margins at valley boundaries. Age differences and geometries for modeled autogenic <b>terraces</b> are consistent, in cases, with natural <b>terraces</b> and overlap with metrics commonly attributed to <b>terrace</b> formation due to climate change. We suggest a new phase space of <b>terrace</b> properties that may allow differentiation of autogenic <b>terraces</b> from <b>terraces</b> formed by external drivers...|$|R
