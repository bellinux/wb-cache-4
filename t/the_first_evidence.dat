5|$|Observations of Titan {{prior to}} the space age were limited. In 1907 Spanish {{astronomer}} Josep Comas i Solà observed limb darkening of Titan, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> that the body has an atmosphere. In 1944 Gerard P. Kuiper used a spectroscopic technique to detect an atmosphere of methane.|$|E
5|$|The WHT {{has been}} used to make many {{significant}} new discoveries. Some of the more notable include <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre of the Milky Way (in 1995) and the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 970228) (in 1997).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> for the {{existence}} of Jupiter's magnetic field came in 1955, with the discovery of the decametric radio emission or DAM. As the DAM's spectrum extended up to 40MHz, astronomers concluded that Jupiter must possess a magnetic field with a strength of about 1milliteslas (10gauss).|$|E
50|$|The {{observation}} {{also provides}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> observational <b>evidence</b> for <b>the</b> existence of stellar-mass black hole binaries. Furthermore, it is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> observational <b>evidence</b> of stellar-mass black holes weighing 25 solar masses or more.|$|R

5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing {{of the discovery of}} bones by local workmen he led excavations {{in the area of the}} hyena den. His work led to the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> for the use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.|$|E
60|$|But {{nothing of}} the sort {{occurred}} during this hideous death march, and with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pale heralding of dawn we reached our goal--an open place {{in the midst of a}} tangled wildwood.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> cited <b>evidence</b> goes as {{far back}} as 1226 and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> written <b>evidence</b> is from the 13th century. The village was {{originally}} a town, which was damaged during the Hussite wars. There is a village green, a school, 2 pubs, a camp, and a Church. The Church was dedicated in 1290 and it was built in a Gothic style.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, Cassini found <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of fluid-filled {{channels}} on Titan, in {{a series}} of deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare. This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's Grand Canyon, or a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Rubin {{spent her}} life advocating {{for women in}} science and was known for her mentorship of {{aspiring}} women astronomers. Her data provided some of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> for dark matter, which had been theorized by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. She was honored throughout her career for her achievements, and received the Bruce Medal, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the National Medal of Science, among others.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the {{movement}} in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 {{to the beginning of the}} 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining. The fifteenth century also sees <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of ceremonial regalia.|$|E

5|$|The WHT is {{equipped}} {{with a wide range of}} instruments operating over the optical and near-infrared regimes. These are used by professional astronomers to conduct a wide range of astronomical research. Astronomers using the telescope discovered <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> for a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre of the Milky Way, and made the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst. The telescope has 75% clear nights, with a median seeing of 0.7".|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{education}} in Giffnock is of a small private school that operated in the lodge house at the Redhurst Hotel. Due to the increased population, the first public school opened in 1902 in the Tower Rooms of Giffnock United Free Church, known now as the Orchardhill Parish Church.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of human}} {{presence}} in the area is dated between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago. The area of the park has been sparsely populated throughout historical times, however from the 17th to the 19th century the local communities of Zagori acquired an autonomous status, flourished economically due to increased trade, and became a major center of folk medicine. In recent decades, ecotourism {{is seen as a}} remedy to the economic decline of heavily depopulated local settlements, while preserving the natural environment and local architecture.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{presence}} of a neutralizing substance in the blood that could counter infections came when Emil von Behring along with Kitasato Shibasaburō in 1890 developed effective serum against diphtheria. This they did by transferring serum produced from animals immunized against diphtheria to animals suffering from it. Transferring the serum thus could cure the infected animals. Behring was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 1901.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{something}} was wrong at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio contact with the posts, and drove to the bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|The main British attack {{started in}} the west on 19 September; the {{regiment}} remained in the Jordan Valley keeping patrols close to the Turkish positions to watch for any withdrawal. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of that was observed the next day, when the Turks retired from their forward positions. The regiment then moved to join {{the rest of the}} brigade at Khubret Fusail on the western bank of the Jordan.|$|E

5|$|According to biographer C. Douglas Kroll, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{a form of}} {{football}} at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. However, {{it is widely believed}} by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player at the nearby College of New Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by kicking the ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure. The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships in the same time period.|$|E
5|$|After a lack {{of records}} from the first millennium, Zaprešić again became known in the late 11thcentury. In 1094, {{following}} {{the formation of the}} Zagreb Diocese, Ača, an advisor of the Croato–Hungarian King Ladislav I, was granted land west and east of the Medvednica Mountain to protect the newly formed diocese. Zaprešić became part of the Susedgrad–Stubica manor, the second-biggest estate in the Croato-Hungarian Zagreb County. In 1334, the parish church of St. Peter was founded in Zaprešić, marking <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> of the modern settlement of Zaprešić. The settlement developed rapidly, which is attributed to its position on important trade and transit routes. This was corroborated by the route of the first railway in Croatia, which passes through Zaprešić.|$|E
5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation have resulted in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>evidence</b> for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which {{has not yet been}} developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
