5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used {{as a model for the}} perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E

She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education. Catherine believed education could change {{the hearts and minds of}} the Russian people and turn them away from backwardness. This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility.|$|E

On working with Koechlin and Shah she said, [...] "He (Shah) was punctual and always prepared, he gave his best performance in the first take. Kalki allows herself to be vulnerable.

She described Waiting as a [...] "gentle and poignant film" [...] and said, [...] "It would make the audiences want {{to reach out to the}} leading characters and help them find their answers." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{interviews}} {{preceding the}} release of 2001's Soul Reaver 2, Hennig said that Crystal Dynamics had a huge investment in Kain as a character. His portrayal in this game extrapolated further from Blood Omens story, and was influenced by Joseph Campbell's ideals. No longer acting as a pure villain, Kain was intended {{to function as a}} [...] "steadfast character", coming to the story from a position of knowledge in contrast to Raziel's relative ignorance. Hennig expressed that, by Soul Reaver 2, her personal perception of Kain's character had changed over the years, and that she now considered him a somewhat more attractive and interesting individual than Raziel due to his complexity. She dubbed him a tragic hero, [...] "screwed by his own character flaws", and argued that this hamartia added to his depth. Since joining Naughty Dog, when asked whether Raziel or Kain is closest <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart,</b> Hennig has said that while Raziel is a sympathetic protagonist, she probably prefers Kain as a character.|$|E
