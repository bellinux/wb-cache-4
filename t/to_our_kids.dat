As a game designer, I was left to wonder: What is the military doing <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids?</b> We are blitzed by news that blames entertainment for our tragedies: Beavis & Butthead caused a young boy to set his house on fire; Doom caused teenagers to gun down their classmates in Columbine.

40|$|The sexualisation {{of girls}} {{in popular culture}} has {{captured}} both scholarly and public attention in Australia. Almost as soon as Emma Rush and Andrea La Nauze's reports, Corporate Paedophilia (2006 a) and Stopping the Sexualisation of our Children (2006 b), presented evidence that corporations were sexualising children through their advertising practices, others heralded these claims as obsolete (Egan & Hawkes, 2008). The concerns, however, have not abated; instead activists {{from a range of}} backgrounds have mobilised against corporate advertising, professionals have published advice books for parents on bringing up girls in this current context, and governments have considered a range of public policy responses (Albury and Lumby, 2010 a; Smith and Attwood, 2011). We argue that at this time of heightened awareness and debate it is important to use a feminist lens to examine the way the sexualisation of girls has been framed and discussed. The research reported in this paper specifically examined the way experts and members of the public identified and talked about the sexualisation of girls on a televised debate and an Internet discussion board that followed the broadcast. The 2007 televised debate, Sex Sells – but at what cost <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids?,</b> occurred at a significant time in the public discussion about the sexualisation of girls in popular culture, when the debate was "simmering and gathering heat" (Albury and Lumby, 2010 a, p. 56), and captures a moment when experts and the public were finding their voices in the sexualisation debate, providing insight into the underlying discourses that frame the current debate...|$|E

40|$|In our thesis we {{primarily}} {{focused on}} how to get our preschool children to eat healthy without having to force them into it. Most adults have at least one negative childhood eating experience, nonetheless they still use inappropriate principles or techniques when it comes to encouraging their children towards a healthy and balanced diet. Parents often forget they have to set a proper example for their children, since they are known to take up eating habits from their parents. Nowadays, a child spends more time on average at a kindergarten than at home, that is why the theoretical part of this thesis will start off with the "Kindergarten Kurikulum (1999) ". We also introduced new findings and trends on eating healthy and general guidelines for children's healthy eating habits. We also focused on child development concerns regarding eating habits. The following segment of our theoretical part focused on the healthy food that we provide <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids,</b> the importance of a healthy diet, the amount of food that our kids require and other principles that help us maintain a healthy diet. Our last segment focused on issues and concerns regarding feeding, where we talked about food rejection and force feeding. The empirical part of our thesis focused on researching the state of our Kindergartens and whether or not inappropriate ways of feeding can still be found today. We wanted to know how the kindergarten staff reacts when kids decline food and if the kindergarten staff is aware of their improper feeding methods. Our research included three public Kindergartens in three different cities. Findings show that some concealed ways of improper feeding methods can still be found today...|$|E
40|$|To be {{published}} [5843 words] In my view, {{most of the}} rancorous disagreement about using “games ” in – and for – education stems from a fundamental difference across generations about exactly what the word “game ” signifies. This is not surprising, since when today’s adults were growing up games meant one thing, but since that time an entirely new kind of game – I call it the “complex ” game – has evolved, about which today’s adults know practically nothing. Aside from watching their kids get absorbed in these games, and hearing things (usually bad) in the press, most adults have no first-hand knowledge of these “complex ” games at all. So {{an understanding of what}} most kids are talking about when they say “game ” that is adequate for judging whether or not these experiences are valuable (and I think, along with many others, that they are) is not only totally absent in most adults, but is also almost totally inaccessible even to those adults that are interested. Precisely because of these games’ complexity, such access requires a tremendous effort, which few adults – including, notably, almost all of those who criticize such games – will ever put in. My goal in this article is to fill in – to the extent one can without actually playing the games – this important “blind spot ” in adults ’ knowledge of their kids ’ games. In doing so I hope to help all unaware parents, and teachers and other adults (whom I often call “Digital Immigrants” ∗ since they were born too early for this technology to be “theirs ” in a Native way) understand what these new “complex ” games are, and why they are so important <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids,</b> to education, and, ultimately, to us all...|$|E

Ukie’s letter, your v-mail {{letter of the}} 14 th of Nov., and your air mail letter[s] of the 16 th and 17 th of November arrived {{as well as a}} Christmas package from Harold 2 ̆ 6 Alma and the cigarette lighter from Mort. This regular mail delivery is doing wonders for my morale even though it hasn’t suffered of late. That party for Sanford sounded darn cute. Gee, hon, I’m so terribly sorry that you didn’t feel so well that evening. Darling, I’ve asked you to mentioned [sic] the dates you receive my letters—merely to determine how long my letters take to reach you. You know, I’ve sent you the suede brush in the same package I mailed you the film. Some of the remarks in this letter may be rather disjoined [sic] since I am scanning your letters for queries, etc. Is it considered a privilege to join the Cleve. Assoc. for Nursery Education? Do join, ear, if you think that you’ll get anything which will benefit you professionally. As far as money, dear, don’t worry your pretty little head. I can’t spend money here for “love or money. ” I think we’ll be sitting pretty nicely by the time the war is over and I hope it’s over tomorrow. That little story of the “Jones Boys” is cute. All of the officers are getting a kick out of it. And as far as that article by Richard Harding—we said the same thing ever since we had the opportunity to visit San Antonio. Darling, I’m becoming quite a correspondent, if I have to say so myself. I’m right up to the minute on all my correspondence and have been averaging 6 to 7 letters per night. Sweets, if you were at my side, you’d be doing all the letter writing—you know it, don’t you? What I wouldn’t give to have you at my side—Oh, Boy! Just one hour of love!! Lt. Haygood[‘s], one of the battery officer’s [sic] wife is expecting a baby around Christmas. Gee, but he worries himself sick and is really “sweating it out. ” Watching him makes me glad that we didn’t plunge before I came over. The Rueben’s [sic] Xmas box arrived in excellent shape. It contained anchovies, salted pecan nuts, mints, gums, book, cheese spread, gum, candy 2 ̆ 6 canned frankfurters. Each item was individually wrapped in pieces of “P. M. ” paper. This makes the second time I received anchovies. The first came in Rosen’s [sic] package. I really and truly like them, too. Ukie’s picture is rather charming and does her proud. I’m sending out some G. I. Christmas cards if I can get to it. Say, sweets, how is your dieting coming along? I’m awaiting a report on latest developments. This evening we took pictures of our little cellar “den. ” If the pictures come out O. K. I’ll send you the negatives. There’s an awful lot of “rigarole” [sic] you’ve got to go through to get films printed. First you’ve got to send the roll of exposed film to a censor who develops the film 2 ̆ 6 censors it. Your negatives are returned and I’ve yet to learn where you get them printed. Are you adding any photos to the album? Why not? O. K., so you are. You know, I’d like to spend about 10 minutes with you in a “hollering session” followed by a love session (frustrated personality). I suppose you know I’m saving all your letters and {{hope to be able to}} read them <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> when we gather around the fire for a family bull session.

Are you saving all the clippings about the 9 th Army[?] I want to put them in a scrap book. Goodnight, darling. It’s late and I must have my 10 hrs. sleep.
