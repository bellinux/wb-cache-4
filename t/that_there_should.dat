5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists thought <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{subsequently}} requested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be no reprints or paperback {{version of}} the book, and for the British market no paperback version appeared until after Fleming's death. Because of the heightened sexual writing in the novel, it was banned {{in a number of}} countries. In the US the story was also published in Stag magazine, with the title changed to Motel Nymph.|$|E
5|$|The team's Vice President of Public Relations has {{defended the}} use of Chief Wahoo, saying that fans only {{associate}} Wahoo with baseball. The success of the team in the 2016 season led to renewed attention, with pressure from current MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be progress towards elimination of the logo.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas {{was estimated to be}} 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} throughout the West End and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept pace with the {{increase}} in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be at least 12 SMCs. The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E

5000|$|On April 11, 2010, Pfleger {{delivered}} a 70-minute sermon {{in which he}} said the Apostles [...] "had run out on" [...] Jesus. [...] "They had turned their backs on Him. They had left the One they had been with for three years, 24/7, and they ran away from Him when He most needed them. Only John, {{at the foot of the}} cross, and the women. <b>That's</b> why <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be women priests. <b>That's</b> why <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be married priests. <b>That's</b> why <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be women bishops and women cardinals." [...] The Archdiocese of Chicago later issued a statement by Pfleger in which he apologized for his remarks but reaffirmed his support for women's ordination. Pfleger said on his Facebook fan page that he was told to apologize, despite still holding those opinions. Pfleger denounced critics of his comments as [...] "ignorant haters" [...] who took his homily [...] "out of context" [...] and used them “for their own particular motives”.|$|R

5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E
5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of {{the weasel}} is fatal, {{a thing that}} has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its own self.|$|E
5|$|Vestgrensa {{had served}} the area now served by Forskingsparken since {{the opening of}} the Sognsvann Line on 10 October 1934. In 1991, the Norwegian Parliament decided to build a new {{facility}} for Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, and to serve the hospital by an extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line. Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line of the rapid transit is located within a few hundred meters of the hospital. Vestgrensa was deemed too far away by planners, and a transfer station would need to be established between the light rail and the Sognsvann Line. At first, Blindern was considered, but instead it was later decided <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be an all-new station.|$|E

5000|$|On 16 November 1998, in {{what was}} viewed as a {{declaration}} intended to thwart peace talks, and in particular the implementation of his political rival Benjamin Netanyahu's Wye River agreement with the Palestinian National Authority, the then-Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon urged settler youth to [...] "grab the hilltops", adding, [...] "Everyone <b>that's</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> move, should run, should grab more hills, expand the territory. Everything that's grabbed will be in our hands. Everything we don't grab will be in their hands." ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{there have}} been 61 {{occasions}} on which a batsman has been given out handled the ball in first-class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket. The most recent dismissal of this fashion in first-class cricket occurred during a County Championship contest between Leicestershire and Kent in April 2016, when Kent batsman Sean Dickson was dismissed for the infraction. Brodribb {{suggests that it is}} likely <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> have been a significant number more dismissals than {{there have been}} for handling the ball: in addition to the cases where batsman have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission, there are records of cases in which the umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal. On one such instance, the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed, saying that he thought the appeal was not serious.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E

5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{government}} {{refused to}} carry out death sentences, as the death penalty had been abolished in Italy in 1944 and {{was regarded as a}} relic of Mussolini's Fascist regime. The Italian decision was very disappointing to the British government because the trials had partly been intended to meet the expectations of the Italian public. The War Office notified Lieutenant General Sir John Harding, who had succeeded Alexander as commander of British forces in the Mediterranean in 1946, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be no more death sentences and those already imposed should be commuted. Accordingly, Harding commuted the death sentences imposed on von Mackensen, Mälzer and Kesselring to life imprisonment on 4 July 1947. Mälzer died while still in prison in February 1952, while von Mackensen, after having his sentence reduced to 21 years, was set free in October 1952. Kesselring was moved from Mestre prison near Venice to Wolfsberg, Carinthia, in May 1947. In October 1947 he was transferred for the last time, to Werl Prison, in Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched the idea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode {{had a lot of}} potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
5|$|Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a {{ceremonial}} role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered {{the position to}} Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. Although working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> be a crackdown on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes {{between the two parties}} broke out in the city.|$|E
