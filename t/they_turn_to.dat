5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as they follow a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days.

5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E

5|$|The Powerpuff Girls Movie was {{released}} in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network. The movie, a prequel to the series, {{tells the story of}} how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. After Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium to help the city against crime, they end up only causing chaos in Townsville. Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there to help make people like them again. Unknown to the girls, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's lab chimp helper who was mutated as a cause from the Powerpuff Girls being made and has become super smart as a result and jealous of them. Mojo Jojo ends up tricking the girls into helping him make a machine to mutate other chimps. Seeing what they have done the kids run away in shame but come back after seeing Professor Utonium in trouble, and Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup end up beating Mojo Jojo and his army of mutated smart chimps and saving the day, thus becoming Townsville's new defenders. The movie received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes and received some criticism for the violence involved. In all, the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.|$|E

25|$|Meno now beseeches Socrates {{to return}} to the {{original}} question, how virtue is acquired, and in particular, {{whether or not it is}} acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that virtue is knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, virtue is teachable. <b>They</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the question of whether virtue is indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but there are none.|$|E

25|$|Aeschylus {{continued}} {{his emphasis on}} the polis with The Suppliants in 463 BC (Hiketides), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens {{in advance of the}} establishment of a democratic government in 461. In the play, the Danaids, the fifty daughters of Danaus, founder of Argos, flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. <b>They</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> King Pelasgus of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move {{on the part of the}} king. The people decide that the Danaids deserve protection, and they are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.|$|E
25|$|This Teacher of Righteousness {{does not}} feature at all, however, in the Community Rule, another {{document}} found amongst the Qumran scrolls. To some scholars, {{this suggests that}} the two works are of different Second Temple groups. Most scholars, however, focus on the high degree of shared terminology and legal rulings between the Damascus Document and the Community Rule, including terms like sons of light, and their penal codes and on the likelihood that fragment 4Q265 is a hybrid edition of both documents. <b>They</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the fact that the Damascus Document describes the group amongst whom the Document was created as having been leaderless for 20 years before the Teacher of Righteousness established his rule over the group to explain that both works are from the same group under different situations.|$|E
25|$|Before each mission {{the player}} {{is taken to}} an upgrade screen, where they can spend their honor in three sections: Techniques (passive {{upgrades}} and skills such as new one-hit executions), Distraction Items (such as smoke bombs and firecrackers) and Attack Items (such as caltrops and poison-tipped darts). The next screen allows the player to select any unlocked costumes and equip items. Each costume (except the starting one) gives special bonuses, but also a side effect in order to balance its power, and must be unlocked by completing a number of seals {{in the form of}} optional goals related to the specialty of that costume (for instance, optionally terrorizing enemies in specific ways to unlock a costume which improves the ability to terrorize). Completing the game once unlocks a New Game Plus mode where the enemies behave more intelligently and can kill the player with only a single bullet or hand-to-hand strike, the player's line of sight is limited to a cone aimed in whatever direction the player is facing (preventing players from seeing what is behind, above, or below them unless <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> look), the player is unable to see the enemy's line of sight and must intuit it from the direction an enemy's face is pointed, and the player can no longer detect the radius at which their actions will be heard by enemies.|$|E

Crossing through another {{long stretch of}} residences, the routes cross a railroad track at-grade, where <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, paralleling the tracks until turning north and away once again. NY240 and CR32 bend northwest at Fox Valley Road, intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR86-2 (Buttermilk Road) and the eastern terminus of CR55 (Gooseneck Road) in Ashford. After CR55, the routes bend northwest once again, crossing as a two-lane road through wide fields.|$|E

At times, <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Peter Rabbit (who has gone into business as a florist and keeps a nursery garden), but {{there are days when}} Peter cannot spare cabbages. It is then that the Flopsy Bunnies cross the field to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap of rotten vegetables.|$|E
500|$|The First Lady {{launched}} the [...] "Just Say No" [...] drug awareness campaign in 1982, which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady.

She remarked in 1981 that [...] "Understanding what drugs can do to your children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> drugs is... the first step in solving the problem." [...] Her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse.|$|E

500|$|Sally and Larry {{return to}} the house with several of the DVDs and a {{portable}} DVD player. As Larry starts the playback {{of one of the}} DVDs, Sally discovers she can converse with the Doctor in the past, as he possesses a copy of the complete transcript that is currently being compiled by Larry as he listens. The Doctor explains that he and Martha were transported to 1969 by the Weeping Angels. The Angels are [...] "quantum locked", allowing them to move unbelievably fast when unobserved, while <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> near-indestructible stone when they are observed. As gazing upon themselves will permanently lock them in that form, the Angels otherwise cover their eyes, creating their [...] "weeping" [...] appearance. The Angels feed on the potential time energy generated when they transport their victims to the past, and the Doctor fears they are now seeking the TARDIS' vast reserves of time energy.|$|E
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. <b>They</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a distant}} sound of festive music. The theme {{employed}} {{is that of}} the Danish March (which accompanies the entrance of the royal court in the following Play Scene). The King tells Hamlet to listen {{to the sound of the}} festivities and admonishes him to hold up his head. Hamlet announces he has summoned an itinerant troupe of actors to provide entertainment. Claudius agrees to this, and then says to Gertrude, [...] "He knows nothing!", but she replies [...] "I am afraid!" [...] as <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> leave. The orchestra begins to play the theme of Hamlet's Promise, and Hamlet sings: Mon pére! Patience! Patience! [...] "My father! Patience! Patience!".|$|E
