Every <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt).

500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wesley {{undergoes}} {{yet another}} drastic personality change in Angels fifth season {{following the death}} of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably [...] "unbalanced". [...] "By the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to the last few episodes, he's got a handle on the grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way," [...] says Denisof. [...] "But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart and it makes it possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, the stage is set for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there's nothing more for him to lose." [...] Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a [...] "much deeper, darker place" [...] than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, [...] "The Girl in Question". Denisof continues, They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. And then we would have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having these two people that he was having these strong feelings about. That {{was going to be a}} fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [...] decided to cancel the show. The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley's death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, [...] "It was very upsetting to read. It's too good a story because it hurts." ...|$|E

[...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known {{what we were going to}} do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is. [...] Although that's still kind of a mystery of who is that.
