There are models out there for how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> -- the Mayo Clinic, the Geisinger Clinic in Pennsylvania, the Cleveland Clinic and California's Kaiser Permanente {{are just a few of}} the {{organized}} group practices that are doing a better job for less. Their doctors are better than average at using the best medical evidence available. They're more likely to be using electronic medical records, which can help keep track of patients who have multiple physicians and need complex care. And they're less likely to provide unnecessary care.|$|E

Reviewing 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters dubbed the album [...] "a unique record [...] It's as if they're {{stepping}} in {{to show the}} young bands how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> as songs like 'Bitter Peace', 'Death's Head', and the terrific 'Stain of Mind' blow away anything that young pretenders have put out." [...] Writing in The Guardian, journalist Joel McIver said although the album was as musically heavy and lyrically dark as any of Slayer's previous releases, it exhibited the groove-based style of the then popular nu-metal sound.|$|E

500|$|On September 21, 2011, R.E.M. {{announced}} via {{its website}} {{that it was}} [...] "calling it a day as a band". Stipe said that he hoped fans realized it [...] "wasn't an easy decision": [...] "All things must end, and we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> to do it our way." [...] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband. The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of Around the Sun; according to Mills, [...] "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves, that we could still make great records." [...] They were also uninterested in {{the business end of}} recording as R.E.M. The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post-Collapse into Now sessions. In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.|$|E

6000|$|... [Here I was {{interrupted}} and informed that a stranger wished {{to see me}} down at the door.

And privately I wished the stranger was {{in the bottom of the}} canal with a cargo of wheat on top of him. I was all in a fever, but he was cool. He said he was sorry to disturb me, but as he was passing he noticed that I needed some lightning-rods. I said, [...] "Yes, yes--go on--what about it?" [...] He said there was nothing about it, in particular--nothing except that he would like to put them up for me. I am new to housekeeping; have been used to hotels and boarding-houses all my life. Like anybody else of similar experience, I try to appear (to strangers) to be an old housekeeper; consequently I said in an offhand way that I had been intending for some time to have six or eight lightning-rods put up, but--The stranger started, and looked inquiringly at me, but I was serene. I thought that if I chanced to make any mistakes, he would not catch me by my countenance. He said he would rather have my custom than any man's in town. I said, [...] "All right," [...] and started off to wrestle with my great subject again, when he called me back and said it would be necessary to know exactly how many [...] "points" [...] I wanted put up, what parts of the house I wanted them on, and what quality of rod I preferred. It was close quarters for a man not used to the exigencies of housekeeping; but I went through creditably, and he probably never suspected that I was a novice. I told him to put up eight [...] "points," [...] and put them all on the roof, and use the best quality of rod. He said he could furnish the [...] "plain" [...] article at 20 cents a foot; [...] "coppered," [...] 25 cents; [...] "zinc-plated spiral-twist," [...] at 30 cents, that would stop a streak of lightning any time, no matter where it was bound, and [...] "render its errand harmless and its further progress apocryphal." [...] I said apocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanating from the source it did, but, philology aside, I liked the spiral-twist and would take that brand. Then he said he could make two hundred and fifty feet answer; but <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> and make the best job in town of it, and attract the admiration of the just and the unjust alike, and compel all parties to say they never saw a more symmetrical and hypothetical display of lightning-rods since they were born, he supposed he really couldn't get along without four hundred, though he was not vindictive, and trusted he was willing to try. I said, go ahead and use four hundred, and make any kind of a job he pleased out of it, but let me get back to my work.
