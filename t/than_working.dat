5|$|On January 14, 1964, {{players in}} the newer league formed the AFL Players Association, and elected linebacker Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots as president. Rather <b>than</b> <b>working</b> with the AFLPA, the NFLPA chose to remain apart and tried to block the merger between the two leagues in 1966, though lack of funding {{prevented}} it from mounting a formal challenge. With the merger complete, the players could no longer use the leverage {{of being able to}} sign with an AFL team to attain more money.|$|E
5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a bootleg. Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} {{any information about}} the artists or names of the tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining the anonymous track list rather <b>than</b> <b>working</b> to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely available on the Internet {{and the opportunity to}} collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton and Stamford branches of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) discovers that an employee named Martin Nash (Wayne Wilderson), who came with the branches' recent merger, was previously in prison. Michael becomes frustrated when Martin's stories of prison sound better <b>than</b> <b>working</b> in the office. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) plays a prank on Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) by giving incorrect information to Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) on how to impress her.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} on the higher plateau is widely dispersed in small farms and hamlets, but, rather <b>than</b> <b>working</b> in agriculture or forestry, most people now commute to employment in surrounding cities and towns. The largest {{village on the}} plateau on the western Mendips is Priddy, which had a population of 624people {{at the time of}} the 2011 census along with the smaller hamlet of Charterhouse. The larger villages and towns are on the lower slopes of the western hills, often in river valleys. Axbridge, with a population of 2,057, and Cheddar (population 5,755), both within the Sedgemoor district and the Mendip town of Shepton Mallet (10,369), and the city of Wells (10,636) are along the southern border of the hills. The North Somerset parishes of Blagdon (1,116), and the parishes of Compton Martin (508), East Harptree (644) and West Harptree (439), lie along the northern edge.|$|E
5|$|Returning to education, Mao {{enrolled}} {{and dropped}} out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school and an economics school. His father only approved of the latter, but the lectures were in English, which Mao didn't understand, and so Mao abandoned it for the government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon {{dropped out of}} this too, finding it rooted in Confucianism. Undertaking his studies independently, he spent {{much time in the}} Changsha public library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Charles Darwin, J.S. Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Herbert Spencer. Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better <b>than</b> <b>working</b> people. Inspired by the work of Friedrich Paulsen, the liberal emphasis on individualism led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for the greater good; that the end justifies the means. Seeing no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance, forcing Mao to move into a hostel for the destitute.|$|E
5|$|Saavedro is the {{antagonist}} of Exile. Depicted as a vengeful {{and broken}} man, Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan, {{one of the}} Ages chosen by Atrus to try to teach his sons Sirrus and Achenar about the Art of writing books linking to other worlds. Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus' sons, but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed from within. When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J'nanin, he is assaulted and left for dead. Trapped on J'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead, Saavedro's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity. When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in hope of finding the brothers, he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge. Once on Narayan, Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed. Cornered by the Stranger, Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book. In the game's optimal ending, the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan, before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus. Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif, who accepted the role of Saavedro {{because he was a}} Myst fan. Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult <b>than</b> <b>working</b> on movie sets, as he could not see the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{stoppages}} across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, when more <b>than</b> 29million <b>working</b> days had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of}} the miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more <b>than</b> 27million <b>working</b> days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer <b>than</b> 2million <b>working</b> days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|R

40|$|Forty F 1 {{crossbred}} dairy cows, 20 Friesian x Boran and 20 Simmental x Boran, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (non working-non supplemented, non working-supplemented, working-non supplemented, and working-supplemented) {{were used}} to study the effect of work and diet supplementation on roughage intake, digestibility of nutrients, and nitrogen balance. Dry matter intake were greater for <b>working</b> <b>than</b> non <b>working</b> cows. Work and supplementation increased dry matter and organic matter in vivo digestibility. Passage rate and rumen mean retention of Cr-mordanted hay were similar for working and non working cows. Liquid turnover rate was lower and rumen liquid mean retention time was greater in <b>working</b> <b>than</b> non <b>working</b> cows whether supplemented or not. Nitrogen balance was negative for non supplemented cows during working periods compared to the same cows during rest periods. This seems to reflect mainly greater urine nitrogen excretion in working supplemented cows. Digesta kinetics could explain only partially the possible mechanisms responsible for greater roughage intake and digestibility in working cows...|$|R

Saumoneau and Renaud were admitted somewhat reluctantly. While the attendees had no difficulty supporting a resolution that called for an eight-hour day for industrial workers, with a full day off, they had considerable difficulty supporting a proposal that their own maids should get the same conditions. Saumoneau and Renaud pushed the point.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{first arrived}} at Guaymas {{in the late}} 19th century and congregated there and in Hermosillo. Over the {{following}} decades, they moved into growing communities such as Magdalena and Cananea. Rather <b>than</b> <b>working</b> in the fields, most started their own small businesses, networking with other Chinese. These business spanned {{a wide range of}} industries from manufacturing to retail sales of nearly every type of merchandise. The Chinese in Sonora not only become successful shopkeepers, they eventually came to control local small businesses {{in many areas of the}} state. By 1910, the Chinese population in Sonora was 4,486 out of a total population of 265,383, making them the largest foreign presence in the state, with only North Americans a close second at 3,164. Almost none were female, as there were only 82 Chinese females in the entire country at the time. The Chinese population reached its peak in 1919 with 6,078 people, again with almost no Chinese women.|$|E

25|$|Near graduation, {{he applied}} for a {{research}} job at Bell Labs, which he received. After a year to establish himself there, he married Maude Rosenbaum, whom he had met in St. Louis and dated while at Purdue. The work Mueller did at Bell Labs deferred him from being drafted into the military during World War II. He initially researched orthicon technology, but, as Bell Labs geared up for war, it later became heavily involved in airborne radar technology. As the war progressed, his group was given the task of building the first airborne radar for Bell. Ultimately, the radar designed by MIT was chosen over the Bell Labs system, but not until after Mueller became spectacularly sick while flight testing Bell Labs' radar {{on a visit to}} Wright Airfield in Ohio. He continued his work on magnetrons and said he came close to co-inventing the transistor. If he and his co-workers had placed their contacts on a single crystal of zircon rather <b>than</b> <b>working</b> with multiple crystals, they would have beaten Shockley's team, also at Bell Labs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{critics of}} the Mudawana point out that {{irrespective}} {{of the value of}} the reforms themselves, the process by which they were achieved is flawed, creates difficulties for their implementation, and can even be considered counter-productive to the process of democratization. It can be argued that while the reforms do represent a significant transformation of women’s rights, they also serve to solidify and expand the authority of the monarch as the defender or insurer of those rights. In the end, the civil society associations that lobbied for the reforms had to work within the existing authoritarian system, appealing directly to the king for change rather <b>than</b> <b>working</b> through a democratic political process. Ultimately, the credit for the reforms' successful enactment has been given to the monarchy. Finally, some characterize the high degree of debate and deliberation over the issue as a dividing influence in the end; a representative from one Moroccan women’s organization described the women’s movement in Morocco not as a movement, but an uncoordinated group of different organizations.|$|E

50|$|The precise {{effect of}} {{inlining}} on cache performance is complicated. For small cache sizes (much smaller <b>than</b> the <b>working</b> set prior to expansion), the increased sequentiality dominates, and inlining improves cache performance. For cache sizes {{close to the}} working set, where inlining expands the working set so it no longer fits in cache, this dominates and cache performance decreases. For cache sizes larger <b>than</b> the <b>working</b> set, inlining has negligible impact on cache performance. Further, changes in cache design, such as load forwarding, can offset the increase in cache misses.|$|R
