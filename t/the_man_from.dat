5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> London was {{the first}} of Tarr's films to premiere in {{competition}} at the Cannes Film Festival, but despite being highly anticipated, it won no prize. The French distributor blamed this on poor dubbing and a late showing, though the press were put off by the film's extended shots and leaden pace. After being re-dubbed, it was shown on the international film festival circuit.|$|E

5|$|A machinima short film, titled Red Dead Redemption: <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> Blackwater, {{aired on}} the {{television}} network Fox on May 29, 2010. Directed by John Hillcoat, the film retells several of the game's earlier missions in which Marston attempts to find and kill Bill Williamson. Rockstar also developed a Facebook application based on the game, titled Red Dead Redemption: Gunslingers. Released on April 12, 2010, the game was a role-playing social game that allowed players to duel their friends; {{it is no longer}} available, due to updates on the Facebook platform.|$|E

5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} were erected on {{the site}} of the massacre in 1955, as was a monument by the sculptor Vojin Bakić. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence during the Croatian War of Independence, the monument and the mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists, as was another one of Bakić's works, Bjelovarac (<b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>From</b> Bjelovar). The ruins of the ossuary were removed by the local authorities in 2002. That same year, residents signed a petition to have the Bjelovarac monument erected once again. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{contact in}} the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), insists that Black should not get {{involved}} in the case as he is too close to the victims. However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> the airport footage.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's second non-fiction {{book was}} {{published}} in November 1963: Thrilling Cities, a reprint {{of a series of}} Sunday Times articles based on Fleming's impressions of a number of world cities in trips taken during 1959 and 1960. Approached in 1964 by producer Norman Felton to write a spy series for television, Fleming provided several ideas, including the names of characters Napoleon Solo and April Dancer, for the series <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> U.N.C.L.E. However, Fleming withdrew from the project following a request from Eon Productions, who were keen to avoid any legal problems that might occur if the project overlapped with the Bond films.|$|E

5|$|Global sales {{rights to}} the film were bought by Fortissimo Films, and it was re-dubbed in French and English. The new version had its North American premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in September 2008. In the United Kingdom, {{distributor}} Artificial Eye released the film theatrically in December 2008, 18 months following its Cannes premiere. They later released a DVD box set of Tarr's films which collected <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> London with Damnation (1988) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000). In the United States the film was given a limited release in May 2009 by IFC Films, who later made it available through video-on-demand.|$|E

The man, Philip Michael Gerard (Al Strobel) is a traveling salesman, who denies any involvement or that he knows BOB.|$|E
5|$|Homer's {{escape from}} the {{overturned}} paddy wagon is a homage to the 1993 film The Fugitive. Chief Wiggum's dream in which Lisa speaks backwards is reference to Twin Peaks and Special Agent Dale Cooper's interaction with <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> Another Place. While recording Lisa's lines for the segment, Yeardley Smith recorded the part backwards; the recording was in turn reversed, a technique known as phonetic reversal, the same technique used on Twin Peaks. Several other parts out of the segment are direct references to the dream, including a moving shadow on the curtain, and Wiggum's hair standing straight up after waking.|$|E

5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing {{the failure of the}} first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E
5|$|The theater film, <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> Galveston (1963), was the {{original}} pilot episode of the proposed NBC western television series Temple Houston, with Jeffrey Hunter cast as Temple Lea Houston, a lawyer and the youngest son of the legendary Sam Houston. For a time the real Temple Houston was the county attorney of Brazoria County, Texas. The Temple Houston series lasted for only twenty-six episodes in the 1963-1964 television season.|$|E
5|$|Wild Brumbies {{are also}} used in the Brumby catch and handle event in stockman’s {{challenge}} competitions, where riders are required to catch a free running Brumby from their horse within a time limit of a few minutes. Sectional points are awarded for the stockman’s challenge for care and skill in catching the Brumby {{and their ability to}} teach them to lead. These demanding challenges for riders are held in New South Wales at Dalgety, Tamworth and Murrurundi plus <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>From</b> Snowy River Challenge in Corryong, Victoria. Several New South Wales show societies, including Walcha, Bellingen and Dorrigo, hold special classes for registered Brumbies at their annual agricultural shows.|$|E

5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} {{were built}} {{on the site of}} the massacre in 1955. A monument called Gudovac—Before the Firing Squad, by the Serb sculptor Vojin Bakić, was erected on the same spot. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence caused by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars, the monument and mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists. Also destroyed was one of Bakić's most famous monuments, Bjelovarac (<b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> Bjelovar). Bakić had dedicated the monument to his brothers, who were killed by the Ustaše. What remained of the ossuary was removed by the local authorities in 2002. That year, residents signed a petition to have a replica of Bjelovarac erected at the same spot. The local government promised to supply half the amount needed to restore the monument. In 2005, the Croatian Ministry of Culture advised the petitioners to apply for a tender in order to pay the other half. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy X-2, set {{two years}} after Final Fantasy X, Yuna {{is a member of}} the sphere hunting group Gullwings, along with Rikku and Paine. In the game's {{international}} version, the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game's opening, with Yuna returning to Besaid Island. The trio then reunite to explore a tower. In X-2, Yuna journeys to Spira in search of the truth behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison. During her journey, Yuna discovers <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> the sphere was actually Shuyin, a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover, Lenne. The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne's spirit. Depending on the player's progress throughout the game, the Fayth may revive Tidus so that she can reunite with him. The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Yuna becomes a part of the group called Yevoners whose main temple is located on Besaid. In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling him she loves somebody else before declaring she will fight Sin once again.|$|E
5|$|Jagger {{has also}} had an {{intermittent}} acting career, most well-known {{for his role in}} Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. Jagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry the original performer from its run on London's West End. The same year he was approached by director Alejandro Jodorowsky {{to play the role of}} Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, but the movie never made it to the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978 and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, in the late 1970s. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>From</b> Elysian Fields (2002).|$|E

5|$|Over {{much of her}} childhood, Michelena’s parents toured {{with the}} Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company a {{traveling}} theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences. Beatriz's father in later life taught music {{and worked as a}} vocal coach and, {{at the time of his}} death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco. Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> China (1904). Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco, California to teach voice. There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques. He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the way to move as another person, the way to make simple but authoritative gestures, and the way to build intensity over the span of a performance. Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was gaining}} adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim {{was not to}} enter politics, but to persuade {{existing}} parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The night before, he organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province: <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> Mars, who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist {{in the midst of}} plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart's characters, the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer, did not make an appearance; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism.|$|E
5|$|While the production's lawyers {{worked to}} clarify its legal {{standing}} in the Summer of 2005, it emerged that Humbert Balsan's deeply indebted production company Ognon Pictures had pledged all rights to the production to Coficiné in exchange for loans. With production in legal stasis and faced with a lengthy court battle to recover the rights, the producers agreed to a settlement with Ognon's bankruptcy officer. In the meantime, the French partners Mezzanine Film declared their uncomfortableness with {{the scale of the}} production, and after mutual agreement with the producers, left the project on September 5, 2005. After meeting with the producers and their new French partner, Paul Saadoun of 13 Production, Coficiné consented to completing the film. On February 6, 2006, Tarr and producer Gábor Téni issued a press release which documented at length the developments with the troubled production to that date, and expressed their hope and intent to persevere in completing the film. Tarr duly restarted shooting in March 2006, after a year of inactivity. The filmmakers dedicated <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>from</b> London to their late colleague Humbert Balsan.|$|E
