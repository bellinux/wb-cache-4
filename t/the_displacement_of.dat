5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} the vibration performance of medium-speed mill-foundation coupled system, eight mills in five thermal power plants {{were tested in}} site. <b>The</b> vibration <b>displacement</b> and acceleration <b>of</b> upper and lower bedplates of foundations and equipment bodies were measured. According to the test results, the vibration safety of mills is evaluated. The study shows that <b>the</b> vibration <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> medium-speed mill with spring vibration-isolated foundation meets the code requirements, but <b>the</b> vibration <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> equipment body is larger. <b>The</b> vibration <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> equipment body should be controlled by limiting <b>the</b> vibration <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> foundation platform in design...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely.

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} is essentially <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> a contact line {{such as the}} one in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. <b>The</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220.

5|$|The Arima {{study is}} based on 761 {{municipalities}} located in the Legal Amazon of Brazil, and found that between 2003 and 2008, soybean areas expanded by 39,100km² in the basin's agricultural areas, mainly in Mato Grosso. The model showed that a 10% (3,910km²) reduction of soy in old pasture areas would {{have led to a}} reduction in deforestation of up to 40% (26,039km²) in heavily forested municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis showed that <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> cattle production due to agricultural expansion drives land use change in municipalities located hundreds of kilometers away, and that the Amazonian ILUC is not only measurable but its impact is significant.|$|E

5|$|The offensives were {{accompanied}} by <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> most of the Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the majority were soon settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed ethnic cleansing and civil-rights abuses. These accusations were contested by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). A month after the operation, the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E

The entire region was recaptured by the HV in Operation Tiger and the Battle of Konavle by the end of 1992. The offensive {{resulted in}} <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> 15,000 people, mainly from Konavle, who fled to Dubrovnik. Approximately 16,000 refugees were evacuated from Dubrovnik by sea, and the city was resupplied by blockade-evading runabouts and a convoy of civilian vessels. More than 11,000 buildings were damaged and numerous homes, businesses, and public buildings were looted or torched.|$|E
30|$|When the MD {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out for every 50 Δt, <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> topmost FE nodes were calculated through <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> atoms around <b>the</b> FE nodes. <b>The</b> <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> these FE nodes were then used as initial conditions for FE calculations. Quasi-static elastic constitutive relationship and Newton–Raphson iteration were employed due to that <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FE region were very small compared {{with those in the}} MD region. When FE calculation was finished, <b>the</b> <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> atoms on <b>the</b> bottom layer could be obtained according to their positions in the corresponding elements, and the positions of the atoms were updated by using their displacements. So, one could obtain a new MD region and perform MD simulations again. More detailed working processes about multiscale method were given in Ref. [22].|$|R

5|$|Amy was {{considered}} one of the worst typhoons to strike the Philippines on record. Making its initial landfall along with the concurrent eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin, the typhoon disrupted volcanic relief operations and forced <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> victims already displaced by the volcano. Cebu City suffered the worst impacts of Amy– most of the city's buildings were heavily damaged, and 29people died in the city. Strong winds and rainfall in the city associated with Amy also set records which still remain unbroken today. Damage there was estimated at 560million Philippine pesos. Along the east coast of Leyte, where Amy initially struck, ninety percent of homes were destroyed, and a large swath of coconut plantations were wiped out. In Panay, located on the western side of the Philippines, at least a thousand homes were destroyed in 41towns. Overall, Amy caused $30million in damage, and at least 556fatalities, though the final death toll may have been as high as 991, making the typhoon one of the deadliest in modern Philippine history. An additional 50,000people were displaced.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E
