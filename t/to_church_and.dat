25|$|The Tories were a {{more likely}} source of support given their {{commitment}} <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> king, but many were reluctant to trust the Church of England to a Catholic king. At times such as 1715–1722 when the Hanoverians appeared to be dismantling Anglican dominance and 1743–1745 when Whig dealings denied the Tories a parliamentary victory they would coalesce and turn to the Jacobites, but they were reluctant {{when it came to}} serious action. Nevertheless, this gave hopes that large numbers of Tories would support a Jacobite rising with a serious prospect of winning, particularly when helped by foreign intervention. The {{rise and fall of the}} earlier Tory alliance with the Jacobites forms a major part of the background for Sir Walter Scott's Bride of Lammermoor.|$|E

She went <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> said her rosary, but {{she was just a}} normal little girl."

[...] Apart from evangelism, Christian metal may also provide a means [...] "to get away from the image of Christianity as something rigid and boring".|$|E

500|$|Spacey {{loosely based}} Lester's early [...] "schlubby" [...] deportment on Walter Matthau. During the film, Lester's {{physique}} improves from flabby to toned; Spacey worked out during filming {{to improve his}} body, but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order, Spacey varied postures to portray the stages. Before filming, Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lemmon's performance in The Apartment(1960), because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate [...] "the way [...] moved, the way he looked, {{the way he was}} in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man". Spacey's voiceover is a throwback to Sunset Boulevard(1950), which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character. Mendes felt it evoked Lester's—and the film's—loneliness. Bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance: [...] "I used to babysit constantly. You'd go <b>to</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> see how people present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference." [...] Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a [...] "PTA president coif" [...] hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail-order catalogs to better establish Carolyn's environment of a [...] "spotless suburban manor". To help Bening get into Carolyn's mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like. He lent Bening the Bobby Darin version of the song [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade", which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car.|$|E
