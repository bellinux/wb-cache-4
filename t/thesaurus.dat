The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes {{was published in the}} Initial Teaching Alphabet in 1966 and in Dutch as Het Verhaal van Timmie Tuimelaar in 1968 under licence to Uitgeverij Ploegsma, Amsterdam. The tale was published in Spanish by Grange Books in 1997, and a German <b>Thesaurus</b> edition intended for German ESL and English GSL students in 2009. The <b>Thesaurus</b> edition was printed in English with translations of difficult or unusual words and expressions located in footnotes. In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} applications of matrices, both {{in mathematics and}} other sciences. Some of them merely {{take advantage of the}} compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix. For example, in game theory and economics, the payoff matrix encodes the payoff for two players, depending on which out of a given (finite) set of alternatives the players choose. Text mining and automated <b>thesaurus</b> compilation makes use of document-term matrices such as tf-idf to track frequencies of certain words in several documents.|$|E
30|$|It is {{necessary}} to determine a reasonable separation factor for the extraction and separation of the gender-specific <b>thesauruses.</b> In this paper, the separation factor is increased from 1.1 to 4.0 with a step size of 0.1, and 40 pairs of different gender-specific <b>thesauruses</b> are constructed. Based on these 40 pairs of different proprietary <b>thesauruses</b> with the 15 features mentioned in 3.2 to 3.4, 40 different experimental data were obtained. By sequentially validating the 40 data sets using the selected machine learning methods, a suitable separation factor can be obtained, which gives the best effect for gender identification.|$|R

5|$|Rand {{worked long}} hours through 1942 to {{complete}} the final two-thirds of her manuscript, which she delivered on December 31, 1942. Rand's working title for the book was Second-Hand Lives, but Ogden pointed out that this emphasized the story's villains. Rand offered The Mainspring as an alternative, but this title had been recently used for another book. She then used a <b>thesaurus</b> and found 'fountainhead' as a synonym. The Fountainhead was published on May 7, 1943, with 7,500 copies in the first printing. Initial sales were slow, but they began to rise {{in the fall of}} 1943, driven primarily by word of mouth. The novel began appearing on bestseller lists in 1944. It reached number six on The New York Times bestseller list in August 1945, over two years after its initial publication. By 1956, the hardcover edition sold over 700,000 copies. The first paperback edition was published by New American Library in 1952.|$|E

New terms and synonyms are added weekly. Work on the SafetyLit <b>thesaurus</b> is not finished, so the full hierarchical search system is not yet complete. However, some term hierarchies such as geographic area names are available for searching.

40|$|Sentiment lexicons are {{the most}} used tool to {{automatically}} predict sentiment in text. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there exist no openly available sentiment lexicons for the Norwegian language. Thus in this paper we applied two different strategies to automatically generate sentiment lexicons for the Norwegian language. The first strategy used machine translation to translate an English sentiment lexicon to Norwegian and the other strategy used information from three different <b>thesauruses</b> to build several sentiment lexicons. The lexicons based on <b>thesauruses</b> were built using the Label propagation algorithm from graph theory. The lexicons were evaluated by classifying product and movie reviews. The results show satisfying classification performances. Different sentiment lexicons perform well on product and on movie reviews. Overall the lexicon based on machine translation performed the best, showing that linguistic resources in English can be translated to Norwegian without losing significant value. ...|$|R
