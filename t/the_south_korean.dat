5|$|In January 1953, IX Corps was reorganized for {{the last}} time and now {{consisted}} entirely of South Korean forces. It retained command of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> 3rd Infantry Division and Capital Division, and gained command of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> 9th Infantry Division. The corps maintained a position around Chorwon, flanked to the west by I Corps and to the east by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> II Corps. Though <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> II Corps saw a major attack against its lines in July 1953, IX Corps and its divisions only fought in limited engagements, usually with company-sized formations attacking or defending fortified positions against the Chinese {{until the end of the}} war. No major attacks against the corps were conducted through 1953, until the armistice was signed in July, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|The goal of American {{armed forces}} was to {{reinforce}} the remnants of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army (ROK) in fighting back the North Korean invasion (but only in the southeastern part of South Korea, around the major seaport of Pusan) to prevent the complete collapse of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army and of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Government. However, the American armed forces in the Orient had been decreasing steadily {{since the end of}} World War II, by mid-1950, there were no American troops in South Korea, and the American force in Japan had dwindled drastically.|$|E

50|$|The North Korean {{patrol boat}} PT-381 found itself being bumped by two <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> fast craft simultaneously, one hitting {{it in the}} stern {{and the other in}} the side. At 09:28, the crew of PT-381 fired machine guns and 25 mm cannon at <b>the</b> two <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> fast craft. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> retaliated with a 20 mm Gatling gun and 40 mm and 76 mm weapons. During the next {{fourteen}} minutes, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> fired a total of 4,584 rounds of ammunition before breaking off the engagement.|$|R
50|$|South Korea's President Syngman Rhee {{had been}} {{reluctant}} about the Armistice talks {{to begin with}} and was particularly opposed to any involuntary repatriation of former <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> to North Korea. Many other <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> leaders had also been unhappy with the ceasefire negotiations in general {{as well as the}} issue of anti-communist POWs in UN custody. The tensions between <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> and their UN allies erupted when <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> unilaterally released 25,000 anti-Communist POWs on June 18 of 1953.|$|R

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the valley between Taegu and P'ohong-dong, the terrain along the line was extremely rough and mountainous thanks to the Taebaek Mountains which ran from north to south down Korea's east coast. Northeast of P'ohong-dong along <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the northern line of the Pusan Perimeter using the terrain as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces.|$|E

5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> and American armies.

For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E

50|$|The {{unilateral}} {{release of}} the anti-Communist POWs by <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> complicated negotiations. Doing so without resolving <b>the</b> issue of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> MIA missing from the POW lists from the Communist forces may have been detrimental to the POWs that were held in North Korea. However, {{the fact that the}} communists began with such a small list of POWs indicated that they had little intention of returning many of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the eastern}} battles {{during the first}} two weeks of September, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> troops, {{demoralized}} though they were, did most of the ground fighting. American tanks, artillery, and ground units supported them. Uncontested UN aerial supremacy and naval gunfire from offshore also supported <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> troops, and probably were the factors that tipped the scales in their favor. After the initial phase of their September offensive, the North Koreans labored under what proved to be insurmountable difficulties in supplying their forward units. The North Korean system of supply could not resolve the problems of logistics and communication necessary to support and exploit an offensive operation in this sector of the front. Nevertheless, the breakthrough was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days, eventually deciding to stand its ground.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 25, 1950, 10 {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. Advancing with 89,000 men in six columns, the North Koreans caught <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army by surprise, resulting in a disastrous rout for the South Koreans who were disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the South Koreans who could muster just 38,000 men to the front-line to oppose them. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the capital Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw further southwards.|$|E
5|$|Responding to Peng's {{concern over}} the troops' conditions, Mao limited {{the scope of the}} Third Phase Campaign to pin down <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces along the 38th {{parallel}} while inflicting as much damage as possible. Upon noticing that the US units were not interspersed between <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> formations, therefore unable to support the South Koreans, Mao ordered the PVA 13th Army to destroy the ROK 1st Infantry Division, the ROK 6th Infantry Division and the ROK III Corps. Following Mao's instruction, Peng placed the PVA 38th, 39th, 40th and 50th Corps of the 13th Army in front of the ROK 1st and 6th Infantry Division, while the 42nd and the 66th Corps of the 13th Army were moved into ROK III Corps' sector. The start date of the offensive was set to 31 December in order {{to take advantage of the}} night assault under a full moon and the anticipated low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday. For the same reasons Ridgway had predicted that 31 December would be the likely time for the new Chinese offensive. Believing that the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces at the 38th parallel would render the UN forces incapable of counterattacks in the future, Mao promised to pull all Chinese troops off the front line for rest and refit by the end of the campaign.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were holding}} {{positions}} at {{the northern end of}} the Kapyong Valley, having advanced [...] since relieving the 27th Brigade. However, anticipating a Chinese attack, the divisional commander—General Chang Do Yong—had halted his advance at 16:00 and ordered his two forward regiments—the 19th and the 2nd Infantry Regiments—to tie-in and develop defensive positions. Meanwhile, the 7th Infantry Regiment occupied reserve positions immediately behind the forward regiments. Suffering a reputation for unreliability in defence <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> had been bolstered by the attachment of the New Zealand guns and a battery of [...] M101 howitzers from the US 213th Field Artillery Battalion. Regardless, left with only one hour to halt its advance and step up defences, <b>the</b> forward <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> units were only able to occupy a series of hill-top positions while leaving the valleys and flanks exposed. Two Chinese divisions—the 118th and the 60th Division—struck at 17:00, easily infiltrating through numerous gaps between the badly organised defensive positions. Under pressure all along the front, the defenders gave ground almost immediately and soon broke. Abandoning their weapons, equipment and vehicles, they disintegrated and began to stream <b>south</b> out of <b>the</b> mountains and through the valley, and by 23:00 Chang was forced to admit that he had lost all communication with his units. At 04:00 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the New Zealanders to prevent their loss, however following reports that <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> were making a stand they were ordered back up the valley the next morning with the Middlesex accompanying them as protection. By dusk it was clear that <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> had in fact collapsed, and the guns were withdrawn again.|$|R
5|$|At noon on October 30, the 15th Corps bombarded the Koreans with 133 large-caliber guns, 22 rocket {{launchers}} and 30 120mm heavy mortars in {{the largest}} Chinese artillery operation of the Korean War. When the bombardment ended at midnight, 10 infantry companies from the 45th and the 29th Divisions swarmed over the ROK 31st Regiment's positions and pushed <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> off <b>the</b> summit. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, only 175 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> survived <b>the</b> onslaught out of the three defending infantry companies. With the PVA 91st Regiment of the 31st Division, 12th Corps, arriving as reinforcement on November 1, the Chinese forces chased <b>the</b> remaining <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> defenders off Jane Russell Hill and beat off the subsequent counterattack. Responding to the losses, the US IX Corps ordered the ROK 30th Regiment of the ROK 9th Infantry Division to take back Triangle Hill on October 31. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> launched continuous attacks for the next five days to no avail. Although <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> failed to recapture the hill, the resulting heavy casualties forced the Chinese to call in the 93rd Regiment of the 31st Division as reinforcement on November 5. On the same day, Lieutenant General Reuben E. Jenkins, commander of the US IX Corps, suspended further attacks on Triangle Hill to prevent more casualties and to protect Sniper Ridge.|$|R

5|$|Though it was {{steadily}} pushed back, South Korean {{forces on}} the right flank increased their resistance further south hoping to delay North Korean units as much as possible. North and South Korean units sparred for control of several cities, inflicting heavy casualties on one another. The Republic of Korea Army forces defended Yongdok fiercely before being forced back. They also performed well in the Battle of Andong, forcing the NK 12th Division to delay their attacks on P'ohang-dong until the early August. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces had also undergone significant reorganizations, and after receiving {{a large number of}} recruits by 26 July, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army had reached an effective strength of 85,871 men.|$|E
