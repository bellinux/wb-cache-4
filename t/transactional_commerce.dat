40|$|Public key {{technology}} presumes {{the availability of}} certificates and certifying authorities (CAs) living within a shallow hierarchy rooted at a few (n << 100) public CAs. We propose an alternative that lessens the day-today dependence on centralized CAs while deepening the certificate tree. We dothis by suggesting that smartcards provide CA functions, thus re-framing some payment problems as simpler authorization problems. 1. Rationale by way of introduction Smartcards will, beyond any doubt, dominate all commerce and will be how electronic commerce and conventional commerce merge into a single commerce. Irresistible global forces are behind this, and no one company has either the mass or the momentum to change it. Getting it right will have historical significance. We think we have — we encapsulate <b>transactional</b> <b>commerce</b> in public key certificates issued by token devices. These ubiquitous, persona...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{businesses}} {{large and small}} have jumped on the Social Commerce bandwagon, all {{in the hope of}} utilising social media services to facilitate various Social Commerce activities. Given the growing influence of social media on social, economic and political events globally, the rise in business interest in Social Commerce is not unexpected. This paper examines the Social Commerce activities of several Fortune 500 businesses. It analyses and categorises how businesses utilise social media to interact with customers, trading partners, employees and other important stakeholders. Two important themes have emerged, firstly, businesses utilise social media services mostly to facilitate Pre- and Post-transactional type Social Commerce activities such as marketing and customer support. Opportunities exist for businesses to leverage social media for <b>transactional</b> type Social <b>Commerce</b> activities such as purchase, payment, and order-fulfilment. Secondly, the business use of social media seems haphazard. Stakeholders wishing to succeed in Social Commerce will have to reformulate their strategies to take advantage of how users behave on social media services and opportunities to draw synergy from utilising an assortment of social media services. The paper contributes to theory by developing a taxonomy of Social Commerce activities. It contributes to practice by highlighting opportunities to engage in Social Commerce activities, in particular, to leverage opportunities from implementing <b>Transactional</b> Social <b>Commerce.</b> <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Replication is {{commonly}} used to address the scalability and availability requirements of collaborative web applications in domains such as computer supported cooperative work, social networking, e-commerce and e-banking. While providing substantial benefits, replication also introduces the overhead of maintaining data consistent among the replicated servers. In this work we study the performance of common replication approaches with various consistency guarantees and argue for the feasibility of strong consistency. We propose an efficient, distributed, strong consistency protocol and reveal experimentally that its overhead is not prohibitive. We have implemented a replication middleware that offers different consistency protocols, including our strong consistency protocol. We use the TPC-W <b>transactional</b> web <b>commerce</b> benchmark to provide a comprehensive performance comparison of the different replication approaches {{under a variety of}} workload mixes.

40|$|Purpose - Given the {{proliferation}} of mobile devices, m-commerce is expected to experience asubstantial growth. However, most m-commerce applications {{except for a few}} have failed to meetexpectations. In this study, the authors aim to examine specific factors pertaining to the individualadoption of B 2 C <b>transactional</b> mobile <b>commerce.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive framework integrating well establishedtheories of technology adoption i. e. the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory ofplanned behaviour (TPB) is developed. More specifically, perceived usefulness is re-conceptualizedto enhance the specificity of these theories to mobile commerce. The resulting model is empiricallytested with mobile device users who have not adopted mobile commerce yet. Findings - The empirical results provide strong support for the integrative approach, shedding lighton the significance and relative importance of specific technological characteristics. The theoreticaland empirical implications of these results are discussed. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the need to develop the innovation diffusion theoryand TAM further by including the effects of social influence and individual characteristic variables. Furthermore, the paper also shows the usefulness of accounting for the specificity of the IT artifact ingeneral and m-commerce applications in particular. In this study, the specificity of the IT artifact isaccounted for by decomposing perceived usefulness into specific considerations that are relevant tom-commerce adoption. Such an approach presents a major advantage. Indeed, the significance andmagnitude of the formative measures show which characteristics of m-commerce are adoption drivers...|$|R

Mobile operators {{are looking for ways to}} complement their traditional revenue streams, as they cannot merely rely on voice and short message service (SMS) income anymore. Mobile value-added services are a good addition to the portfolio, bringing much needed services like <b>transactional</b> banking, <b>commerce,</b> information and entertainment, insurance, and health information services to mobile users that had difficult to no access to the above services until recently. South African mobile value-added services (VAS) companies that have a good relationship with market leading mobile providers, like MTN, have the opportunity to tap into the Ghanaian market as these services predominantly consist of mobile financial services products with limited functionality. Other specific services like agriculture, health, entertainment and insurance have been identified as mobile subscriber needs in the Ghanaian market. The benefit that South African mobile value-added companies have is that they already have developed similar well-functioning value-added services for the local market where comparisons with the Ghanaian market dynamics can be found. These companies can tailor them to the specific needs and requirements of the market in Ghana, saving them time and having the much-needed first mover advantage with regards to new or better mobile VAS in this market. Ghana is seen as the most stable country in the West African region and ease of doing business is good in comparison with neighbouring countries like Nigeria. Ghana is therefore a good entry point for South African mobile VAS companies in the West African market to truly scale their business model. The researcher chose to investigate the opportunities and best ways to enter this market by interviewing a project manager and managing director of a leading mobile value-added services company doing business in emerging economies, including Ghana. Questionnaires were also sent to employees working for various mobile VAS employers with extensive experience in the research and development of mobile VAS in these markets. The researcher derived information on the difficulty of doing business in Ghana; the current available VAS in the Ghanaian market; factors that hinder business growth in this market specifically; drivers of success; the importance of partnering with leading mobile operators like MTN to be successful; how the South African business model can be compatible; South African and other African trends that will most likely overflow to Ghana; together with the size data-enabled VAS which will form part of the portfolio of products that mobile VAS companies can offer and be market ready for in the near future. The findings of the researcher can be used as a starting framework to further investigate and determine specific market size and to conduct in-depth market analysis of the needs and requirements of mobile subscribers with regards to mobile VAS in Ghana with the vision of moving into the rest of Western Africa...|$|R
