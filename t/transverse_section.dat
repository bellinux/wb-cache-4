5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A <b>transverse</b> <b>section</b> through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings There may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E

2500|$|A chined hull {{consists}} of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set {{at an angle}} to each other when viewed in <b>transverse</b> <b>section.</b> The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often bent lengthwise. Plywood chined boats made of 8'x4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3–6mm can easily be shaped into a compound bend. Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun [...] "pirogue" [...] {{is an example of a}} craft with hard chines. Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at planing. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.|$|E

60|$|Well, {{that is a}} {{very curious}} thing! The fact is that the Dog and the Horse--when one gets a look at them without the outward impediments of the skin--are found to be made in very much the same sort of fashion. And if I were to make a <b>transverse</b> <b>section</b> of the Dog, I should find the same organs that I have already shown you as forming parts of the Horse. Well, here is another skeleton--that of a kind of Lemur--you see he has just the same bones; and if I were to make a <b>transverse</b> <b>section</b> of it, it would be just the same again. In your mind's eye turn him round, so as to put his {{backbone}} in a position inclined obliquely upwards and forwards, just as in the next three diagrams, which represent the skeletons of an Orang, a Chimpanzee, a Gorilla, and you find you have no trouble in identifying the bones throughout; and lastly turn {{to the end of the}} series, the diagram representing a man's skeleton, and still you find no great structural feature essentially altered. There are the same bones in the same relations. From the Horse we pass on and on, with gradual steps, until we arrive at last at the highest known forms. On the other hand, take the other line of diagrams, and pass from the Horse downwards in the scale to this fish; and still, though the modifications are vastly greater, the essential framework of the organization remains unchanged. Here, for instance, is a Porpoise: here is its strong backbone, with the cavity running through it, which contains the spinal cord; here are the ribs, here the shoulder blade; here is the little short upper-arm bone, here are the two forearm bones, the wrist-bone, and the finger-bones.|$|E
60|$|Strange, is it not, {{that the}} Porpoise should {{have in this}} queer-looking affair--its flapper (as it is called), the same {{fundamental}} elements as the fore-leg of the Horse or the Dog, or the Ape or Man; and here you will notice a very curious thing,--the hinder limbs are absent. Now, let us make another jump. Let us go to the Codfish: here you see is the forearm, in this large pectoral fin--carrying your mind's eye onward from the flapper of the Porpoise. And here you have the hinder limbs restored {{in the shape of}} these ventral fins. If I were to make a <b>transverse</b> <b>section</b> of this, I should find just the same organs that we have before noticed. So that, you see, there comes out this strange conclusion as the result of our investigations, that the Horse, when examined and compared with other animals, is found by no means to stand alone in nature; but that there are an enormous number of other creatures which have backbones, ribs, and legs, and other parts arranged in the same general manner, and in all their formation exhibiting the same broad peculiarities.|$|E
6000|$|... § XVII. When {{the main}} {{contours}} of the base are once determined, its decoration {{is as easy as}} it is infinite. I have merely given, in Plate XII., three examples to which I shall need to refer, hereafter. No. 9 is a very early and curious one; the decoration of the base 6 in Plate XI., representing a leaf turned over and flattened down; or, rather, the idea of the turned leaf, worked as well as could be imagined on the flat contour of the spur. Then 10 is the perfect, but simplest possible development of the same idea, from the earliest bases of the upper colonnade of the Ducal Palace, that is to say, the bases of the sea façade; and 7 and 8 are its lateral profile and <b>transverse</b> <b>section.</b> Finally, 11 and 12 are two of the spurs of the later shafts of the same colonnade on the Piazzetta side (No. 12 of Plate XI.). No. 11 occurs on one of these shafts only, and is singularly beautiful. I suspect it to be earlier than the other, which is the characteristic base {{of the rest of the}} series, and already shows the loose, sensual, ungoverned character of fifteenth century ornament in the dissoluteness of its rolling.|$|E

60|$|Section 7. The {{method of}} {{examining}} cross-sections {{is an extremely}} convenient one {{in the study of}} such a type as Amphioxus. The student should very carefully go over and copy the six sections on Sheet 20, comparing Figure 1 as he goes. He should do this before reading what follows. One little matter must be borne in mind. These figures are merely intended to convey the great structural ideas, and they are considerably simplified; they must not be regarded as a substitute for the examination of microscopic sections. [He will notice a number of rounded masses from the body wall. The] -For instance, the body-wall- muscles of Amphioxus are arranged in bundles bent sharply in an arrow shape, the point forward. -A number of these bundles are cut in any one section, and so the even shading of our diagrams, if they professed to be anything more than diagrams, should be broken up into masses.- These -bundles, we may mention-, are called myomeres, and they are indicated in Figure 1 by lines pointing acutely forward. [Several are consequently cut in any <b>transverse</b> <b>section</b> (Sheet 20), and these are the rounded masses he sees.] Similar myomeres, similarly situated, are found in fish, behind the head, and, less obviously, they occur with diminishing importance as the scale of the vertebrata is ascended.|$|E
60|$|In that {{skeleton}} {{there are}} a number of parts to be recognised. The long series of bones, beginning from the skull and ending in the tail, is called the spine, and those in front are the ribs; and then there are two pairs of limbs, one before and one behind; and there are what we all know as the fore-legs and the hind-legs. If we pursue our researches into the interior of this animal, we find within the framework of the skeleton a great cavity, or rather, I should say, two great cavities,--one cavity beginning in the skull and running through the neck-bones, along the spine, and ending in the tail, containing the brain and the spinal marrow, which are extremely important organs. The second great cavity, commencing with the mouth, contains the gullet, the stomach, the long intestine, and all the rest of those internal apparatus which are essential for digestion; and then in the same great cavity, there are lodged the heart and all the great vessels going from it; and, besides that, the organs of respiration--the lungs: and then the kidneys, and the organs of reproduction, and so on. Let us now endeavour to reduce this notion of a horse that we now have, to some such kind of simple expressions as can be at once, and without difficulty, retained in the mind, apart from all minor details. If I make a <b>transverse</b> <b>section,</b> that is, if I were to saw a dead horse across, I should find that, if I left out the details, and supposing I took my section through the anterior region, and through the fore-limbs, I should have here this kind of section of the body (Fig. 1).|$|E
60|$|Section 68. We {{now come}} to Bone, a tissue {{confined}} to the vertebrata, and typically shown only in the higher types. As we descend in the scale from birds and mammals to lizards, amphibia (frogs and toads) and fish, we find cartilage continually more important, and the bony constituent of the skeleton correspondingly less so. In such a type as the dog-fish, the skeleton is entirely cartilaginous, bone only occurs {{in connection with the}} animal's scales; it must have been in connection with scales that bone first appeared in the vertebrate sub-kingdom. In the frog we have a cartilaginous skeleton overlaid by numerous bony scutes (shield-like plates) which, when the student comes to study that type, he will perceive are equivalent to the bony parts of such scales as occur in the dog-fish, sunk inward, and plating over the cartilage; and in the frog the cartilage also is itself, in a few places, replaced by bony tissue. In the adult rabbit these two kinds of bone, the bone overlying what was originally cartilage (membrane bone), and the bone replacing the cartilage (cartilage bone) have, between them, practically superseded the cartilage altogether. The structure of the most characteristic kind of bone will be understood by reference to Figure XVI. It is a simplified diagram of the <b>transverse</b> <b>section</b> of such a bone as the thigh bone. M.C. is the central marrow cavity, H.v., H.v. are cross sections of small bloodvessels, the Haversian vessels running more or less longitudinally through, the bone in canals, the Haversian canals. Arranged round these vessels are circles of the formative elements, the bone corpuscles or osteoblasts (b.c.) each embedded in bony matrix in a little bed, the lacuna, and communicating one with another by fine processes through canaliculi in the matrix, which processes are only to be seen clearly in decalcified bone (See Section 70). The osteoblasts are arranged in concentric series, and the matrix is therefore in concentric layers, or lamellae (c.l.). Without and within the zone of Haversian systems are (o.l. and i.l.), the outer and inner lamellae. The bone is surrounded by connective tissue, the periosteum. In addition to this compact bone, there is a lighter and looser variety in which spicules and bars of bony tissue are loosely interwoven. Many flat bones, the bones of the skull, for instance, consist of this spongy bone, plated (as an electro spoon is plated) with compact bone.|$|E

60|$|But this I {{cannot be}} {{positive}} in, for upon cutting the wreath'd part {{in many places}} transversly, I was not so well satisfy'd with the shape and manner of the pores of the pith; for looking on these <b>transverse</b> <b>Sections</b> with a very good Microscope, I found that the ends of those <b>transverse</b> <b>Sections</b> appear'd much of {{the manner of the}} third Figure of the 15. scheme ABCFE, and the middle of pith CC, seem'd very full of pores indeed, but all of them seem'd to run the long-ways.|$|R
40|$|In several {{research}} areas, <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> are {{indispensable for}} studying structural aspects of specimens. However, the oriented embedding of small cylindrical samples can become problematic, especially when <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> {{at right angles}} to the main axis of the object are desired. Here, we describe an easy and low-cost technique for oriented embedding of small (500 mum). The usefulness of the technique is demonstrated for roots and stamens of Arabidopsis thaliana and for adventitious roots of Asplenium demerkense, as examples of small and larger cylindrical samples, respectively. Furthermore, several types of resin (glycol methacrylate, epoxy and acrylic resins) were successfully tested, showing the applicability of the technique for light and electron microscopy and for immunolocalizations. In conclusion, the principle of the technique can be extended to several resins and a wide variety of specimen types, such as stems, leaves and textile fibres.
