He told Moore to include three separate love stories in the film, [...] "one between two Americans, one between two Koreans, and one between an American and a Korean". Moore explained that [...] "the love stories were supposed {{to tell the story}} of the tragedy of Korea, the tragedy of the Korean War". Ishii stated to Moore that he did not wish for the movie to turn into an [...] "anti-Communist tract". Prior to the completion of the film's screenplay, the film's producers encountered difficulties obtaining an affiliation with a movie studio. Ishii said that North Korea placed pressure on Toho Studios through labor unions in Japan, requesting that the studio pull out of its affiliation with Inchon. The labor unions criticized the film's production, saying that it was influenced by Moon and his Unification Church, in addition to the Korean CIA and was part of an effort <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of South Korea. Because of this criticism, Toho Studios canceled its participation in the Inchon project.|$|E

Snowden described his CIA experience in Geneva as formative, stating that the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home. Snowden said that when the latter was arrested, a CIA operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant. Ueli Maurer, President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013, in June of that year publicly disputed Snowden's claims. [...] "This would mean that the CIA successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary. With all due respect, I just can't imagine it," [...] said Maurer.

60|$|Gomez {{started when}} {{he was given the}} note, for Evelyn had made an {{unexpected}} move; but he saw the importance of what it implied and lighted a cigarette while he thought the matter out. He had suspected the Enchantress for some time and knew that Grahame was her owner. Since the yanqui was in communication with a dangerous revolutionist, he must be engaged in smuggling arms, and if he had landed many, the rebels would be ready to fight. For all that, Gomez was puzzled. Grahame was a friend of the señorita Cliffe's--perhaps even her lover--and he was helping the rebels, while her father had {{spent a good deal of}} money <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> This suggested that Cliffe might be playing a crooked game, and bore out some suspicions Gomez had entertained. The President must be informed at once; but in the meantime Gomez saw how the note could be made use of.|$|E
