25|$|Kurlantzick and Link {{noted that}} through {{cultivating}} {{economic growth and}} Chinese nationalism, the CCP has modernized authoritarianism to maintain their political control. They asserted that elite business leaders, who have benefited from China's economic growth, have accepted the CCP's authoritarian control as a result, largely preventing the new rich and emerging middle class from challenging their rule. Fenby argues that the latter, rather than accepting the system per se, have learnt {{to use it to}} their advantage. Kurlantzick and Link also noted that dissent still largely exists in the Chinese populace in regards to government policies on the economy, environment and society, particularly in rural areas, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more aware of their constitutional rights. A recent poll in 2007 showed that 70% of Chinese consider the new rich to be corrupt and unworthy of respect.|$|E
25|$|Transport: Primary {{transportation}} on {{the island}} is by privately owned used car or car-rental for visitors. The Waiheke Bus Company (owned by Fullers) services most inhabited parts of the island, linking to the ferry sailings from Matiatia. Numerous other taxi, shuttle, bus and boutique services cater to visitors. Due to the hills, bicycles {{on the island}} tended {{to be limited to}} the young and fit, including an active mountain bike group, until the advent of ebikes. With an ebike rental company in Oneroa that also sells ebikes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> a common feature on both local roads, and on the ferry boats to the mainland. Walking continues to be a popular means of island transport, both for access and recreation with many walking trails that are not along roads. Horse riding tends to be for recreation rather than transport, but the island does support both a pony club and adult riding club.|$|E

By the late 1970s, women became very prominent in the artistic world. An increase in individualism was more apparent as Chicano artists entered the art business market.|$|R
25|$|As for the ultra-orthodox Cubists such as M. Gleizes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> very tiresome. Someone {{who knows}} M.

It may be my stupidity, but I cannot understand what {{this sort of thing}} means or what the artist is driving at. There are a few other paintings which may, presumably, be called Cubist in default of any better name, which are merely patterns in bright colours, such as M. Picabia's and M. Metzinger's. One of M. Metzinger's pictures is a puzzle made up of a leg, an arm, a hat, a parasol, and various other objects, and is called En Canot. These patterns have certain decorative qualities and might do for a carpet or a hanging, but they are absurd in frames, and it is a mere affectation to give them titles.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 Lincoln, England {{established}} an annual Christmas market in early December, and this {{remains one of}} the most extensive such market by area in the United Kingdom, with a claimed total of over 300 stalls attracting more than 100,000 visitors over its four days. Starting in 1997 Frankfurt Christmas Markets were established with support from Frankfurt in the British Cities of Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds and Manchester. Other large Christmas markets have been held in England in Bath (since 2000) or Liverpool (since 2006). The Christmas markets are such a success that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> a major pull factor to increase trade and visitor numbers to towns and cities. Manchester's Christmas Markets have been particularly successful with 300 stalls over 8 city locations with each location being themed to create a different atmosphere such as French, World and German, with European themed stalls on the Albert Square, Manchester proving to be the most popular.|$|E

2500|$|On the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{there is}} a variety of {{different}} lock gear. Some paddles are raised by turning what is in effect a large horizontal wing nut (butterfly nut) lifting a screw-threaded bar attached {{to the top of the}} paddle. Others are operated by lifting a long wooden lever, which operates a wooden plate which seals the culvert. These are known locally as [...] "jack cloughs". Bottom gate paddles are sometimes operated by a horizontal ratchet which also slides a wooden plate sideways, rather than the more common vertical lift.

2500|$|Adopted {{children}} also often {{find it hard}} to form comfortable and meaningful relationships. These relationships can be friendly, familial or romantic. Because many adoptees feel that their biological parents left them, they may be afraid to form new relationships in fear that those involved may [...] "leave" [...] them as well. This can lead to holding back and withdrawing from relationships when they feel like <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> too attached as well as not forming relationships at all. The fear of being left or forgotten is what often holds adoptees back from creating such relationships. Many adoptees feel that they can never truly relate to or trust anybody because their family experiences can be so vastly different from those of people who have not been adopted. It is because of such fears that so many adoptees {{find it hard to}} create relationships in their lives.|$|E

2500|$|Gender {{differences}} {{related to}} body image are increasingly prevalent {{between men and}} women. Throughout all stages of life, women have more body dissatisfaction than men. Although dissatisfaction {{is more common in}} women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women. In a longitudinal study that assessed body image across time and age between men and women, men placed greater significance on their physical appearance than women, even though women report body image dissatisfaction more often. [...] Adolescence is where this difference is most notable. One reason for this is because males are being targeted in the media more heavily today. Historically, and for a much longer period of time, the media has immoderately targeted females, which may explain why <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> less sensitized to the effects. This information suggests that appearance pressure and concerns are continuing to affect both men and women in western culture.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} festival {{of the year is}} commonly known as the Swing Festival. The four-day Akha Swing Festival comes in late-August each year and falls on the 120th day after the village has planted its rice. The Akha call the Swing Festival, Yehkuja, which translates as [...] "eating bitter rice", a phrase which references the previous year's dwindling rice supply incorporates the hope that monsoons will soon water the new crop. Festival activities include ritual offerings to family ancestral spirits at the ancestral altar {{in a corner of the}} women's side of the house. Offerings consist of bits of cooked food, water, and rice whiskey. The swing festival is particularly important for Akha women, who will display the clothing they spent all year making and who will show, through ornamentation, that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> older and of marriageable age. Because the women dress up in their best traditional clothing and ornaments and perform traditional dances and songs for the villagers, the Swing Festival is also known as Women's New Year. The traditional New Year which falls in late-December is known as Men's New Year.|$|E
2500|$|Communication within {{peer groups}} allows {{adolescents}} {{to explore their}} feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members {{the opportunity to develop}} social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>becoming.</b> Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent's own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are more likely to both continue to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents.|$|E
