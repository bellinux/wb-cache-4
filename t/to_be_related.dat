5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E

In this group, impulsivity did not relate to any eating behaviors, while venturesomess seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negatively <b>related</b> with ineffectiveness, interpersonal distrust and asceticism.

5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes {{increase the risk}} of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers.

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wrens. Initially fairywrens {{were thought to be}} a member of the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975.

5|$|Mindomys hammondi, {{also known}} as Hammond's rice rat or Hammond's oryzomys, is a species of rodent in the tribe Oryzomyini of family Cricetidae. Formerly {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> with Nectomys, Sigmodontomys, Megalomys, or Oryzomys, it is now placed in its own genus, Mindomys, but its relationships remain obscure; some evidence supports a placement near Oecomys or as a basal member of Oryzomyini.|$|E

One is endemic and two more are endemic subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E

In such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH levels are measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted.|$|E

5|$|About 90% of the sungrazers {{observed}} with SOHO {{are members of}} the Kreutz group, which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first passage through the inner Solar System.

5|$|According to a 1997 U.S. Census Bureau report {{less than}} 10% of {{severely}} disabled individuals were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. Factors {{that have been}} found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to employment are a strong work ethic and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others. Employers of AAC users report that skills in time management, problem solving, communication, technology and a good education are important to employers.|$|E

More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves.
