Were I a despot, I should perhaps satiate my vengeance upon this female fiend with the {{assistance}} of the rack, but that cannot be; and, after all, it would be but a poor revenge in one who has worshipped the Empire of the Intellect to vindicate the agony I am now enduring upon <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>body</b> of a woman. No! 'tis not all over. There is yet an intellectual rack of which few dream: far, far more terrific than the most exquisite contrivances of Parysatis.

And yet, would not {{that increase the}} horror, the agony, the evil of it-to her, at least, most real evil, not to be explained away-and yet the gods required it? Were they just, merciful in that? Was it like them, to torture her, their last unshaken votary? Did they require it? Was it not required of them by some higher power, of whom they were only the emanations, the tools, the puppets?--and required of that higher power by some still higher one--some nameless, absolute destiny of which Orestes and she, and all heaven and earth, were but the victims, dragged along in an inevitable vortex, helpless, hopeless, toward that for which each was meant?--And she was meant for this! The thought was unbearable; it turned her giddy. No! she would not! She would rebel! Like Prometheus, she would dare destiny, and brave its worst! And she sprang up to recall the letter.... Miriam was gone; and she threw herself on the floor, and wept bitterly.|$|E

5000|$|A {{coating of}} white or {{coloured}} slip (sometimes {{called by the}} French term engobe in American English) {{can be applied to}} the whole body of the article, or just one part, such as outside or inside of a cup or jug, to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect. Slip can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours. Sgraffito (or [...] "sgraffiato") involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>body</b> underneath. Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state. One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration. This is particularly useful if <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>body</b> is not of the desired colour or texture.|$|E

The structured anode plates are made of self-passivation metal equipped with an active layer and bind in plastic anode frames, which are equipped with flow channels for transporting the anolyte medium to and/or from the anode plates. The pressing mechanism is formed from pneumatic or hydraulic inflatable thrust bolts that press the anode plate against the solid electrolyte membrane by movably arranged thrust plate. The anode frame and anode plate are separated through isolating, flexible plastic foils from <b>the</b> electrode <b>base</b> plate with <b>the</b> pressing mechanism. The contacting of the anode plate is carried out by contact foils that are connected to the isolated plastic foil or beneath the anode frame with <b>the</b> electrode <b>base</b> plate. <b>The</b> anode plate consists of expanded metals or sheet metals in which slits are incorporated in flow direction. The anode plates are equipped with longitudinal- or transversal shaft in which fine openings are incorporated in the flow direction and shaft upper side adjacent to the electrolyte membrane. The active layer of the anode plate consists of doped diamond, noble metal or noble metal containing oxide. The anode plates are formed out of partial sections flow throughable one after other in flow direction. The solid electrolyte membrane is cation exchange membrane with a perflourinated synthetic resin matrix. A gas diffusion layer is arranged between the cathode channel and the electrolyte membrane, compresses by the pressing mechanism on the path between the cathode channel and on the solid electrolyte membrane and is contacted with the cathode channel and the electrolyte membrane.
