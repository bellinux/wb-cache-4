5000|$|SZD-19-2 Zefir 2B - Designation {{change after}} {{modification}} {{to allow the}} pilot to control/adjust the braking force of the <b>tail</b> <b>chute</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Single-seat ground-attack fighter {{version for}} the RAF; all were {{modified}} from F.6 airframes. Strengthened wing, 230 gallon inboard drop tanks, <b>tail</b> <b>chute,</b> increased oxygen capacity, and bobweight in pitch control circuit to increase stick force in ground attack manoeuvres, 128 conversions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its larger span, the SHK's V-tail surfaces were 50% larger than the Austria {{and there were other}} improvements. The tailplane was [...] "all-moving", mass-balanced, and had aerodynamic trim tabs. An SHK flown by Rolf Kuntz finished in 3rd place in the Open Class of the 1965 World Gliding Championships at South Cerney in England. In 1967 a model with improved comfort for the pilot was introduced and a <b>tail</b> <b>chute</b> was provided. The SHK was probably the last mainly wooden Open Class glider to be developed before glass fiber aircraft became available.|$|E
50|$|The KH-1 is a shoulder-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with {{a conventional}} all-wood semi-monocoque fuselage and tail unit with an all-moving tailplane, the wings have small-span flaps for control during approach but no airbrakes or spoilers. The pilot has a semi-reclined seat in an enclosed cockpit under a two-piece transparent canopy. The KH-1 landing gear is a retractable monowheel gear and a tailskid, {{it is also}} fitted with a <b>tail</b> drag <b>chute</b> to control speed during approach.|$|R
50|$|The SZD-19 {{was totally}} re-designed with all-wooden wings, revised {{fuselage}} and tail section, and towing hook relocated to the retractable undercarriage chassis, {{designated as the}} SZD-19-2 Zefir 2, first flying on 11 March 1960, showing a marked improvement over the Zefir. Two prototypes of the Zefir 2 were built, flying in the 1960 World Championships at KÃ¶ln in Germany to gain second, piloted by Edward Makula, and third, piloted by Jerzy Popiel, places in the Open class.With significant success in the World Championships, the SZD-19-2 was refined with new stabilisers and landing gear to become the SZD-19-2 Zefir 2A, flying {{for the first time}} in 1962, in time for the 1963 World Championships, held in Argentina, where Makula and Popiel took first and second places. As a result of these successes, demand for the SZD-19-2 was significant with 14 units built, most being sold to other countries, (according to some sources, 20 SZD-19-2A units were constructed.). From the beginning until (and including) Zefir 3 these gliders did not have spoilers (airbrakes) - a <b>tail</b> <b>chute</b> was used. The chute drag could be controlled by the pilot (in versions 2B and 3).Several records were established by the Zefir 2A/B's, including; a flight distance of 714 km and a 100 km closed triangle speed record of 102 km/h (63.4 mph).|$|E
