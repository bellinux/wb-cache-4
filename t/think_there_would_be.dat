500|$|In 1998, Laurie Brown of the CBC {{criticized the}} Walk of Fame, calling it [...] "just an {{attraction}} to lure tourists to theatres in the area." [...] She claimed {{that it would}} only honour Canadians with international impact, saying [...] "if it was truly for Canadians, then I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more of a national bend to the whole thing. But I doubt I'm {{going to see a}} star on the Walk of Fame that is only a known-name here in Canada." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 2010, he {{has said}} he would allow for a doctor's {{discretion}} in life-threatening cases such as ectopic pregnancies. Concerning same-sex marriage, Paul has made a distinction between his personal beliefs and how he feels the government should handle it. He has stated that he personally feels same-sex marriage [...] "offends [...] and a lot of people", and said there is a [...] "crisis that allows people to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> some other sorts of marriage." [...] However, he believes the issue should be left to the states to decide, and would not support a federal ban.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé's {{debut album}} was {{released}} on 13 February 2012. She {{said that it is}} very hard to imagine that she is releasing an album with Virgin Records. She said that she was always going to [...] "definitely" [...] release an album, if she was signed or not. However, she stated that she did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "this much anticipation, or acknowledgement of what I was doing". She said she loves to be in the limelight and that people are talking about her so much. She said she only loves the attention because she has experienced the other side, when no one cares.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a {{very good}} story, Terence, and I <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no great fear, {{even if we were}} to go boldly into a town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should hardly <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a tumult here, Gregory. The natives {{all seem}} very gentle and peaceable, {{and the army}} is {{composed}} of {{the same sort of}} men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{quantity}} of them!" [...] said Rollo. [...] "I should <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> knife handles enough in the pile for all creation. Where can they get so many horns?" ...|$|R
2500|$|I think I {{agree with}} your [...] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure {{it would be the}} last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.|$|E
2500|$|Connecticut's George P. McLean on January 25 with an {{amendment}} reducing the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 250,000 and a recommendation that it pass. The presiding officer over the Senate, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall {{asked if there}} was objection to its passage. [...] The Minority Leader, Democrat Oscar Underwood of Alabama said he did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> objection, but that the bill should be read first. [...] Idaho Senator William E. Borah, a Republican, stated he would object to the bill if there was to be discussion of it, as the Senate had not had morning business in ten days. Borah asked McLean if he expected there would be objection to the bill, and McLean reassured the Idahoan. The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded objection.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after these}} charges were filed, there were calls from gay rights advocates and bloggers to include hate crimes charges against Ravi and Wei. Bruce Kaplan, the {{prosecutor}} in the case, said [...] "now that two individuals {{have been charged with}} invasion of privacy, we will be making every effort to assess whether bias {{played a role in the}} incident, and, if so, we will bring appropriate charges." [...] On October 4, 2010, Kaplan stated that he did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> enough evidence to charge Ravi and Wei with a hate crime. After further investigation, the prosecution concluded that there was evidence supporting a hate crime charge against Ravi, dating to when Ravi first learned Clementi's name. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts, including bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, witness tampering, and evidence tampering.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} could live here," [...] said Mrs. Vincent {{as though she were}} making a great admission. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any law to turn him out of the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, colonel; {{but you know}} you promised {{to give us a}} chance if you could, and having a chance of course means having extra danger; but I really don't <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any great danger in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he had not, Lady, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> {{none of us}} left to trick, {{seeing that}} the people were crazed with the dread of the {{darkness}} and believed {{that it could be}} lifted by you alone, as indeed happened," [...] I added somewhat doubtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose I {{went from}} room to room, and searched everything, and peeped in everywhere? Do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any chance--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. Still, you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{no harm in}} {{my writing}} to Marian to say that her {{behavior}} has attracted your notice, and----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Oliver; [...] "it {{looks like}} a dog's track; but I shouldn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a dog {{out here in the}} woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{could have}} got a home for her somewhere," [...] Vincent said quietly. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> any {{difficulty}} about that. Still I am glad I didn't have to do so, and one slave more or less can make no difference here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, Monsieur," [...] he said, [...] "if {{that lady}} had been King of France, do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> any States General, any red bonnets, any Jacobins or Cordeliers? Parbleu, {{she would have}} swept the vicemongers and traitors out of the Palais Royal itself. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> a house-cleaning there. I, who speak to you, know it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{am not so}} sure of that. She {{will not}} want more than her fair interest; and as it will be {{thoroughly}} well managed, I should <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> something over--something enough {{to keep up the}} house. And then, you know, we must have some place in the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any use in it, {{and choose}} to take the trouble of lugging me about the country, I don't see why you should not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} so," [...] the Inspector {{answered}} warily. [...] "By the bye, do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{any chance}} of five minutes' interview with your chief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{much use}} in trying. You couldn't carry me {{for more than}} four or five minutes. That wouldn't be worth while, would it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Since 5, 7, and 11 are {{consecutive}} primes, {{one might}} <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> such a congruence {{for the next}} prime 13, [...] for some a. This is, however, false. In fact, it can be shown {{that there is no}} congruence of the form [...] for any prime b other than 5, 7, or 11.|$|R
6000|$|... "And to {{hear their}} damnable taunts!" [...] said Edith. [...] "It is very hard upon him. I think it is papa's idea to keep him here till after the trial in August, and then, if possible, {{to send him to}} England. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the double journey else, and papa <b>thinks</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no real danger till his {{evidence}} had been given." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I should <b>think,</b> father, that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> time {{to fetch}} Major Drummond's servant and horse. It {{is not so}} very far, and surely it might {{be done in a}} week.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{they would}} have done better, a year or two since, when we were {{settling}} a new tariff; but I should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> less demand for them now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You think so?' said Amy. 'Well, Guy {{would be}} glad. Yes. O Laura, if Philip {{would learn to}} do Guy justice, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any more to wish!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you not?" [...] {{the other}} {{asked with a}} hint of polite surprise. [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> much {{difficulty}} about a new commission, and officers are wanted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and I thought scarlet most {{becoming}} to our complexion, Joe Blake!" [...] says Sir George. [...] "And my wife <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> {{not have}} <b>been</b> {{room for two}} such great men on one side." ...|$|R
60|$|The term at Putnam Hall Military Academy {{was at an}} end, and {{the school}} days of the three Rover boys at that {{institution}} were now {{a thing of the}} past. Each had graduated with honors, yet all were a trifle sad to <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no going back to a place where they had made so many friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mrs. Docimer, I {{have taken}} my place. Your sister seemed to <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> great danger if I waited till to-morrow morning when I {{could have got}} a {{pleasant}} lift in a return carriage. I hate travelling at night and I hate diligences. I was quite prepared to post all the way, though it would have ruined me,--only for this accursed diligence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if I cannot {{find that}} out, monsieur; {{if there is}} no {{arrangement}} made at all--though I should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> for the butchers will like to have everything done in order--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A fine {{time for}} sport, Dickey; don't you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more {{room in the}} broad street than on this crowded lawn, where you lose your ball so often in the shrubbery?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any shooting," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "But now you've brought it, I {{might as}} well take the pistol along," [...] and he placed the weapon in his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Mr. Mainwaring, I may <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no Goarlys {{if there}} were no Ruffords. That, however, is a great {{question}} which cannot be argued on this case. All we can hope here is that one poor man may have an act of justice done him though in seeking for it he has to struggle against so wealthy a magnate as Lord Rufford." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{can never}} marry now, you know. Only <b>think</b> of it. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> three hundred a year between them.--Not at present, that is," [...] added Aunt Letty, {{looking forward to}} a future period after her own death.|$|R
5000|$|In Voices to Visions magazine, Mark Edward {{states that}} [...] "common sense should {{tell us what}} these charlatans (psychics) do is an act and nothing more; otherwise, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ruling the planet." [...] Concerning the ghost hunting shows, Edward <b>thinks</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more {{interest}} in finding out what is really making noises in these homes but first they need to [...] "turn the f****ing lights on...and (stop) promulgating obvious storytelling." ...|$|R
