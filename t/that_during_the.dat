30|$|The {{incipient}} droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> wintering {{period of}} the winter wheat growth helped to increase the winter wheat yield, while the mild droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in a reduction of yield. The mild droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> filling and maturity period {{had a significant effect}} on the yield of winter wheat. The moderate droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> flowering, filling, and maturity periods of the winter wheat growth {{had a significant impact on}} yield. In addition, the water shortage due to droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> seeding period in autumn also affected the production of winter wheat, and that is particularly true for the severe and extreme droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> seeding period. With some exception of the occurrence of droughts of certain intensities during some specific growth stages of winter wheat, droughts of higher intensities had greater impacts on winter wheat yield <b>during</b> <b>the</b> critical growth stages.|$|R

Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported <b>that</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated <b>that,</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California.

5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said <b>that,</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night {{which in turn}} extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down {{the chance to work}} on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E

Both texts recorded <b>that</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Warring States period (403–221 BC) {{the people of}} Linzi city, capital of the State of Qi, enjoyed playing cuju along with partaking in many other pastimes such as cockfighting.

5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted <b>that</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> latter {{stages of the}} game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style {{made it difficult to}} understand what was happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E

To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E
