5|$|According to Glajar, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of the narrator's mother, {{who writes}} of her sicknesses in her {{letters in the}} hope of keeping her {{daughter}} emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father {{was a member of the}} SS (as were Müller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timişoara, where the main characters attend college—between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, {{it would be hard to}} maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E

The two became friends and quickly discovered their shared interest in punk. MacKaye and Nelson saw their first punk show in January 1979—a benefit concert by the Cramps for WGTB. The concert inspired the pair; MacKaye later admitted, [...] "It blew my mind because I saw {{for the first time}} this huge, totally invisible community that had gathered together for this tribal event.

500|$|The Get Up Kids {{were viewed}} {{throughout}} their existence as a prototypical emo band, having been {{major players in}} the Midwest emo movement of the mid-1990s. Their second album Something to Write Home About remains their most widely acclaimed album, and is considered {{to be one of the}} quintessential albums of the second-wave emo movement. However, like many early emo bands, The Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves with the term, as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an [...] "emo band." [...] The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album On a Wire, which saw the band take on a much more layered, alternative rock sound. Years later, guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third-wave emo bands, commenting that [...] "he punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different.

2500|$|A {{variety of}} edited Garfield strips {{have been made}} {{available}} on the Internet, some hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site called the [...] "Garfield Randomizer" [...] created a three-panel strip using panels from previous Garfield strips. Another approach, known as [...] "Silent Garfield", involves removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips. Some examples date from 2006. A webcomic called Arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style. [...] The Arbuckle website creator writes: [...] "'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as he sees it. This is his story". Another variation along the same lines, called [...] "Realfield" [...] or [...] "Realistic Garfield", is to redraw Garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons. Still another approach to editing the strips involves removing Garfield and other main characters from the originals completely, leaving Jon talking to himself. While strips in this vein can be found online as early as 2006, the 2008 site Garfield Minus Garfield by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon's [...] "loneliness and desperation" [...] and found his [...] "crazy antics" [...] humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh's strips an [...] "inspired thing to do" [...] and said that [...] "some of [...] work better [...] ". Ballantine Books, which publishes the Garfield books, released a volume of Garfield Minus Garfield strips on October 28, 2008. The volume retains Davis as author and features a foreword by Walsh.|$|E
