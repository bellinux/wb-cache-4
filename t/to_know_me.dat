500|$|Aside from music, {{association}} football {{played a}} major role throughout his life. As well as playing the game, in parking lots, fields, and even inside recording studios, growing up he followed the Brazilian club Santos and its star player Pelé. Marley surrounded himself with people from the sport, and in the 1970s made the Jamaican international footballer Allan [...] "Skill" [...] Cole his tour manager. He told a journalist, [...] "If you want to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me,</b> you will have to play football against me and the Wailers." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{later years}} I {{learned that he}} had always liked me and thought I was worth educating, {{and for that reason}} he made an effort on this trip to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me.</b> He did it cleverly. He knew that I was bewildered by some of the things {{expected}} of me as a candidate's wife ... Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ... I did receive an intensive education on this trip, and Louis Howe played a great part in this education from that time on.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{mainstream}} success {{upon his}} move to America, Dale remained primarily {{known for his}} role as Jim Robinson in Neighbours in the United Kingdom and Australia for several years. This was spoofed in a promotional ident for the UK's Channel 4 in 2007 which sees Dale taking part in a mock interview about the sudden upturn in his career, before being accosted by an Australian fan, who recognises him as Jim Robinson. Discussing this association after Ugly Bettys 2007 Golden Globe win, Dale noted: [...] "Every article I read I'm always, 'Ex-soap star Jim Robinson'. Maybe now people will just get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me</b> as actor Alan Dale." [...] In 2007, Amazon.co.uk reported that they had sold more DVDs of films and television shows featuring Dale than any featuring other ex-Neighbours cast members.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{world in}} which you live," [...] he remarked, [...] "is a {{training}} school, I suppose, for false sentiment. The slight kinship that there is between us is of no account to me. I simply remind you once more that it is to your advantage <b>to</b> neither <b>know</b> <b>me</b> or <b>to</b> <b>know</b> of <b>me.</b> Remember that, {{and it may be}} London or Paris or New York--wherever you choose." ...|$|R

500|$|It {{is likely}} that Murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude. She {{believed}} she did not fit well with the general atmosphere of the court, writing of herself: [...] "I am {{wrapped up in the}} study of ancient stories... living all the time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people.... But when they get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me,</b> they find to their extreme surprise that I am kind and gentle". Inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court, and Mulhern thinks Murasaki's court life was comparatively quiet compared to other court poets. Mulhern speculates that her remarks about Izumi were not so much directed at Izumi's poetry but at her behavior, lack of morality and her court liaisons, of which Murasaki disapproved.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me</b> tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, {{playing at}} the Roseland Ballroom was always a dream of hers. She {{explained}} to John Seabrook of The New Yorker that [...] "It's basically the only room in the city I haven't played." [...] As a young girl, she could not afford tickets, but she did manage to win free tickets to a Franz Ferdinand show during her {{senior year of high}} school. Gaga recalled that she fell down during the show and got her nose broken, making her parents forbid her from visiting Roseland. After the singer's career took off with the release of debut album, The Fame (2008), she bypassed {{playing at the}} venue until its closure. Gaga revealed the official poster for the residency on March 18, 2014. The poster features an image of Gaga that was taken by a stranger in 2008 at the Lower East Side of New York City. According to Gaga: [...] "We found him and used that same photo for my Roseland poster." [...] The poster also includes a quote from Gaga taken when the photograph was taken, that reads: [...] "I'm Lady Gaga. A singer/songwriter. You're going <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me</b> one day." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} I {{could speak to}} her?" [...] It had come into my mind to ask her why she had wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> of <b>me</b> if I should {{recognise}} Mr. Porterfield.|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost," [...] she declared, [...] "you {{have driven}} {{all other things}} out of my mind. What is it that Anna is so anxious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> from <b>me?</b> You are in her confidence, she tells me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Romney's {{campaign}} speeches sometimes {{contained a}} standard {{response to the}} religion issue as a whole: [...] "I believe in God. I believe in the family. I believe in America's future. It has a great role to preserve the peace on the planet. So the kinds of values I have are very much in line {{with those of the}} American people. My guess is as they get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me</b> better, there will be other faults that they find more troubling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Castle {{returns home}} and prepares {{to kill himself}} with his mission fulfilled, but sees a vision {{of his wife and}} changes his mind, instead {{deciding}} to continue to fight crime as the Punisher. He leaves some of Saint's money as a farewell gift to the tenants for protecting him, and leaves to pursue his next target. The movie ends with Castle standing alone in the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, as he vows, [...] "Those who do evil to others...killers, rapists, psychos, sadists...will come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me</b> well. Frank Castle is dead. Call me...the Punisher".|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, the Jacksons {{moved back}} to Greenville, South Carolina. After first opening a {{barbecue}} restaurant, Jackson and his wife opened [...] "Joe Jackson's Liquor Store", which they operated until his death. One of the better known stories of Jackson's post-major league life took place at his liquor store. Ty Cobb and sportswriter Grantland Rice entered the store, with Jackson showing no sign of recognition towards Cobb. After making his purchase, the incredulous Cobb finally asked Jackson, [...] "Don't you know me, Joe?" [...] Jackson replied, [...] "Sure, I know you, Ty, but I wasn't sure you wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me.</b> A lot of them don't." ...|$|E

2500|$|At first, {{it might}} {{appear that the}} boyfriend is {{straight}} up busted. But it's more complicated than that, especially as you see Mýa and her girls engaged in their own energetic calisthenics, then (apparently) commanding their male admirers to hit the ground and perform push-ups, constructing a kind of reciprocal relationship that, for instance, Christina Aguilera's video for [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] cannot do, in its celebration of the most excellent boyfriend {{whose job is to}} be endlessly appreciative of his girlfriend's super-gloriousness (see also, Christina's video for Genie in a Bottle," [...] in which she also dances seductively with a group of girls for a group of boys). Director Diane Martel has done her share of conventionally alluring Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera videos, but here the terms have shifted. Mýa and her girls—in moves recalling Janet's—don't pretend to be charming or enticing. Instead, they present themselves as young women with demands and desires, proudly hard-bodied and self-possessed.Mýa can rock the midriff tops like any other pop star, but as always, she remains slightly offbeat, neither apologetic nor solicitous. Sexy and self-assured without being coy, she knows who she is and what she wants, and says it outright: [...] "What'cha gonna do / When you can't say no / And your feelings start to show? / Boy I really need to know / And how you gonna act?" [...] In Mýa's world, it's not the girl who turns emotional and unsure of herself when a question of integrity arises, but the more fragile, less stable boy. She warns,"There's no need to / Reminisce about the past, / Obviously, 'cause that shit did not last." [...] The video's imagery underlines her admonition, as the camera shoots up at her looking unafraid and austere, backed by her crew as the dust flies from their work-out: [...] "She don't know me / She's about <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>me</b> / I'm in your life / That's how it's gon' be." [...] And if you want to mess around, you're free to choose, but it will cost: [...] "If you want her back / You can take her back. / Cause game recognize game. / I could do the same thing." [...] And she does. At the end of the [...] video, Mýa and her dancers exit, leaving their audience dusty and on their own.|$|E

You ought <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> <b>me</b> better, and Flint ought <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> <b>me</b> better. There ain't a mite of use of our staying here another second, and you can go right back and tell Flint what I said.
