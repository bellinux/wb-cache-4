5|$|Although war pigeons {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, the Soviet army discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Signal Corps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.|$|E
5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Booth and a {{group of}} co-conspirators {{originally}} plotted to kidnap Lincoln but later planned to kill him, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William H. Seward in a bid to help the Confederacy's cause. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered four days earlier, but Booth believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War was not yet over because Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's army was still fighting the Union Army.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not long}} before the {{residents}} of Cabuyao celebrated the independence of the Philippines from the Spanish government when <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> arrived in 1899.

5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project {{that had already been}} penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to <b>the</b> militiamen <b>that</b> <b>the</b> starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> camp understood <b>the</b> message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had gotten <b>the</b> message, and <b>that</b> they had not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|R

5|$|John James Audubon {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> white ibis was hunted {{and sold}} in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste. Elsewhere, the flesh {{has been described as}} appealing on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus Eudocimus have been hunted, which has been responsible for decline, across their range. Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of hunting is not thought to be major.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{understood}} logistics and its {{paramount importance}} in modern warfare, and he spared {{no effort to}} ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> fighting man had all he needed for victory. Near {{the end of the}} war, Somervell was promoted to general on March 9, 1945. He was the very few officers to be promoted to that rank during the war who had not commanded combat forces overseas.|$|E

60|$|It was at Ticonderoga <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had {{prepared}} to make their first stand. The place lies on the western shore of the lake a few miles to the northward of the narrow inlet uniting Lake Champlain to Lake George. It was to reconnoiter <b>the</b> fort <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party now set out. News had been brought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had been executing great additional works, and the British general was anxious to learn {{the nature of these}} before he advanced.|$|R

On 25 February 2005, the seven still living American pilots were awarded the French Legion of Honor by Jean-David Levitte, the French {{ambassador}} to the United States. The role <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> pilots played in this battle had remained little known until 2004. The American historian Erik Kirsinger researched the case {{for more than a}} year to establish the facts.|$|E
5|$|Upon Buckles' {{death on}} February 27, 2011, President Barack Obama ordered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> flag be flown at half-staff on all {{government}} buildings, including the White House and U.S. embassies, {{on the day}} in March when Buckles would be buried at Arlington. Leading up to the March 15 funeral, the governors of 16states likewise called for lowering their states' flags to half-staff.|$|E
5|$|A seminar {{was held}} in 2011 to design the show's {{curriculum}} and educational framework, and was attended by over 80 education and media experts. The seminar, also attended by ABEGS representatives, {{was sponsored by the}} GCC Joint Program Production Institution (GCC-JPPI) and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), a manufacturing company based in Riyadh and one of the private corporations that sponsored the new show. The participants took into consideration the educational changes that had occurred in the region in the previous 20 years, including a more diverse and complicated world and a need for more creativity to educate young children. The seminar focused on the education needs of children throughout the Arab world, the possible effects of the show's return, and how to provide educational resources and technology to children in the 21st century. The seminar participants recommended the creation of an advisory council, consisting of education experts and media professionals, as well as expanding to new media forms other than TV, and including important Arab celebrities as guests on the show, all components <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> show used.|$|E

5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north when he learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> army had closed in on {{the members of the}} British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive {{is due to a}} failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E

5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when many}} publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5000|$|The American-facilitated Bay of Pigs Invasion of April 1961 also rocked Khrushchev and Kennedy’s relationship.

Armed aggression has begun against Cuba.” [...] Kennedy countered by saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> were merely helping support the “100,000 Cubans” attempting to “resist the Castro dictatorship.” [...] He claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> fought on <b>the</b> side of freedom and Cuban self-determination.|$|R
