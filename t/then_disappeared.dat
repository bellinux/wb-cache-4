5|$|Roger le Poer was {{a medieval}} Lord Chancellor from 1135 until 1139 for King Stephen of England. The {{son of a}} {{powerful}} bishop, Roger owed his position to his family connections. He lost his office when his father and other relatives lost power. Arrested along with his father, Roger was used to secure the surrender of a castle held by his mother and <b>then</b> <b>disappeared</b> from history.|$|E
5|$|While {{keeping his}} {{involvement}} with Waters's underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After charging them for a major repair to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated it from {{him and told him}} that they would not continue to financially support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and <b>then</b> <b>disappeared,</b> not seeing or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that he was fine, but on none did he leave a return address. Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris's doctor, who prescribed the southern state's warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris's muscular dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave {{since the war began}} in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered with his family and those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 <b>then</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant that the chances of reaching England were slim. He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E

25|$|The patrol ships took up station one {{either side}} of Gulflight, Iago close on the {{starboard}} side and Filey further ahead on the port. While under escort, Gulflight's second officer, Paul Bowers, reported sighting a submarine ahead some 28 minutes before the ship was hit. He reported this to the captain who decided that the submarine must be British, as the escorts had not reacted to its presence. The submarine was visible for 5 minutes and <b>then</b> <b>disappeared.</b>|$|E

25|$|Batwoman and Bat-Girl {{were created}} to be romantic {{interests}} for Batman and Robin, respectively, as well as wannabe crime-fighting associates. Bat-Girl appeared seven times between 1961 and 1964, but <b>then</b> <b>disappeared</b> in 1964 (along with Batwoman, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite) when new Batman editor, Julius Schwartz, decided she and other characters were too silly. It has been suggested by scholars that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and Bat-Girl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute allegations of homosexuality in Batman comics; specifically, the enduring claim that Batman and Robin were homosexuals.|$|E
25|$|Leslie Gay {{was educated}} at Marlborough, Brighton College and Clare College, Cambridge. An {{intermittent}} cricketer {{who had left}} the first-class game by 1904, Gay kept wicket for Cambridge in the Varsity match against Oxford University in 1892 and 1893, and after four games for Somerset in 1894 he was picked for the 1894-95 tour to Australia under Andrew Stoddart. Chosen only for the first Test match, he scored 33 and four and took three catches with one stumping. He <b>then</b> <b>disappeared</b> from first-class cricket until a brief nine-match return with Hampshire in 1900.|$|E

In early December he was captured by Mobutu's troops and incarcerated at his headquarters in Thysville. However, Mobutu still considered him a threat and on 17 January 1961 transferred him to the rebelling State of Katanga. Lumumba <b>then</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the public view. It was later discovered that he was murdered the same day by the secessionist forces of Moise Tshombe after Mobutu's government turned him over.|$|E

25|$|Cave bears {{found in}} {{different}} regions vary in age, thus facilitating investigations into evolutionary trends. The three anterior premolars were gradually reduced, <b>then</b> <b>disappeared,</b> possibly {{in response to}} a largely vegetarian diet. In a fourth of the skulls found in the Conturines, the third premolar is still present, while more derived specimens elsewhere lack it. The last remaining premolar became conjugated with the true molars, enlarging the crown and granting it more cusps and cutting borders. This phenomenon, called molarization, improved the mastication capacities of the molars, facilitating the processing of tough vegetation. This allowed the cave bear to gain more energy for hibernation, while eating less than its ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Ellen Austin {{supposedly}} {{came across}} a derelict ship, placed on board a prize crew, and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, <b>then</b> <b>disappeared</b> again with a second prize crew on board. A check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of Meta, built in 1854, and that in 1880, Meta was renamed Ellen Austin. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest {{a large number of}} missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared.|$|E
25|$|During the Miocene continents {{continued}} to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent, the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused {{the rise of}} the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula. India {{continued to}} collide with Asia. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and <b>then</b> <b>disappeared</b> as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma (ICS 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis {{near the end of the}} Miocene.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} the three ciphertexts {{originates}} from an 1885 pamphlet detailing treasure being buried {{by a man named}} Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in the 1820s. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and <b>then</b> <b>disappeared,</b> never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{was created by}} Marv Wolfman and Len Wein in the fanzine Super Adventures in 1966. Seven years later John Romita, Sr. tweaked {{the design of the}} character's uniform. Nova debuted in Nova #1 in 1976, written by Wolfman and drawn by John Buscema. Wolfman intended the teenage character to be an homage to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man, down to his humble working-class roots and alliterative alter-ego. The original Nova series, The Man Called Nova, lasted 25 issues from September 1976 to May 1979. Dangling plot lines were resolved in issues 206-214 of Fantastic Four (also by Wolfman) and issue 24 of Rom the Spaceknight. The character <b>then</b> <b>disappeared</b> into obscurity until returning {{as a member of the}} original New Warriors team debuting in The Mighty Thor #411 (December 1989), and continuing through New Warriors #1-75, Annual #1-4 (July 1990—September 1996).|$|E
