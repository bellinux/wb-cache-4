NY224 proceeds eastward along Clawson Boulevard, a two-lane commercial street through Montour Falls. After crossing a creek, the route makes a bend eastward, crossing an intersection with County Route8 (CR8; Skyline Valley Drive), where it turns southeast. A short distance into the bend, NY224 leaves the village of Montour Falls for the town of Montour and drops the moniker of Clawson Boulevard. NY224 becomes a two-lane rural roadway, crossing a valley via a long bridge before bending eastward once again near Havana Glen Road.

25|$|The {{question}} of neighbourhood security {{has been a}} constant focus of research since Oscar Newman's work. New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs–de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a <b>through</b> <b>street.</b> It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.|$|E

[...] Vernon Street is the location of most of the campus' cultural houses and Greek organizations, as well as Vernon Social Center. [...] There are also various residences on that street, including the President's house, the Dean of Students' house, other faculty housing, and the Smith House for visitors. There was an additional street added in 2013, after Trinity bought out the public housing occupying Crescent Street. The college built townhouses on this street, giving an off-campus feel to an on-campus housing option. The 8 to 9- person suites are offered to upperclass students and come at an additional cost to normal dormitory-style living. In 2016, the college announced another addition to Crescent street.
