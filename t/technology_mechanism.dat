40|$|This policy brief {{provides}} a general overview on the setup of the UNFCCC's <b>Technology</b> <b>Mechanism,</b> exploring potential synergies between the mechanism and carbon market instruments {{such as the}} CDM. There are two branches of the Technology Mechanism: the Technology Executive Committee (TEC), which is tasked to give political advice, and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), providing support and fostering the operationalization of technology transfer. Both institutions strongly focus on capacity building. The CDM, instead, has contributed to technology transfer in practice. However, the transfer has largely focused on equipment and basic operational knowledge. The transfer of knowledge to adapt, advance and innovate has been limited so far. Therefore, the two mechanisms could well complement each other. In theory, Programmes of Activities and Standardized Baselines under the CDM could be a means for developing country governments to strategically address financial barriers to technology transfer...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, we have {{witnessed}} the mushrooming of pro- democracy and protest movements {{not only in the}} Arab world, but also within Europe and the Americas. Such movements have ranged from popular upheavals, like in Tunisia and Egypt, to the organization of large- scale demonstrations against unpopular policies, as in Spain, Greece and Poland. What connects these different events are not only their democratic aspirations, but also their innovative forms of communication and organization through online means, which are sometimes considered to be outside of the State’s control. At the same time, however, it has become more and more apparent that countries are attempting to increase their understanding of, and control over, their citizens’ actions in the digital sphere. This involves striving to develop surveillance instruments, control mechanisms and processes engineered to dominate the digital public sphere, which necessitates the assistance and support of private actors such as Internet intermediaries. Examples include the growing use of Internet surveillance technology with which online data traffic is analysed, and the extensive monitoring of social networks. Despite increased media attention, academic debate on the ambivalence of these <b>technologies,</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and techniques remains relatively limited, as is discussion of the involvement of corporate actors.

The results confirm some factors that affect the strength of such links-size of firms, R&D activities and economic sector, and revealed two other factors-incubators ’ statutory situation and firm origin. It also emerges that while the university stake in the incubators’ capital is quite small, and the involvement of firms in R&D activities is rare, {{there is a significant}} formal involvement with the society following a global trend towards “entrepreneurial university”. This suggests that the university contribution to the development of firms ' activities is more related to providing information that complements their technological endeavours, and less to creating innovations, ready for market...|$|E

40|$|Prodrug {{technologies}} {{aimed at}} delivering nucleoside monophosphates into cells (protides) {{have proved to}} be effective in improving the therapeutic potential of antiviral and anticancer nucleosides. In these cases, the nucleoside monophosphates are delivered into the cell, where they may then be further converted (phosphorylated) to their active species. Herein, we describe one of these technologies developed in our laboratories, known as the phosphoramidate protide method. In this approach, the charges of the phosphate group are fully masked to provide efficient passive cell-membrane penetration. Upon entering the cell, the masking groups are enzymatically cleaved to release the phosphorylated biomolecule. The application of this technology to various therapeutic nucleosides has resulted in improved antiviral and anticancer activities, and in some cases it has transformed inactive nucleosides to active ones. Additionally, the phosphoramidate technology has also been applied to numerous antiviral nucleoside phosphonates, and has resulted in at least three phosphoramidate-based nucleotides progressing to clinical investigations. Furthermore, the phosphoramidate technology has been recently applied to sugars (mainly glucosamine) in order to improve their therapeutic potential. The development of the phosphoramidate <b>technology,</b> <b>mechanism</b> of action and the application of the technology to various monophosphorylated nucleosides and sugars will be reviewed. status: publishe...|$|E

Transfer of {{low carbon}} technologies {{to developing countries}} is one approach for tackling rising global emissions. An international technology transfer mechanism has been proposed under the UNFCCC; however, it remains unclear how this international mechanism would translate into local level technology implementation. This study uses biogas technology in South Africa to obtain empirical data inductively related to technology transfer. Observations and activities specific to the biogas sector in South Africa are put forward based on site visits and stakeholder discussions in South Africa, the UK, Germany and Sweden. This paper presents empirical findings on technology transfer in the biogas sector in South Africa and analyses {{the role of an}} international <b>technology</b> <b>mechanism</b> in supporting the uptake of biogas. Many of the barriers to biogas technology in South Africa are national level constraints such as lack of supportive policy environment, financial incentives and information sharing.

Therefore, as demonstrated through the example of biogas technology in South Africa, {{there is a need for}} both effective national and international engagement to support technology implementation...|$|E

Premix of petroleum gas, air and NH 3 were burned in a porous gas burner to generate the needed flue gas. Four kinds of pulverized coal were fed as reburning fuel at constant rate of 1 g/min. The coal reburning process parameters including 15 %~ 25 % reburn heat input, temperature range from 1100 °C to 1400 °C and also the carbon in fly ash, coal fineness, reburn zone stoichiometric ratio, etc. were investigated. On the condition of 25 % reburn heat input, maximum of 47 % NO reduction with Yanzhou coal was obtained by pure coal reburning. Optimal temperature for reburning is about 1300 °C and fuel-rich stoichiometric ratio is essential; coal fineness can slightly enhance the reburning ability. The temperature window for {{ammonia injection}} is about 700 °C~ 1100 °C. CO can improve the NH 3 ability at lower temperature. During advanced reburning, 72. 9 % NO reduction was measured.

A consensus has developed on the importance of dual-use policies, but no agreement seems apparent on what they are; such confusion derives from the variety of dual-use technologies, and the even broader array of mechanisms by which they can be transferred across military and civilian applications. By suggesting a typology of dual-use <b>technology</b> transfer <b>mechanisms</b> this paper provides a platform for the comparison and analysis of different dual-use policies.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} clean development mechanism (CDM) established under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol {{in terms of}} its effectiveness as a vehicle for technology transfer to developing countries, a specific commitment under the UNFCCC. Fundamentally, the paper poses the question of whether technology transfer as part of the CDM is a myth or a reality in the broader context of sustainable development. Technology transfer between countries of the North and South is explored in a historical context and the emergence of technology transfer obligations is traced in multilateral environmental agreements. The architecture of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol are examined in relation to technology transfer obligations. Empirical studies are reviewed to gain an understanding of how CDM operates in practice, with a closer examination of a small number of recent CDM projects. There is an update on the <b>Technology</b> <b>Mechanism</b> being established under the Copenhagen Accord. The paper concludes with a summary of the benefits of CDM to date and its current limitations in achieving the scaling-up of affordable environmentally sound technology transfer envisaged in the Bali Action Plan. The conclusion is that technology transfer must be a much more explicit objective of CDM with better targeting of projects in order to achieve locally sustainable equitable outcomes. Furthermore, the link between CDM and technology transfer needs to be much more explicitly made in order that, in the long run, such interventions will lead to viable low emission development pathways in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{transfer}} is recognised as playing a central and {{critical role in}} the global response to climate change, as embodied in the Unite Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, technology {{transfer is}} a complex process, and despite numerous attempts to prescribe approaches to optimisation, there remain serious obstacles to its effective operation. The breadth of technologies and range of would-be recipient territories under the climate change regime serve to complicate things even further. Against this background, the Expert Group on Technology Transfer have produced a robust Strategy, which it will now fall to the <b>Technology</b> <b>Mechanism</b> announced in Cancun to implement. However, despite the rigour with which the technology transfer strategy was produced, it is never possible to cover all possible eventualities. It is on this basis that this article presents a number of tactical and strategic issues which may merit further consideration as the implementation process moves forward. At the operational level, such issues include a possible role for a centralised or regional technology procurement effort, the need for greater emphasis on sectoral specific approaches to technology transfer, and a pragmatic approach to reducing the impact of some barriers to transactions by the expedient use of insurance to reduce risk, as opposed to the longer term approach of international standardisation. At the strategic level, there are major issues with regard to prioritisation of resources applied to technology transfer, and in particular the resolution of the tensions existing between achieving sustainable development and the time critical need to achieve climate stabilisation...|$|E
40|$|The global {{spotlight}} is {{once again}} focused on the challenges of climate change with the annual United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties kicking off this week (November 28 th–December 7 th) in Durban, South Africa. With the international community looking to Durban for results, an important opportunity exists to address {{one of the most}} contentious – and misunderstood – issues in the climate change debate: the role of intellectual property rights in the production of and access to mitigation and adaptation technologies. The rapid development and diffusion of these technologies is a key component of the global response to climate change. Intellectual property rights have traditionally been the primary policy mechanism for encouraging private investments in innovation, including for the production of mitigation and adaptation technologies. Yet while global climate change negotiations have made some progress in the area of technology transfer, as reflected in last year’s agreement in Cancun to establish a <b>Technology</b> <b>Mechanism</b> under the UNFCCC, the role of intellectual property rights has remained a particularly divisive issue. Not only has no agreement been reached in this area, but even the path to a constructive and meaningful discussion seems elusive. Unless the role of intellectual property is addressed in a constructive and balanced manner, the potential for achieving sustainable and realistic outcomes from the climate talks could be compromised. In this policy brief, we seek to untangle the issues that lie behind this impasse. We also suggest a possible course for action that, while taking into account a diversity of perspectives, also challenges countries – and other stakeholders – to go beyond entrenched negotiating positions...|$|E
