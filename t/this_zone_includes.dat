2500|$|The park {{is divided}} into four zones, which have {{different}} purposes, in order to reconcile {{the protection of the}} park and the welcoming of tourists. This is the first Swedish park to adopt this strict kind of zoning. The majority of the park (60%) is in zone 1, that is to say the untouchable zone: this space {{is the heart of the}} park and only has a tiny amount of tourism infrastructure. The south-east zone of the park (14%) is in zone 2, the low activity area. In this zone, elk hunting is allowed, but infrastructure is always limited. 25% of the park is in zone 3, the high activity zone. <b>This</b> <b>zone</b> <b>includes</b> most of the tourism infrastructure, such as the trails and the cabins. Fishing is authorized there. Finally, zone 4 (about 1% of the area of the park) corresponds to a radius of about [...] around the points of strong concentration of visitors, which is to say the entrances, the waterfall of Njupeskär and the valley of Göljån, where the traces of a great flood are still visible.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} ecological zones in the reserve. The temperate evergreen broadleaf forest includes dominant {{species such as}} Castanopsis cuspidata, silver magnolia, and camellia trees. There are also herbaceous plants such as Ardisia japonica, Hedera rhombea, Saeri trees, and Kalopanax pictus. The dune vegetation zone includes Ischaemum anthephoroides, Zoysia macrostachya, Vitex rotundifolia, Calystegia soldanella, Messerschmidia sibirica, and acolony of Carex kobomugi on Jeungdo Island.

The tidal flat zone includes wetland and coastal areas. Reed and Phragmitis communities are dominant in wetland areas. In the coastal area, various saltmarsh plants are developing such as halophyte communities. Many biological organisms are in the inter-tidal zone. The surface of the tidal flat is an important habitat for diatoms and plankton. Due to the complexity of ecological circulation and the food chain, many shells and invertebrate are found here. The biosphere reserves has two sites {{that are part of the}} RAMSAR Wetland Convention, Jangdo Island High Moor and Jeungdo Tidal Flat ...|$|E
30|$|The in-situ {{values of}} {{permeability}} {{from one of}} the branching faults obtained from Hole 2 (4.4  ×  10 − 16 – 1.5  ×  10 − 15  m 2) can be compared with Zone 2, variably fractured mylonite and cataclasite of very heterogeneous permeability, which has permeability values of 2.28 and 7.01  ×  10 − 16  m 2 for variably fractured Ryoke mylonite in Wibberley and Shimamoto (2003). Although <b>this</b> <b>zone</b> <b>includes</b> a fault gouge that contains smectite (Tanaka et al. 2012), the in-situ permeability at Hole 2 measures the bulk permeability of both the low-permeability fault gouge and surrounding damage zones.|$|E
40|$|Patrick Jager : The Eastern {{limits of}} Europe. Fixing the Eastern {{frontier}} of Europe {{is a complex}} problem that changed over the 18 th Century; it is connected with the value-laden distinction opposing enlightened to barbarian. For travellers, Russia was part of Europe while the Greek Archipelago tended to be outside it. But between these two worlds was a frontier zone which was not a line but an area, a sort of no man's land which finally seems to take on its own cultural identity, being neither European nor Oriental. <b>This</b> <b>zone</b> <b>includes</b> the Archipelago, the Phanariot principalities and part of Russia, but its extent varies.
