5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 1916, Townshend {{launched}} several {{attacks in}} an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad, the Battle of the Wadi, the Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila Redoubt. These attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> heavy with both sides suffering high casualties. In February food, and hopes were running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease spread rapidly and could not be contained or cured and Townshend surrendered in April 1916.

5|$|By 1835 {{the idea}} of {{building}} a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, {{a partner in the}} firm of Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the west of Scotland. Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow {{at the south end of}} Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> to be £550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in England.|$|E

50|$|A {{second point}} about free permits (usually “grandfathered,” i.e. given out in {{proportion}} to past emissions) has often been misunderstood. Companies that receive free permits, treat {{them as if they}} had paid full price for them. This is because using carbon in production has <b>the</b> same <b>cost</b> under both arrangements. With auctioned permits, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> obvious. With free permits, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of not selling the permit at full value — this is termed an “opportunity cost.” Since <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of emissions <b>is</b> generally a marginal cost (increasing with output), <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> passed on by raising <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of output (e.g. raising <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of gasoline or electricity).|$|R
30|$|The path route depends {{mainly on}} how <b>the</b> local <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> computed.

5|$|Cross-river traffic {{increased}} {{following the}} establishment of the Royal Arsenal in 1671. To enable movement of troops and supplies, the army established its own ferry in 1810. The following year an Act of Parliament established a commercial ferry company, but it was dissolved in 1844. In 1846 the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway extended its lines to include a Thames wharf branch; eventually three steam ferries operated, but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand. In October 1880 a public meeting was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam-ferry service, but <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> seen as prohibitive.|$|E
5|$|Hansell's first duty {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, testing repaired aircraft. In June 1930, he spent three months temporary duty with the 6th Field Artillery at Fort Hoyle, Maryland. In September 1930, he returned to Langley Field and was detached to the Air Corps Tactical School as armament officer. While stationed at Langley, Hansell was involved in two minor accidents in aircraft he was piloting, and in early 1931 was forced to parachute to safety when his Boeing P-12 stalled during a test flight, going into an unrecoverable spin. He was found at fault for the accident and initially charged $10,000 by the Air Corps for {{the expense of the}} aircraft, but <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> eventually written off.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, the Internal Revenue Service {{ruled that}} the cost of {{covering}} only the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded 9.5% of income.

5|$|New South Wales and Victoria {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side. In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge. It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> estimated at £78,000. It had been considered {{that it might be}} appropriate to combine these four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to siting concerns.|$|E
5|$|Shaw is commemorated in Kilmarnock {{town centre}} by {{a statue of}} Carrara marble, about 17 feet tall, on a base of Aberdeen granite, {{executed}} by sculptor James Fillans (1808–52). <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> defrayed by public subscription, which raised almost £1000. It was unveiled on 4 August 1848 and was originally located at the Kilmarnock Cross. On 28 March 1929 the statue {{was moved to the}} area of The Dick Institute just off the London Road because of the increase in traffic around the centre of the town.|$|E
5|$|The Beaufort was {{too fast}} for the torpedoes available, so new tactics had to be {{developed}} and the aircraft was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried out more trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> a single Beaufort.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipal}} council voted on 17 February 2011 {{to purchase the}} stadium. The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, while three parties, the Progress Party, the Liberal Party and Red Party, voted against. The proponents argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value than what they had sold, while the opponents {{argued that it was}} not the municipality's responsibility to give financial first-aid to a professional sports club. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> NOK16 million, paid for by taking over debt. After taking over the stadium company, the municipality merged it with Bodø Spektrum, which runs an indoor sports complex, including Nordlandshallen.

40|$|We model {{an agency}} {{relationship}} in which <b>the</b> agent's <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> non-monotonic {{with respect to}} type and the type is correlated with a public ex-post signal. The principal can use lotteries to exploit the type-signal correlation within the limit of the agent's liability.

First, {{the structure of the}} optimal lottery varies across types and, for each type, it depends on whether <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> U shaped or reverse U shaped with respect to type. Second, as compared to the case of monotonic <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> design of incentive compatible lotteries <b>is</b> easier when <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> U shaped, more difficult when <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> reverse U shaped. The root of the second effect is that incentives are non-monotonic either below or above some interior types. The two effects involve that non-monotonicity is unfavorable to the principal when <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> reverse U shaped. This conclusion is at odds with the wisdom, concerning settings without correlated information, that non-monotonicity, which triggers countervailing incentives, enhances contracting...|$|R

5|$|Abelson's studies {{indicated}} {{that in order}} to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to have a much greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where there was space, steam and cooling water, and, perhaps most important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A.
