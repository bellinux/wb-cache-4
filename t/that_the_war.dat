50|$|<b>The</b> Doves countered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam <b>War</b> {{failed to}} defend America, and only united Vietnam with China, nations {{previously}} at odds. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{was not an}} inexpensive means of containing China, but rather a phenomenally expensive one. Mailer took care to note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam <b>War</b> had already consumed itself. Finally, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war’s</b> real damage {{took place in the}} United States, in which it contributed to the deterioration of civil rights and led to the expose of students to drugs and nihilism.|$|R

5|$|After Philip's {{withdrawal}} from his campaign against Rhodes, the Rhodians {{were free to}} attack Olous and Hierapytna and their other Cretan allies. Rhodes' search for allies in Crete bore fruit when the Cretan city of Knossos saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was going in Rhodes' favour and decided to join Rhodes {{in an attempt to}} gain supremacy over the island. Many other cities in central Crete subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous. Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered.|$|E
5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began to recognize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{could no longer be}} won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} {{as a reflection of}} the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an analogy of the invasion of the Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5000|$|McCotter was a {{supporter}} of the United States' involvement in both <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in Afghanistan and <b>the</b> Iraq <b>War.</b> In his 2011 book Seize Freedom!, he wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> [...] "were never separate wars; they have always been battle theaters in <b>the</b> <b>War</b> for Freedom." ...|$|R

50|$|Rafinesque {{had contributed}} to Clifford's letters, adding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>warring</b> Indians were {{ancestors}} to such contemporary tribes as the Lenape. He theorized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> later Indian ancestors had crossed to North America over the frozen Bering Strait from Asia.|$|R
5|$|His {{influence}} over Confederate strategy was lessened by his poor professional relationships with President Jefferson Davis and other senior generals and officials. In April 1865, Beauregard and his commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, convinced Davis {{and the remaining}} cabinet members <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> needed to end. Johnston surrendered {{most of the remaining}} armies of the Confederacy, including Beauregard and his men, to Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Following his military career, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he served as a railroad executive, and became wealthy as a promoter of the Louisiana Lottery.|$|E
5|$|Increasing violence, {{especially}} by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the American Revolution, as some hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.|$|E
5|$|Keyes {{supports}} {{an amendment}} to the Constitution barring same-sex marriage. He stated he would not have gone to war in Iraq, but also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was justified and defended President George W. Bush's decision in one of his 2004 debates. Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq, but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, realizing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Madi and Acholi-Madi {{people had}} been taken in by the {{calamity}} brought by the polarization in the society, {{in order to stop}} further tragedies, the Madi and Acholi elders decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>warring</b> parties reach out to each other.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{support for}} Louis' {{campaign}} was diminishing in France, and he concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce {{his claim to}} the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce {{the charter of the}} previous year. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 1945, at his {{afternoon}} situation conference, Hitler {{fell into}} a tearful rage (famously dramatized in the 2004 German film Downfall) when he realised that his plans, prepared the previous day, could not be achieved. He declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was lost, blaming the generals for the defeat {{and that he would}} remain in Berlin until the end and then kill himself.|$|E
5|$|Other Hispanic servicewomen like Contreras and Cubria served {{either in}} the WAACs, WAVES or MCWR (Marine Corps Women's Reserve); among them Lieutenant Junior Grade Maria Rodriguez-Denton.

5|$|Resistance to the German {{occupiers}} {{began in}} Belgium {{in the winter}} of 1940, after the German defeat in the Battle of Britain made it clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was not lost for the Allies. Involvement in illegal resistance activity was a decision made by a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in passive resistance. If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution, and around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E
5|$|The Allied naval bombardments {{disrupted}} {{industrial production}} in the cities targeted, and convinced many Japanese civilians <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was lost. Up to 1,739 Japanese {{were killed in the}} attacks, and as many as 1,497 were wounded. The only Allied casualties were 32 prisoners of war, who were killed in the bombardments of Kamaishi.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{date of the}} war's end is {{also not}} universally agreed upon. It was {{generally}} accepted at the time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany {{to take place in}} 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.|$|E
5|$|Although {{instrumental}} in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally {{did not want}} to swear allegiance to the British government, and he chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States. Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was over, the tour failed, forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands. Here his health failed him again, leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society).|$|E
5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E
