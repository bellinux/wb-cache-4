5|$|According {{to former}} English paceman Bill Bowes, England had {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Test</b> {{with the intention}} of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior, reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics. Bowes himself believed the tactics to be correct and almost successful. However, he suspected that Walter Robins, one of the selectors, considered the English strategy to be misguided and that they should attack the Australians. This was reflected in the English selections. The home team made three changes; the leg spinner Doug Wright, who was forced to withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Test</b> at late notice due to lumbago, had regained his fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox spin of Young, who had taken match figures of 1/107 in the First TestAustralian wicket-keeper Don Tallon was his only wicket. However, he had managed to keep the batsmen quiet with his defensive leg theory, bowling 60 overs for 79 runs; Wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler. Jim Laker, who had been called into <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Test</b> team due to Wright's lumbago, was initially the third spinner in the pecking order, but he took 4/138, including three specialist batsmen, and was retained.|$|E
5|$|Barring one {{change in}} the bowling department, the same team went on to be {{selected}} for <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Test,</b> with the top six batsmen in the same position. Brown made only 26 as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.|$|E

40|$|A cavity {{quantum electrodynamics}} system {{consisting}} of quantum dots in a micropillar cavity may form an essential building block {{for the creation}} of a quantum network. Current systems do not allow for the scaling, in a simple manner, to a large network. Therefore, we introduce a scalable approach by coupling a micropillar cavity to single-mode fibers. The steps taken to achieve the fiber coupling are explained and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>tests</b> for researching a fiber coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics system are shown. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>tests</b> show that full input-output fiber based polarization control of a micropillar cavity at 3. 5 K is possible which is important for a photon polarization based quantum network. Several experimental challenges are shown and discussed. Despite the experimental challenges, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>tests</b> may pave <b>the</b> way for a more scalable approach for building a large-scale quantum network...|$|R

Collins was only the fifth Australian to make a century on Test début. Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval, batting 258 minutes for 162, helping Australia to a 119 run victory. Over the 1920–1921 series, Collins made 557 runs {{at an average of}} 61.88.|$|E
