5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges. However, {{when they learned}} of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E
50|$|Inspired {{during his}} {{research}} for his thesis, Billings {{recognized the need}} for an index and a catalog of medical periodicals and books. In Billings’ late career, he developed <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Library, which later became the core of the National Library of Medicine. From 1865 to 1873, Billings expanded <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Library from 600 volumes to over 50 000 volumes. During his time as Director of the Library of <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Library, 1865-1895, he was responsible for the creation of both the Index Medicus (33 d.C.) and the Index Catalogue of <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Office (S IV a.C.).|$|R

5|$|The Federal Security Administrator was {{required}} by law to appoint an advisory committee for federal nurse training programs. The committee, which was appointed for the Nurse Training Act, consisted of people in nursing and related fields drawn from various parts of the country. Once in place, the committee met with designated federal officials and formulated the regulations necessary to carry out the act. The agreed-upon rules were then approved by <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> and published in the Federal Register. The committee was also responsible for naming the new program. The Victory Nurse Corps and the Student War Nursing Reserve were considered, but both were rejected in favor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1905, American author Molly Elliot Seawell sailed for Europe on Kroonland on a {{day when}} six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, {{departed}} New York. In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and was met by her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted both good and bad design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk.|$|E

25|$|Music therapy {{finds its}} roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which {{described}} the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal {{of the study was to}} understand whether “music presented according to a specific plan” influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders. Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.|$|E
