25|$|The second {{match was}} between Lance Storm and <b>The</b> <b>Cat.</b> <b>The</b> match started {{back and forth}} until Storm gained the {{advantage}} with punches and lariats. <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> fought back, but Elix Skipper, who accompanied Storm, pulled <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> out of <b>the</b> ring, and attacked him. Storm sent <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> into <b>the</b> guard rail, and performed a missile dropkick. <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> fought back briefly until Jim Duggan came down, and hit him. Storm forced <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> to submit with the Canadian Maple Leaf, and won the match. After the match, Skipper and Storm beat down Duggan until <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> fought them off.|$|R
50|$|Porky then chases <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> with <b>the</b> shotgun until <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> sings Rock-a-Bye Baby, which lulls Porky to sleep. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> then wakes Porky up by {{conducting}} the loud music {{playing on the}} radio (Frat), before running out and singing The Umbrella Man, an American hit recorded in 1938 by Kay Kyser's dance orchestra. Porky locks down the window, but <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> reopens <b>the</b> door and sings Jeepers Creepers. Porky chases him out again, only for <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> to slam <b>the</b> door open into Porky before shutting it behind him. When <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> is outside singing Make Love With a Guitar, Porky grabs his gun and shoots <b>the</b> <b>cat,</b> who manages to gasp out a chorus of Aloha 'Oe, and dies.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>cat</b> enters <b>the</b> {{house next}} to Ralph's house, finding {{a chance to}} grab <b>the</b> mice. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> puts his mouth against the mousehole so that Ralph and Ned enter <b>the</b> <b>cat's</b> body. Ralph lights a match in the {{darkness}} making smoke and <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> regurgitates <b>the</b> mice. The mice walk on thinking they entered the wrong place. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> goes into Ralph's house through a grate. Ralph and Ned cautiously enter the house thinking their wives are sleeping soundly.

5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{evidence}} for the domestication of cats 5,300 years ago in Quanhucun, China has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the University of Washington and Chinese Academy of Sciences. <b>The</b> <b>cats</b> {{are believed to have}} been attracted to the village by rodents, which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Filmation began {{producing}} several new {{series for the}} Big Three television networks.

While {{a majority of the}} series was animated, live-action segments involving actual animals were also included to separate different scenes in an episode. According to Scheimer, filming with the animals was tough, as the bulldog who portrayed Tyrone would often chase <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> on set around and not stay still during filming.|$|E

5|$|The large {{populations of}} {{tortoises}} and marine turtles on Rodrigues {{resulted in the}} export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.|$|E

5|$|The role of Mr. Jinx the cat {{was played}} by two five-year-old Himalayan cats named Bailey and Misha (sometimes written as Meesha).

5|$|Because the Goathouse Refuge offers their 300 cats (number as of January 2013) medical {{treatment}} on-site, quality food, toys and comfort {{items such as}} lots of blankets, the cost of maintaining {{is higher than the}} average shelter.

Scarpa's fundraisers use themes such as Burrito Bash, Venetian Carnival, Garden Gourmands, and Mad Hatter's Tea Party.

5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of <b>the</b> <b>cats,</b> and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> raising and tilting its head.|$|E
5|$|Hawkwing's Journey is the 9th Super Edition {{novel that}} was {{released}} on 1 November 2016. It follows Hawkwing a apprentice, warrior and eventual deputy of Skyclan.

Leafstar, the leader of Skyclan decides that the gorge is lost and that the clan's only hope {{is to find the}} rest of the Warrior Clans. So Skyclan sets out searching for the Lake territories.

When <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> realizes that he can’t do it all by himself, he brings in helpers, which Burdorff suggests may represent the working public, the underclass, or the democratic citizenry.
