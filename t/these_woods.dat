Forests cover 80% of the park's area, with old-growth forest forming 30% of them. <b>These</b> <b>woods</b> {{are the last}} remaining temperate forests with evergreen laurel undergrowth in Europe. The park has {{the highest number of}} vertebrate species of all protected areas in Bulgaria, including 66 species of mammals, 269 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibia and 41 species of freshwater fish, as well as 70 species of marine fish in the waters of the Black Sea. The invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and includes 84 Bulgarian endemic species, of which 4 are local, and 34 relict species.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for <b>these</b> <b>woods</b> has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E

Examples are heavy structural timbers with high density such as ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata), blackbutt (E. pilularis), southern blue gum (E. globulus) and brush box (Lophostemon cofertus). They require considerable protection and care against rapid drying conditions for the best results (Bootle, 1994).|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to find American Windsors made in the 18th century that contain three {{different}} species of wood. Pine, bass or tulip poplar are common for the seat. Non ring porous hardwoods such as Maple are stiff and make crisp turnings, and {{were used for the}} undercarriage. Ring porous species such as Oak, ash, and hickory all rive (split) and steam bend nicely. <b>These</b> <b>woods</b> are also straight grained and flexible and thus work well for slender parts such as the spindles.|$|E

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the {{territory}} of the Netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests. In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like Scots pine and trees that are not native to the Netherlands. <b>These</b> <b>woods</b> were planted on anthropogenic heaths and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) (Veluwe).|$|E

25|$|Bryophytes, lichens and filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae), {{thrive in}} the humid oceanic climate. Species with {{restricted}} Atlantic distributions grow in the woods. The bryophytes in <b>these</b> <b>woods</b> are perhaps the best-developed Atlantic bryophyte community in Europe. The remote Glaism na Marbh valley has a particularly rich flora of bryophytes, {{some of which are}} scarce or absent {{in other parts of the}} woods. Mosses, ferns and liverworts frequently occur as epiphytes, attached to the trunks and branches of oak trees. Rare species growing in the woods include Cyclodictyon laetivirens, Daltonia splachnoides, Lejeunea flava, Radula carringtonii, and Sematophyllum demissum.|$|E
25|$|Most djembes from Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Senegal {{are still}} hand carved from {{traditional}} species of wood, using traditional tools and methods. In the 1990s, djembes started being produced elsewhere, {{such as in}} Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, and Indonesia, often using modern machinery and substitute species of wood, such as tweneboa (Cordia platythyrsa) or mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni or Toona sureni). However, <b>these</b> <b>woods,</b> being softer and less dense, are not as suitable as the traditional woods. A number of western percussion instrument manufacturers also produce djembe-like instruments, often with fibreglass bodies, synthetic skins, and a key tuning system.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the years}} {{following}} 1639 <b>these</b> <b>woods</b> were known as Thornhaugh Woods (also called 'the High Woods of Thornhaw'), being the principal woodland of the parish of Thornhaugh. The name Bedford Purlieus resulted from its association with the Earls and Dukes of Bedford, but it also reveals its more ancient history {{as a part of}} a Royal Forest. The woods came into the Russell family almost at the start of their rise to landed wealth. In 1526 John Russell married Anne Sapcote, an heiress whose property included the Thornhaugh Woods. He went on to be created Earl of Bedford by Henry VIII and was granted a vast estate at Woburn Abbey by Edward VI. Baron Russell of Thornhaugh in the County of Northampton (1603) is one of the subsidiary titles of the Dukes of Bedford.|$|E

However, the {{relationships}} between the MCf and <b>these</b> <b>wood</b> properties could not be sufficiently described by the PCR, because there are complex interrelations between the MCf and the wood properties and some of the interrelations are nonlinear, which cannot be modeled by the PCR. Therefore, a nonlinear approach is more useful in describing their relationships and predicting the MCf of wood.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} archaeological {{features}} visible within the woods, including medieval wood banks, small quarry pits, signs of Roman industrial use and a Roman dwelling place. The first archaeological excavations {{were carried out}} by Edmund Tyrell Artis (1789–1847), the Steward of the nearby FitzWilliam estate, {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. He suggested a Roman villa site, and the presence of iron working and furnaces within the wood, and in 1965 the Peterborough Museum Society found and excavated furnaces within the woods. Little was then investigated until the 2011 series of archaeological television programme Time Team, which included a LIDAR survey and an archaeological dig within <b>these</b> <b>woods.</b> They confirmed that iron extraction from pits within the woodland, Roman iron smelting sites, and other evidence of Roman industry implied an industrial centre that was significant for Roman British iron supplies. A Roman bath-house, with surviving painted wall plaster may indicate an overseer's residence.|$|E
2500|$|In the ravines {{and on the}} {{mountain}} slopes are copses or small woods of tabaquillo and mayten, called in {{the mountain}} zone [...] "quebracho", the coexistence {{of which is a}} unique biogeographical phenomenon. The tabaquillo has relatives which are distributed the length of the Andes from Venezuela to Argentina, while the mayten originates from the woodlands of south-west Argentina (the cool Andean-Patagonian woodland). The greatest density of <b>these</b> <b>woods</b> is in the bottoms of the ravines, where they acquire a low forest physiognomy with great quantities of ferns and epiphytes. Both the grasslands and the woodlands of the pampas and of the ravines respectively are composed of plants of very diverse origins. Some, approaching from the eastern slopes of the mountainous area, are native to the Austro-Brazilian region. Other species of specifically Andean origin have in the Pampa de Achala their most southerly distribution. On the other hand, numerous species of the south of Argentina find in this region their most northerly habitat.|$|E
2500|$|In {{southern}} Britain, coppice was traditionally hazel, hornbeam, beech, ash or oak, grown amongst oak {{or sometimes}} ash or beech standards. In wet areas alder and willows were used. [...] These coppices provided wood for many purposes, especially charcoal, which before coal was economically significant in metal smelting. A minority of <b>these</b> <b>woods</b> are still operated for coppice today, often by conservation organisations, producing material for hurdle-making, thatching spars, local charcoal-burning or other crafts. The only remaining large-scale commercial coppice crop in England is sweet chestnut which is grown {{in parts of}} Sussex and Kent. Much of this was established as plantations in the 19th century for hop-pole production (hop-poles are used to support the hop plant while growing hops) and is nowadays cut on a 12 to 18-year cycle for splitting and binding into cleft chestnut paling fence, or on a 20- to 35-year cycle for cleft post-and-rail fencing, or for sawing into small lengths to be finger-jointed for architectural use. Other material goes to make farm fencing and to be chipped for modern wood-fired heating systems.|$|E

2500|$|Yew is {{a native}} {{evergreen}} tree that grows best in the high humidity of mild oceanic climates, which makes Killarney a very suitable location. The soil in the wood is mostly thin and in many places the trees are rooted to fissures in the bare limestone. Yew has an extensive horizontal root system. In the Killarney woods, the roots spread out over the rock surface and penetrate deeply into fissures in the limestone. The wood has a low canopy of 6–14 m (20–46ft). Yew's extreme tolerance of the dense shade its canopy creates has allowed it to out compete other species to create the pure yew woodland present today. This dense shade prevents flowering plants from establishing themselves in <b>these</b> <b>woods</b> and prevents the herb layer from developing. Bryophytes are however abundant and thrive in the humid and cool conditions. In {{some parts of the}} wood there are continuous dense blankets of moss that can be up to [...] deep. The moss species present are primarily Thamnium alopecurum with Eurhynchium striatum and Thuidium tamariscinum.|$|E
