500|$|However, Montagu did not {{profit from}} the new regime as he {{probably}} expected to. He did not regain the Earldom of Northumberland. Further, he lost some of the Courtney lands that had come with his Marquessate to the newly returned Earl of Devon. Montagu had no active role in government, and {{does not seem to}} have sat in Council, although he was appointed Chamberlain to the King's Household. Although he was confirmed in command of the new King's forces in the north and in possession of the manor of Wressle on 21 March 1471, he did not regain any other Percy estates. Indeed, it has been suggested that his loyalty might still have been suspect by the newly arrived Lancastrians: having been summoned to the November 1470 parliament, Polydor Virgil states that he had to apologise there for his prior support of Edward. [...] Montagu even had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash</b> for the king's pardon, which he only received after making a lengthy speech, declaring that he had only remained faithful to Edward out of fear.|$|E
500|$|Although {{for much}} of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly {{preferred}} the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, [...] "In piano music there's no room for padding – one has <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash</b> and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all." [...] Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as [...] "Piano piece No X". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, [...] "the greater they are, the worse they play me." [...] Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, [...] "I've run out of fingers". [...] Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns wrote to him in 1917, [...] "Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to {{get to the end of}} it by dint of absolute determination." ...|$|E

Klein's reforms for Alberta would have permitted for-profit care and {{made it possible to}} jump queues, to [...] "allow patients <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash</b> for some surgery and let doctors practice in both the public and private health systems."

[...] and remarked that I was an Englishman, and that they had better be careful. I also told them that they could dismiss any idea of ransom from their minds at once, unless they were prepared to take I.O.U.'s, as it was against the principles of our family <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash</b> for anything--certainly not for relatives.|$|E

60|$|Every {{one seemed}} sorry {{that the old}} lady had gone away. But Mr. Tolman was so {{pleasant}} and anxious to please, and took such an interest in their selection of books, that {{only one of the}} subscribers appeared to take the change very much to heart. This was a young man who was forty-three cents in arrears. He was a long time selecting a book, and when at last he brought it to Mr. Tolman to be entered, he told him in a low voice that he hoped there would be no objection to letting his account run on for a little while longer. On the first of the month he would settle it, and then he hoped to be able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash</b> whenever he brought in a book.|$|E

"Well, {{after this}} little {{experience}} I thought that I would settle down a bit, so I entered upon a venture {{with a man}} who, being of a speculative mind, had conceived the idea of running a store at Pretoria upon strictly cash principles. The arrangement was that I should find the capital and he the experience. Our partnership was not of a long duration. The Boers refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash,</b> {{and at the end}} of four months my partner had the capital and I had the experience. After this I came to the conclusion that store-keeping was not in my line, and having four hundred pounds left, I sent my boy Harry to a school in Natal, and buying an outfit with what remained of the money, started upon a big trip.|$|E

There are billions of money in this enterprise, no expensive plant is required, and I shall begin to realize in a few days--in a few weeks at furthest.

6000|$|... "Very dull indeed. We {{have had}} {{literally}} no goods whatever from the interior. Of course production has fallen off very greatly, and {{the sale of}} Egyptian products at Cairo, to the troops, has been considerable. Then, too, the disturbed state {{of the country has}} prevented the manufacturers from sending valuable goods down here, so that practically that part of the business has been at a standstill, and I have not attempted to accumulate a stock. However I have lately purchased many large lots from native traders here who feared that their shops might be pillaged {{in the event of a}} riot, and especially lately when they were afraid that if your people took the town by storm there might be a general sack. So as I was certain that the French must go before long, and I got all these goods at a bargain, I have bought freely. Then I have not done badly with goods run in by French ships that managed to slip through the blockade, and which were laden with speculative cargoes of luxuries for the army. As we are almost the only European house open, and I was able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash,</b> I bought things up largely, and realized very good profits by supplying the native shops here and the officers of the garrison, and also sent a great deal of wine and goods of that sort up to Cairo, getting leave from the commandant here for them to go up under the guard of any body of troops that happened to be proceeding there, so that altogether the firm had not done badly, all things considered." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the three}} met, the bargain was soon struck. As each party was so desirous of making it, few {{difficulties}} were interposed. The old lady, indeed, {{was in favor}} of some delay in the transfer of the establishment, as she would like to clean and dust every shelf and corner and every article in the place. But Mr. Tolman was in a hurry to take possession; and as the son Henry would have to start off on another trip in a short time, he wanted to see his mother moved and settled before he left. There was not much to move but trunks and bandboxes, and some antiquated pieces of furniture of special value to the old lady, for Mr. Tolman insisted on buying everything in the house, just as it stood. The whole thing did not cost him, he said to himself, as much as some of his acquaintances would pay for a horse. The methodical son Henry took an account of stock, and Mr. Tolman took several lessons from the old lady, in which she explained to him how to find out the selling prices of the various articles from the marks on the little tags attached to them. And she particularly instructed him in the management of the circulating library. She informed him of the character of the books, and, as far as possible, of the character of the regular patrons. She told him whom he might trust to take out a book without paying for the one brought in, if they didn't happen to have the change with them, and she indicated with little crosses opposite their names those persons who should be required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cash</b> down for what they had had, before receiving further benefits.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} with undergraduates as subjects {{were carried out}} {{with the aim of}} replicating and extending previous results showing that the implication of the behavioral life-cycle hypothesis (H. M. Shefrin & R. H. Thaler, 1988) that people classify assets in different mental accounts (current income, current assets, and future income) may explain how consumption choices are influenced by temporary income changes. In both experiments subjects made fictitious choices between paying for a good in cash or according to a more expensive installment plan after they had received an income which was either less, the same, or larger than usual. In Experiment 1 subjects were supposed to have savings so that the total assets were equal, whereas in Experiment 2 the total assets varied. The results of both experiments supported the role of mental accounts in demonstrating that subjects were unwilling <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> in <b>cash</b> after an income decrease even though they had access to saved money. Thus, in effect they chose <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for the good than they had to. Indicating a need for further refinement of the concept of mental account, choices <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> in <b>cash</b> after an income decrease tended to be more frequent when the consumption and savings motives were compatible than when they were incompatible. Furthermore, increasing the total assets made subjects more willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> in <b>cash</b> after an income decrease...|$|R
