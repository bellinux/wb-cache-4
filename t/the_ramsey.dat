5|$|Although Germanus's {{name is not}} Anglo-Saxon, Byrhtferth, a {{contemporary}} who wrote the Vita Oswaldi, which contains much information on Germanus, states {{that he was a}} native of Winchester. Germanus accompanied Oscytel, the Archbishop of York, and Oswald of Worcester, on their trip to Rome in about 957, purportedly to collect Oscytel's pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. This journey, however, has been challenged by the historian Donald Bullough, who argues that no previous archbishops of York had collected their palliums in person. He also points out that this story is only related in the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis, the chronicle of <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Abbey. According to <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> story, Oscytel and Oswald returned to England, but Germanus remained on the continent and became a monk at Fleury Abbey in France. Another story has Oswald journeying to Fleury on his own, with Germanus arriving at Fleury after Oswald had been resident at Fleury {{for a number of years}} prior to 958.|$|E
5|$|At William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, 11planes {{were damaged}} when a hangar collapsed, {{resulting}} in losses of $250,000. Hermann Park was also {{affected by the}} storm, where nine goats began to roam within the park due to a broken fence caused by a fallen limb. 35convicts were freed from <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Unit state prison during the storm due to the chance of the prison collapsing. However, after the storm, only eight returned to the prison, leaving 27others missing.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{also the}} county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day {{metropolitan}} area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated. Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts. The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> County Sheriff's office.|$|E
50|$|The first 16 stakes winners sired by Kitten's Joy were bred by <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys</b> {{and most}} of them also raced for <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys.</b> Even as his {{reputation}} grew, <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey's</b> were still <b>the</b> breeders of 54 of his first 68 stakes winners. Three of Kitten's Joy's progeny won Grade I races on the same day, August 17, 2013 - Big Blue Kitten (Sword Dancer Invitational Handicap), Real Solution (Arlington Million), and Admiral Kitten (Secretariat Stakes) - all of them Ramsey homebreds. As a result, when Kitten's Joy led the sire list in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys</b> were also <b>the</b> leading breeders and owners, winning Eclipse Awards in these categories. Over time though, more of his offspring were produced from outside mares, including his first Group 1 winner in Europe, Hawkbill, who won the 2016 Eclipse Stakes.|$|R

5|$|Athens' local {{music is}} based {{primarily}} in the small downtown area of {{the northern part of}} the town. The nightclub 40 Watt Club is among the most famous indie rock venues on the East Coast; the club opened on Halloween in 1978, with a band called Strictly American featuring Curtis Crowe, founder of the club and future member of the band Pylon. Other major music venues in the city include the Georgia Theater, (a converted cinema that hosted both local and touring performers. The Theater burned down in June 2009, but has been fully remodelled into a state of the art music venue reopening in early August 2011), the Caledonia Lounge, the historic Foundry Music Venue (which was originally built in 1850 as an iron foundry), and the UGA Performing Arts Center, home to <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Concert Hall and the Hugh Hodgson Concert Hall. The Morton Theater is a historic venue, a major part of the city's African American community in the early 20th century; it claims to be the only theater from that era remaining in operation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} days of the shutdown, many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social service organizations that relied on state funding. To hear their pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> County District Court when the shutdown began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the shutdown, and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E
5|$|Route 17 enters Allendale, with {{businesses}} resuming {{along the}} road. It enters Upper Saddle River before running through Ramsey, {{where the road}} crosses back into Upper Saddle River. The route comes to an interchange with County Route 81 (Lake Street/Crescent Avenue), where it crosses back into Ramsey. In Ramsey, Route 17 turns to the northwest and features a RIRO for County Route 83 (Airmount Avenue), an interchange with County Route 507 (Franklin Turnpike), and an interchange for Island Avenue/Spring Street. The route passes over New Jersey Transit’s Bergen County Line/Main Line near <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Route 17 train station and enters Mahwah. In Mahwah, Route 17 interchanges with County Route 85 (Island Road) and County Route 100 (Ramapo Avenue). North of Ramapo Avenue, Route 17 features an interchange with U.S. Route 202 and crosses the Ramapo River. Route 17 has an interchange with Mountainside Avenue and Crossroads Boulevard just before merging with six-lane Interstate 287, which it follows to the New York border, where the road continues into Hillburn, Rockland County as Interstate 287 and New York State Route 17, intersecting Interstate 87 (the New York State Thruway) shortly after the state line.|$|E
