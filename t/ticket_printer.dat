50|$|Finally, it also {{manufactures}} wheel {{sets for}} coaches and wagons. Jamalpur workshop {{was a significant}} supplier of cast-iron sleepers as well. Starting in 1961 it produced several rail cranes.

50|$|Transactions are {{any action}} {{that has a}} {{monetary}} implication or transfer information from one media to another. The most commonly thought of transactions are the use of credit or debit cards through a card reader of some type. Card readers are also widely used for hotel door locks or access control devices. Another {{of the most common}} is a currency transaction via vending, slot machines, or self-checkout kiosk where a bill acceptor takes currency or a currency detector tabulates quantity. Many printers are transaction devices such as cashless <b>ticket</b> <b>printers</b> in the gaming industry.|$|R
50|$|The Shere SMART ("SMART Terminal") is a desktop-based railway ticket issuing system, {{developed}} by the Guildford-based company Shere Ltd, utilising Newbury Data ND4020 <b>ticket</b> <b>printer,</b> first introduced in Britain in 2003. Since the first trial installation of the system in the ticket office at London Bridge station, approximately 300 terminals have been installed at stations on the Southern and former Thameslink networks.|$|E
50|$|The machine {{as a whole}} {{consists}} of a specialised PDA device, upon which all fare, timetable and other data is stored; a small <b>ticket</b> <b>printer</b> and its batteries; the blank ticket stock; and a ticket cradle which holds the tickets when they have been printed. The printer and ticket stock are housed within a plastic case into which the PDA slides.|$|E
50|$|Pickpocketing {{has been}} a problem since the start; even the Chief of Police in Oslo has been robbed on the train. The train has also been the target of sabotage, and {{embezzlement}} for NOK 1 million by an employed ticket salesman, who found a way to print two tickets with the system only charging for one, by turning off and on the <b>ticket</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fare {{validation}} requires substantial infrastructure (paid/unpaid areas), labour-intensive manual ticket examinations, {{and consequent}} speed-accuracy trade-offs. During the 2000s, TRA incrementally replaced older thermal <b>ticket</b> <b>printers</b> with {{automated fare collection}} (AFC) devices using magnetic-backed stock. Busy stations have faregates to speed up validation. Tickets can be inserted in any orientation. Gates align, check, and mechanically punch tickets prior to opening. Validations are fast and can be [...] "pipelined" [...] or [...] "stacked" [...] (i.e. following passenger can insert ticket while previouspassenger is proceeding through the gate). Passenger counting sensors quickly close gates when as many passengers entered as valid tickets processed. When exiting, faregates collect and cancel single trip tickets.|$|R
50|$|Jamalpur Workshop, {{the first}} {{full-fledged}} railway workshop facility in India, was opened on 8 February 1862, {{at a time}} when the Howrah-Delhi main line, passing through Jamalpur was under construction. It was felt that communities of gun smiths and other craftsmen in the area handling mechanical engineering jobs could pick up the skills required in a railway workshop. It undertook repairs of wagons, coaches, cranes and tower cars, and locomotives, as well as manufacture of some tower cars, break-down cranes and various kinds of heavy-duty lifting jacks. They also produced their own locomotives, starting with the CA 764 Lady Curzon in 1899. It has also produced <b>ticket</b> <b>printers</b> and other <b>ticket</b> machines (slitting, counting, and chopping). With fairly extensive workshop facilities, it was a fairly self-contained.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{different}} practice {{involved the}} issuance of [...] "interagency transfers" [...] where a rider was switching between one bus line (bus company) and another, e.g. Torrance Transit to Orange County Transit. RTD issued one transfer, which was good locally on its own system {{for all of its}} bus routes and functioned as an interagency transfer for credit toward the fare on a different bus line. All other bus lines issued an [...] "interagency transfer" [...] different from their own local transfers. It was believed that the reason for this was that RTD actually printed the interagency transfers and sold them to all the other bus lines. In the early 1980s, Long Beach Transit would also break from this system, and would have <b>ticket</b> <b>printers</b> installed on every bus to issue both local (Long Beach Transit-based) and interagency transfers (drivers would, in case the printer failed, keep a book of Long Beach and standard interagency transfer for just such emergencies.) ...|$|R

50|$|Agar had met Pierce {{years earlier}} when Pierce {{had worked as}} a <b>ticket</b> <b>printer</b> for the railway company. When Agar {{returned}} to England after some time in Australia and America, he met Pierce again and they discussed the possibility of stealing some of the gold frequently shipped between London and Paris on the South Eastern railway. Pierce appears to have been the originator of the plan, and suggested that he could get hold of impressions of the keys to the safes which protected the gold. He was assisted by his associate, railway guard James Burgess.|$|E
50|$|Ticket-in, ticket out (TITO) {{machines}} {{are used in}} casino slot machines to print out {{a slip of paper}} with a barcode indicating the amount of money represented. These can in turn be redeemed for cash at an automated kiosk. The machines utilize a barcode scanner built into the bill acceptor, a thermal <b>ticket</b> <b>printer</b> in place of a coin hopper (some rare {{machines are}} set up to pay with coins if the payout is less than the payout limit, and to print a ticket in situations where a handpay would normally be required) and a network interface to communicate with a central system that tracks tickets.|$|E
40|$|Background Decision-related {{effort is}} an {{important}} factor in understanding consumers’ decision-making and consumption behavior. For example, it is assumed that consumers attempt to reduce decision-related effort in their decision-making (Bettman, Luce, and Payne 1998; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993). In fact, several research streams suggest a direct relationship between effort and decision-making. Particularly speaking, they suggest that effort influences: (i) the selection of decision heuristics (e. g., compensatory vs. noncompensatory rules, Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993); (ii) the justification for choosing luxury over necessity goods or choosing a more-risky over a less-risky option (Kivetz 2003; Kivetz and Simonson 2002); and (iii) the evaluation of objects (Kruger, Wirtz, Boven, and Altermatt 2004). Specifically, Kruger et al. (2004) introduce the concept of “effort heuristics. ” They propose that people have a tendency to use effort as a basis for their evaluations. They provide empirical evidence by showing that the participants in their study evaluated a poem more favorably when they thought that the poet took more time (i. e., 18 hours) to write the poem than when they thought that the poet took less time (i. e., 4 hours). In this study, the effort that the poet spent, however, is not related to the decision per se, and the decision-maker did not generate any decision–related effort. Thus, the effort investigated in Kruger et al. (2004) ’s research involves other- rather than selfgenerated effort. In this study, we are more interested in investigating the impact of decision-related effort on product evaluation and price judgment toward a chosen option. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of self-generated or/and decision-related effort on the evaluation of a decision outcome (i. e., a chosen alternative). Decision-related effort {{is an important}} factor in understanding consumers’ decision-making and consumption behavior. In this research, we examine how decision-related effort influences evaluation and price judgment (i. e., WTA or WTP) for a chosen option. Two experiments demonstrate that consumers’ evaluations and price judgments are higher for an option that requiring high effort than for an option requiring low effort with respect to two products: lottery <b>tickets</b> and <b>printers.</b> This research also shows that this result can be moderated by the time interval between a choice and a subsequent judgment...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the company changed its {{transfer}} system. Instead of using books of transfers, every bus has a <b>ticket</b> <b>printer,</b> which issues {{the three types}} of transfers: regular transfers, which allow the user to transfer to a different route; [...] "emergency" [...] transfers (typically used if the customer becomes sick and has to get off the bus), which allow the user {{to get back on the}} same route; and interagency transfers, which allow the user to transfer to a different bus company (and gave the user an additional 1 hour of time before it expires), such as Orange County Transit, MTA, Norwalk Transit and Cerritos Transit (now Cerritos on Wheels) buses. In case of machine failure, however, operators would still carry one book of each kind of transfers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the early {{results of the}} multidisciplinary project Tivipol aiming to propose ICT devices to enhance the daily life of older people in a retirement home. A prototype combining a tactile color screen, a RFID reader and a <b>ticket</b> <b>printer</b> has been designed. It allows the older people to manage their usual activities in the retirement home (e. g. reserving their menu for the next days at the cafeteria). A first formative evaluation carried out with five residents of the home has shown {{the high level of}} usability and possible acceptance of the new system. This ongoing research is intended to find out which elements {{play a key role in}} the acceptation and diffusion of a ICT-based technology among elderly people in good physical and mental conditions...|$|E
