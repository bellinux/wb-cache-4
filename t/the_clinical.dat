5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. <b>The</b> <b>clinical</b> course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|As many of <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{clinical}} pathway support {{system on the}} Internet (CPSSI) has been designed for creating and implementing a web-based {{clinical pathway}} for radical prostatectomy. This investigation assessed the effects of <b>the</b> web-based <b>clinical</b> pathway for radical prostatectomy on practice variations.

Variations before and following the implementation of <b>the</b> web-based <b>clinical</b> pathway for radical prostatectomy were also assessed. The CPSSI automatically measured pathway variations and length of hospital stay. Results: After implementing <b>the</b> web-based <b>clinical</b> pathway, <b>the</b> average hospital stay was reduced significantly (p = 0. 0001).
