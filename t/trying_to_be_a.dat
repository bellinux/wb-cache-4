5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Vibe, Beyoncé explained that the concept for the video in depth after being questioned as an [...] "everyday woman." [...] "I don't sing any of the song. The whole time it's like a silent movie and I'm being myself. I'm not performing. I reveal a side of myself no one's ever seen. I'm silly and goofy and not...trying to be a diva, or <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> star – just me." [...] The video features {{a black and white}} theme and a grainy film texture.

It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song." ...|$|E

In an interview with Orlando Sentinel about the series, New York Police Department Detective Ted Sica said Jeffries' wardrobe was too revealing for a detective, and that the real-life department would not allow her tank tops and tight vests: [...] "We don't tolerate that, especially in a sex crimes unit.

500|$|Despite {{his early}} promise, Moore's {{parents had been}} against him {{training}} as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became {{a teacher at the}} school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, [...] "for me the war passed in a romantic haze of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hero." [...] This attitude changed as he reflected on the destructiveness of war and in 1940 he wrote, {{in a letter to his}} friend Arthur Sale, that [...] "a year or two after [...] the sight of a khaki uniform began to mean everything in life that was wrong and wasteful and anti-life.

500|$|Kikuta finds {{composing}} {{music to}} be natural, [...] "like breathing". He considers {{it to be}} his [...] "vocation", and contrasts it with designing and creating video games, which he calls his [...] "wish" [...] and finds {{to be very difficult}} to do in comparison to composition. Kikuta does not worry about the style of music that he composes, considering it to only be a tool or method. As a result, his music is frequently composed of combinations of styles mixed together. He is inspired to create his music by things that he has seen, especially while traveling; he credits much of the musical imagery in Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 as being inspired by several islands in Fiji he has visited. Rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "pure artist" [...] that creates art for art's sake, Kikuta says that his primary goal in composing is to entertain the listeners. He has not been influenced by other video game composers, though he claims to admire Hitoshi Sakimoto, whom he worked with at Square. He has named Pink Floyd as his single biggest musical influence, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth as the artist he would most like to collaborate with. Kikuta's favorite song that he has composed is [...] "Overture" [...] from Concerto Gate.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has also}} been an issue with {{minority}} populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of [...] "Acting White." [...] It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, [...] "There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders." [...] Therefore, not only are there economic and prehistoric causes of racial educational segregation, {{but there are also}} social notions that continue to be obstacles to be overcome before minority groups can achieve success in education.|$|E
2500|$|... "Sound of the Underground", {{which opens}} the album, drew {{comparisons}} to Fatboy Slim.

[...] "Sound of the Underground" [...] was further described as [...] "a mechanistic sashay of twangy surf guitar and sultry gang vocals – Girls Aloud explodes like a five-headed Kylie Minogue." [...] "No Good Advice" [...] was labelled [...] "a disco track with guitar – a cross between Blondie and The Bangles." [...] Unlike many other songs, it {{was said to be}} [...] "not obsessed with <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together" [...] that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. [...] "Some Kind of Miracle", which is [...] "a breezy summer pop song about trying to bag a guy", follows. The Xenomania production had [...] "layered vocals with its slow tempo despite being more formulaic."

2500|$|With Jacobs {{assuming}} vocal duties, Larson on bass {{guitar and}} Terry on trumpet, the trio recruited several more musician friends from other local bands {{to piece together}} a full ensemble. Each member of the original line-up had musical backgrounds in various genres, including ska, punk, surf and new wave, all elements which were incorporated into the band's music and aesthetic: for example, the name [...] "The Aquabats" [...] was created {{to sound like a}} classic surf band, while a shared admiration of Devo inspired the idea of matching costumes. Jacobs simply recalled in a 2013 interview, [...] "We wanted to combine Devo with surf music and ska". Rehearsing only once in a house Jacobs and Larson shared at the time, The Aquabats played their first show a mere week after forming at a house party in August 1994. Larson remembered this show as merely [...] "a joke...we weren't <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> band. We were trying to have fun". Nevertheless, encouraged by a positive audience reception, The Aquabats started performing more local shows, soon becoming familiar faces within the Orange County underground.|$|E
