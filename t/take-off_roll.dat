25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{began its}} take-off from Los Angeles International Airport at approximately 9:25am. During that <b>take-off</b> <b>roll,</b> the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire {{on the left}} main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out.|$|E
500|$|On 28 May 2012, Vulcan B.2 XH558 {{suffered}} {{failure of}} the two port engines while starting a <b>take-off</b> <b>roll</b> from Robin Hood airport, Doncaster, UK. [...] Bags of silica gel desiccant were inadvertently left in the air intake after maintenance. Less than a second after increasing power from 80% to 100% these were ingested {{by one of the}} port engines, immediately destroying it. The remaining port engine ingested debris from the first engine, destroying this one as well. The fire prevention systems proved effective, neither the airframe nor control systems suffered damage. The pilot had no difficulty bringing the aircraft to a safe stop, having remained on the ground throughout. On 3 July 2012, XH558 returned to flight.|$|E
2500|$|The Airport Hotel is {{a public}} house {{operated}} by Robinson's Brewery and is on Ringway Road about [...] from the airport.

50|$|The semi-span {{wing flaps}} are of slotted design and are {{effective}} in all flight regimes.The 15 degrees ‘Take-Off’ position assists with early rising of the tail and main wheel lift off, thus reducing <b>take-off</b> ground <b>roll</b> significantly. At a hopper payload of 1050 kg the ground roll has been measured at approximately 420 metres (1380 ft) with zero wind and 15 degrees Celsius at sea level.|$|R
40|$|Various {{methods of}} {{providing}} runway {{information in the}} cockpit during the <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>roll</b> have been proposed. The most reliable method has been to use runway distance markers when visible.

The results of these tests indicate that a weak radioactive source would provide a reliable signal by which this indicator could be operated...|$|R
500|$|Kaga, like Akagi, was {{completed}} with three superimposed flight decks, the only carriers {{ever to be}} designed so. The British carriers converted from [...] "large light cruisers", , , and , each had two flight decks, {{but there is no}} evidence that the Japanese copied the British model. It is more likely that it was a case of convergent evolution to improve launch and recovery cycle flexibility by allowing simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. Kagas main flight deck was [...] long, her middle flight deck was only about [...] long and started in front of the bridge, and her lower flight deck was approximately [...] long. The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some of the lightly loaded aircraft could use it, even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than they were during World War II. At any rate the ever-increasing growth in aircraft performance, size and weight during the 1930s meant that even the bottom flight deck was no longer able to accommodate the <b>take-off</b> <b>roll</b> required for the new generations of aircraft being fielded and it was plated over when the ship was modernized in the mid-1930s. [...] Kagas main flight deck was completely flat until a conning tower was added during the modernization.|$|E

50|$|The Aero A.42 was a Czechoslovakian bomber {{aircraft}} of 1929 {{that was}} only ever produced in prototype form. For its day, it was an advanced design, with a sleek monoplane configuration. However, the Czech Air Force was not satisfied with it {{for a number of}} reasons. In particular, the aircraft's <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>rolls</b> were felt to be excessively long, and crew complained about the cramped cabin. The air force suggested a set of modifications to Aero, including replacing the wooden wing with a metal one, but Aero discontinued development.|$|R
5000|$|By {{combining}} the quaternion {{representations of the}} Euler rotations we get for the Body 3-2-1 sequence, where the airplane first does yaw (Body-Z) turn during taxiing onto the runway, then pitches (Body-Y) during <b>take-off,</b> and finally <b>rolls</b> (Body-X) in the air. The resulting orientation of Body 3-2-1 sequence (around the capitalized axis in the illustration of Tait-Bryan angles) is equivalent to that of lab 1-2-3 sequence (around the lower-cased axis), where the airplane is rolled first (lab-x axis), and then nosed up around the horizontal lab-y axis, and finally rotated around the vertical lab-z axis (lB = lab2Body): ...|$|R
25|$|Surfing can {{be broken}} into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out {{requires}} strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (duck diving, eskimo <b>roll).</b> <b>Take-off</b> positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly {{as soon as the}} wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking. Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a Balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art.|$|R
2500|$|Ground {{handling}} requires certain {{attention and}} procedures. The rear engine tends to overheat and can quit while taxiing on very hot days. Accidents have occurred when pilots, {{unaware of the}} shutdown, have attempted take-off on the nose engine alone, though the single-engine <b>take-off</b> <b>roll</b> exceeded the particular runway length. Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Directive 77-08-05 prohibits single-engine take-offs and requires the installation of a placard marked [...] "DO NOT INITIATE SINGLE ENGINE TAKEOFF".|$|E
2500|$|The DC-8 {{began its}} <b>take-off</b> <b>roll</b> on runway 22 from the {{intersection}} of runway 13 at 10:15 UTC (06:45 NST). It rotated near taxiway A, 51 seconds after brake release, at an airspeed of about 167 KIAS. Witnesses reported the aircraft showed difficulty gaining altitude after rotation. Airborne, the airspeed reached 172 KIAS and began to decrease again, causing the DC-8 to descend. After crossing the Trans-Canada Highway, located about [...] from the departure end of runway 22, at a very low altitude, the aircraft's pitch increased and it continued to descend.|$|E
2500|$|The {{procedure}} {{allows the}} receiving aircraft to remain airborne longer, extending its range or loiter time on station. [...] A series of air refuelings can give range {{limited only by}} crew fatigue and engineering factors such as engine oil consumption. [...] Because the receiver aircraft can be topped up with extra fuel in the air, air refueling can allow a takeoff with a greater payload which could be weapons, cargo, or personnel: the maximum takeoff weight is maintained by carrying less fuel and topping up once airborne. [...] Alternatively, a shorter <b>take-off</b> <b>roll</b> can be achieved because take-off can be at a lighter weight before refueling once airborne. Aerial refueling has also been considered {{as a means to}} reduce fuel consumption on long-distance flights greater than [...] Potential fuel savings in the range of 35-40% have been estimated for long haul flights (including the fuel used during the tanker missions).|$|E
50|$|It was {{intended}} {{from the outset}} {{that all of the}} Graf Zeppelins aircraft would normally launch via catapult. <b>Rolling</b> <b>take-offs</b> would be performed only in an emergency or if the catapults were inoperable due to battle damage or mechanical failure. Whether this practice would have been strictly adhered to or later modified, based on actual air trials and combat experience is open to question, especially given the limited capacity of the air reservoirs and the long recharging times necessary between launches. One advantage of such a system, however, was that the Graf Zeppelins could have launched their aircraft without need for turning the ship into the wind or under conditions where the prevailing winds were too light to provide enough lift for her heavier aircraft. They could also have launched and landed aircraft simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|A powered {{parachute}} often abbreviated PPC {{and also}} called a motorised parachute or paraplane {{is a type}} of aircraft that consists of a parachute with a motor and wheels. The aircraft's airspeed is typically about 25-35 mph (40-60 km/h). PPCs operate safely at heights ranging from a few feet off the ground (while ground skimming, a popular use of the aircraft) to altitudes as high as 10,000+ feet (5.5 km). But typical operating heights are between 500 and 1500 feet (150-500 meters). Equipped with the standard 5 or 10 gallon fuel tank, PPCs can typically be flown for about three hours. They have very short <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>rolls,</b> sometimes less than 100 ft (30 m). PPCs are among the least expensive aerial vehicles. A new one-person powered parachute may cost as little as $5,000, though double-seaters more typically cost about $10,000. Top end two-seater PPCs usually cost $15,000-$25,000. Empty weight is typically around 200-300 lb (90-135 kg) and payload can be upwards of 500 lb (225 kg). In the United States, most single place PPCs are flown under part 103 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and, therefore, may be flown without a license or flight instruction. Flight instruction is, however, highly recommended, and an average student can learn to fly a PPC safely with 5 to 10 hours of flight instruction. Two-seat PPCs are light sport aircraft in the United States. The pilot must have at least a sport pilot certificate issued by the FAA to fly them. A minimum of 10 hours of flight instruction, and 2 hours of solo as a student pilot, is required to obtain this certificate. Powered parachuting is {{not to be confused with}} powered paragliding.|$|R
