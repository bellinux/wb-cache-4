40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether zeolites of different size (Y 30 (nano-sized) and H-Beta(OH) -III (forming large aggregates/agglomerates composed of 50 nm small primary particles)) exerted acute toxicity on larvae of the non-biting midge, Chironomus riparius, and whether such zeolites {{are able to}} modulate the toxicity of a common insecticide, <b>thiacloprid,</b> by means of adsorption of a dissolved toxicant. We conducted acute toxicity tests with fourth instar larvae of C. riparius. In these tests, larvae were exposed to zeolites or <b>thiacloprid</b> solely, or to mixtures of both compounds. The mixtures comprised 1. 0 µg/L <b>thiacloprid</b> in addition to low (5. 2 mg/L), medium (18. 2  mg/L), and high (391. 7  mg/L) zeolite concentrations, resulting in different adsorption rates of <b>thiacloprid.</b> As biological endpoints, changes in mortality rates and in behavior were monitored every 24 h over a total investigation period of 96 h. Furthermore, we conducted chemical analyses of <b>thiacloprid</b> in the medium and the larvae and located the zeolite particles within the larvae by LA-ICP-MS imaging techniques. Our results demonstrate that both types of zeolites did not exert acute toxicity when applied as single-substances, but led to reduced acute toxicity of <b>thiacloprid</b> when applied together with <b>thiacloprid.</b> These results {{are in line with}} the sorption properties of zeolites indicating reduced bioavailability of <b>thiacloprid,</b> although our data indicate that <b>thiacloprid</b> can desorb from zeolites to some extent. While freely dissolved (i. e., non-sorbed) fraction of <b>thiacloprid</b> was a good parameter to roughly estimate toxic effects, it did not correlate with measured internal <b>thiacloprid</b> concentrations. Moreover, it was shown that both zeolite types were ingested by the larvae, but no indication for cellular uptake of them was found...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Living {{organisms are}} usually exposed to {{combinations}} {{of a number}} of physical and chemical environmental factors in their natural habitats. Pre-exposure to sub lethal doses of a chemical may induce enhanced tolerance to higher doses of the chemical during successive exposures. Pre-exposure may also make organisms more sensitive to later exposures to smaller doses of the chemical. Toxicity of chemicals is also significantly affected by physical environmental variables. Temperature is among the most important physical environmental factor that interact with toxic chemical substances affecting their toxicity. Due to these interactions, results from controlled laboratory experiments that consider a single factor cannot represent the true effect of the toxicant on an organism in its natural environment. Hence, for better safety recommendations, environmental risk assessment of toxic chemicals should consider as much environmental factors as possible. This study evaluates toxicity of <b>thiacloprid</b> to F. candida under two conditions. The first experiment evaluates toxicity of <b>thiacloprid</b> following pre-exposure (acclimation) to sub lethal concentration of the chemical. The second experiment assesses development of cross tolerance by F. candida to <b>thiacloprid</b> when combined with cold stress. In the pre-acclimation experiment, F. candida were exposed to sub lethal doses for two weeks before they are subject to higher doses. The cross tolerance experiments on the other hand evaluate toxicity of <b>thiacloprid</b> when combined with cold stress. The experiments were conducted by combining the two stress factors in three different orders (1. Cold and <b>thiacloprid</b> applied simultaneously, 2. <b>Thiacloprid</b> prior to cold, 3. Cold prior to <b>thiacloprid).</b> Pre-exposure had significantly reduced range of tolerance of F. candida to <b>thiacloprid.</b> ANOVA showed that pre-exposure reduced the concentration that kill 50 % of the population by a factor of five. Reproduction was also significantly reduced following pre-exposure. On the other experiment, cold stress and <b>thiacloprid</b> did not show development of cross tolerance. However, results from simultaneous exposure indicate that cold temperatures reduced toxicity of <b>thiacloprid.</b> Acute LC 50 of <b>thiacloprid</b> during simultaneous exposure was 7 times less at 7 0 C than the LC 50 at 15 0 C. However, cold stress applied either prior or following to <b>thiacloprid</b> did not show any effect on toxicity of <b>thiacloprid.</b> Adverse effect of thiacolprid on reproduction of F. candiad was also significantly aggravated by pre-exposure and cold stress...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{interactions}} between nanoparticles and a pesticide. The {{aim was to}} investigate how nano-sized aluminum oxide (410 nm) can alter the toxic effects of <b>thiacloprid,</b> even if no sorption between particles and the insecticide takes place. Thus, our study investigated a rather unexplored interaction. We conducted our research with larvae of Chironomus riparius and used <b>thiacloprid</b> as test substance as its toxicity to C. riparius is well described. The used nano-Al 2 O 3 particles where chosen due to their suitable properties. For testing the acute effects of the interaction, we exposed larvae to <b>thiacloprid</b> (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 5. 0 μg/L) and nano-Al 2 O 3 (300 and 1000 mg/L), either solely or in binary mixtures. While <b>thiacloprid</b> resulted in elevated mortality, nano-Al 2 O 3 solely did not exert any effects. Moreover, we observed an aggregation of nano-Al 2 O 3 within the lumen of the intestinal tract of the larvae. Further results showed a significantly reduced mortality of fourth instar larvae when they were exposed to mixtures of nanoparticles and the pesticide, compared to <b>thiacloprid</b> alone. With increasing nano-Al 2 O 3 concentration, this effect became gradually stronger. Additionally, chemical analyses of internal <b>thiacloprid</b> concentrations implicate reduced uptake of <b>thiacloprid</b> in animals exposed to mixtures. However, as larvae exposed to <b>thiacloprid</b> concentrations > 0. 5 μg/L showed severe convulsions, independent of the presence or concentration of nano-Al 2 O 3, we assume that nano-Al 2 O 3 leads to a delay of mortality and does not entirely prevent it. As sorption measurements on pristine or defecated nano-Al 2 O 3 did not reveal any sorptive interaction with <b>thiacloprid,</b> we can exclude sorption-based reduction of <b>thiacloprid</b> bioavailability as a mechanism behind our results. Even though we used test substances which might not co-occur in the environment in the tested concentrations, our study gives evidence for an interaction besides adsorption, which is important to generally understand how nanoparticles might affect biota...|$|E

In comparision with untreated controls, 10 ng mL- 1 <b>thiacloprid</b> perturbed the chemosensory ability of C. elegans such that the nematodes no longer demonstrated positive chemotaxis towards a NaCl chemo-attractant, reducing their chemotaxis index from + 0. 48 to near to zero.

40|$|Background: The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is {{undergoing}} a worldwide decline whose origin is still in debate. Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our {{study was designed to}} explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and <b>thiacloprid.</b> Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to <b>thiacloprid,</b> (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p. i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p. i. to <b>thiacloprid.</b> Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and <b>thiacloprid</b> had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p. i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7 -ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or <b>thiacloprid</b> a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system. These data support the hypothesis that the combination of the increasing prevalence of N. ceranae with high pesticide content in beehives may contribute to colony depopulatio...|$|E
40|$|Neonicotinoide gehören zu den wichtigsten Pestiziden, die zum Schutz von landwirtschaftlichen Kulturen eingesetzt werden. Aufgrund der weit verbreiteten Anwendung können Honigbienen mit diesen Substanzen in Berührung kommen. Ein möglicher Expositionsweg stellt das Guttationswasser von saatgutbehandelten Pflanzen dar, welches im ersten Teil der Untersuchungen dieser Diplomarbeit anhand von Proben neonicotinoid-gebeizter Maispflanzen mittels LC-MS/MS analysiert wurde. Die untersuchten Neonicotinoide Clothianidin, Imidacloprid und Thiamethoxam konnten im Guttationswasser in Konzentrationen im ppm-Bereich nachgewiesen werden. Als Folge einer möglichen Exposition von Honigbienen gegenüber Neonicotinoiden könnten diese Substanzen in den Honig gelangen, welcher vom Konsumenten als ein besonders reines Lebensmittel angesehen wird. In diesem Zusammenhang war das Hauptziel dieser Diplomarbeit die Entwicklung und Validierung einer analytischen Methode für die simultane Bestimmung von Neonicotinoiden in Honig sowie die anschließende Untersuchung von österreichischen Honig- und Nektarproben. Die Methode umfasste insgesamt acht Neonicotinoide (Acetamiprid, Clothianidin, Dinotefuran, Flonicamid, Imidacloprid, Nitenpyram, <b>Thiacloprid</b> und Thiamethoxam) und vier Metabolite (IM 2 - 1, TFNA-AM, TZMU und TZNG). Die Probenaufarbeitung basierte auf einer Extraktion mit Acetonitril und anschließender Aufreinigung mittels dispersiver Festphasenextraktion. Der Nachweis und die Quantifizierung der Analyte erfolgte mit LC-MS/MS. Drei Neonicotinoide konnten in den Honigproben nachgewiesen werden: 18 von 41 Proben enthielten <b>Thiacloprid,</b> zwei Proben Acetamiprid und eine Probe Spuren von Thiamethoxam. In Honigproben von Bienenvölkern, welche von Bienenverlusten betroffen waren, konnte <b>Thiacloprid</b> häufiger und in höheren Konzentrationen nachgewiesen werden als in normalen Monitoringproben.

Neun von elf Nektarproben enthielten ebenfalls <b>Thiacloprid.</b> Eine Korrelation zwischen den positiven Proben und Gebieten mit hohem Anteil an Mais- und Rapsanbau konnte nicht festgestellt werden. Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} {{belong to}} the most important pesticides in the protection of agricultural crops. Honeybees may {{come into contact with}} them as a consequence of their wide-spread application. The first matter of investigation of this thesis dealt with a possible exposure route of honeybees towards neonicotinoid insecticides, focusing on the detection and quantification of neonicotinoids in the guttation liquid of maize plants cultivated from neonicotinoid-treated seeds using LC-MS/MS. The investigated neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were detectable in the guttation liquid in considerable quantities in the ppm range. In the context of the possible exposure of honeybees to neonicotinoid insecticides these pesticides might be transferred into honey which represents a food with very high purity demands by consumers. In this context the main objective of this thesis was the development and validation of an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of neonicotinoid insecticides in honey and the subsequent analysis of Austrian honey and nectar samples. A total of eight neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, flonicamid, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, <b>thiacloprid</b> and thiamethoxam) and four metabolites (IM 2 - 1, TFNA-AM, TZMU and TZNG) were included in the multi-residue method. The final method involved a sample preparation procedure based on acetonitrile extraction and subsequent clean-up by dispersive solid-phase extraction followed by detection and quantification using LC-MS/MS. Three neonicotinoid insecticides were detectable in the analysed honey samples: 18 out of 41 samples contained <b>thiacloprid,</b> two samples acetamiprid and one sample traces of thiamethoxam.

Alternatively, the EMS proposed to extrapolate four outdoor residue trials data on open leaf lettuce to spinach and beet leaves only. Although this extrapolation is not explicitly mentioned in the European guidance document, EFSA is of the opinion that the proposal is acceptable, considering the morphological similarities between spinach/beet leaves and open leave varieties of lettuce and taking into account that spinach and beet leaves are minor crops. Thus, a MRL proposal of 0. 15 mg/kg is derived. Based on the risk assessment results EFSA concludes that the intended use of <b>thiacloprid</b> on spinach and beet leaves will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E
40|$|Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} target insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Their {{widespread use}} and possible risks to pollinators make it extremely urgent {{to understand the}} mech-anisms underlying their actions on insect nAChRs. We therefore elucidated X-ray crystal structures of the Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine binding protein (Ls-AChBP) and its Gln 55 Arg mutant, more closely resembling insect nAChRs, in complex with a nitro-methylene imidacloprid analog (CH-IMI) and desnitro-imidacloprid metabolite (DN-IMI) as well as commercial neonicotinoids, imidacloprid, clothianidin, and <b>thiacloprid.</b> Unlike imidacloprid, clothianidin, and CH-IMI, <b>thiacloprid</b> did not stack with Tyr 185 in the wild-type Ls-AChBP, but did in the Gln 55 Arg mutant, interacting electrostatically with Arg 55. In contrast, DN-IMI lacking the NO 2 group was directed away from Lys 34 and Arg 55 t...|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} method was {{developed}} for assessing ovicidal effects of the organophosphate azinphos-methyl, the neonicotioids <b>thiacloprid,</b> thiamethoxam and clothianidin, the oxadiazine indoxacarb and the insect growth regulators novaluron and pyriproxifen on the plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The baseline survivorship of this method was 88 percent. Plum curculio eggs were most sensitive to azinphos-methyl. <b>Thiacloprid,</b> clothianidin and the chitin synthesis inhibitor, novaluron, had LC 50 values below 100 ppm. Thiamethoxam, indoxacarb and pyriproxifen were not ovicidal at 100 ppm. Octanol-water partitioning coefficients, log Kow, {{appeared to be an}} important indicator of ovicidal activity within the neonicotinoids. This new bioassay method eliminates the confounding of the insect-chemical and plant-chemical interactions and the results highlight the utility of a post-infestation curative approach to plum curculio management...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} field trials {{were carried out}} from 2000 to 2003. Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} applied as seed potato treatments at planting were tested to control wireworms in potato crops. Compounds were applied as drench or spray. Neonicotinoids tested were imidacloprid at rates of 35, 70, 88, and 175 g a. i.; thiamethoxam at 17. 5, 35, 50, 70, and 140 g a. i.; and <b>thiacloprid</b> at 72 and 144 g a. i. per metric ton seed potatoes. Treatment with imidacloprid at 70 g/ton seed and thiamethoxam at 50 g/ton seed showed significant control of wireworms at harvest but <b>thiacloprid</b> showed insufficient protection.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the work}} was to develop an {{analytical}} procedure able to quantify traces of 13 neonicotinoids and pyrethroids as well as carboxamide in beeswax at low levels (ng g(- 1)) to evaluate the contamination. For this purpose, an efficient sample preparation procedure was developed based on solid-liquid extraction using dispersive diatomaceous earth and acetonitrile. This step {{was followed by a}} selective and sensitive analysis based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). This analytical procedure was validated based on International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The limits of quantification ranged from 1 ngg(- 1) (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, <b>thiacloprid</b> and boscalid) to 40 ngg(- 1) (lambda-cyhalothrin). The method was then successfully applied to 60 samples of beeswax collected in several areas of France.

40|$|This work aims to {{find out}} the {{presence}} of the resistant population (sub-population) of cabbage seedpod weevil. The collection of beetles took place from April to July in the years 2013 - 2014 all over the Czech Republic.

Both active substances were tested in 21 locations. The methodics of the IRAC organization was followed in the tests. It was found that the active substances lambda-cyhalotrin had 100 % efficiency in both years, while Biscaya 240 OD (active substance <b>thiacloprid)</b> had reduced efficiency in the year 2013 - between 93 and 100 %.

40|$|Complex {{mixtures}} {{makes the}} assessment of environmental hazards difficult due to possible antagonistic or synergistic interactions that can occur between chemicals, or even more complex effect patterns like dose-level or dose-ratio dependent responses. The aim of the present work {{was to investigate the}} acute and sublethal responses of Daphnia magna Straus exposed to four single chemical compounds (imidacloprid, <b>thiacloprid,</b> nickel chloride, and chlorpyrifos) and three binary chemical mixtures. In the immobilization and feeding inhibition bioassays, chlorpyrifos was the most toxic to D. magna, followed by nickel chloride, and imidacloprid and <b>thiacloprid,</b> which showed similar levels of toxicity. The MIXTOX was used to evaluate mixture toxicity. Observed data was compared with the expected mixture effects predicted by concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models; deviations for synergistic/antagonistic interactions, dose-level and dose-ratio dependency were also used. In the mixture toxicity assessment, several patterns of response were obtained depending on the mixture but also on the endpoint tested. For imidacloprid and <b>thiacloprid,</b> deviations for synergism were observed in acute exposures (immobilization), and antagonism for feeding rates at sublethal concentrations. For imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos, antagonism was found in both exposures. In the nickel and chlorpyrifos case study, deviations for synergism were observed in the acute exposure; a dose-ratio deviation was observed in the feeding inhibition test, with a pattern for antagonism, except for where nickel exerts more than 60 % of the mixture toxicity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{there are}} still no {{confirmed}} reports of strong resistance to neonicotinoid. insecticides in aphids, the peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer) shows variation in response, with some clones exhibiting up to tenfold resistance to imidacloprid. Five clones varying in response to imidacloprid were tested with four other neonicotinoid molecules to investigate the extent of cross-resistance. RESULTS: All four compounds-thiarnethoxam, <b>thiacloprid,</b> clothianidin and dinotefuran-were cross-resisted, with ED 50 values ranked {{in the same order}} as for imidacloprid. Resistance factors ranged up to 11 for imidacloprid, 18 for thiamethoxam, 13 for <b>thiacloprid,</b> 100 for clothianidin and 6 for dinotefuran. CONCLUSION: This variation in response {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to compromise the field performance of neonicotinoids aimed at controlling aphids. However, it highlights the need for careful vigilance and stewardship in all M. persicae populations, and a need to consider neonicotinoids as a single cross-resisted group for management purposes.

40|$|The {{environment}} is constantly {{exposed to a}} cocktail of contaminants mainly due to human activities. Because polluted ecosystems are characterized by an amalgam of chemical compounds, {{the objective of the}} present study was to assess the joint effect of chemical mixtures to the life history traits of Daphnia magna Straus. For that a binary mixture of two neonicotinoid insecticides, imidacloprid and <b>thiacloprid,</b> and another one of imidacloprid with nickel chloride were tested. Theoretical models have been developed and applied in studies with chemical mixtures, predicting toxicity based on their modes of action: concentration addition (CA) and independent joint action (IA) models. Still there are cases where deviations are observed (e. g. synergistic or antagonistic behaviors, dose ratio or level dependency). In this study, the effects of the individual compounds and their mixtures were studied in a chronic test where reproduction, survival and body length were evaluated in D. magna. Regarding single compound effects, it was observed that the most toxic was nickel chloride followed by <b>thiacloprid</b> and imidacloprid. For the mixture exposure of imidacloprid and <b>thiacloprid,</b> a synergistic pattern was observed in the sublethal doses used for the number of neonates produced, while for the body length the best fit was shown with the CA model. In the mixture exposure of imidacloprid and nickel, no deviation from the IA was observed for the neonate production data; for the body length parameter, a synergistic pattern was observed in low doses of the chemicals while an antagonistic pattern was observed.

40|$|The {{hoverfly}} Episyrphus balteatus (Degeer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} abundant predators of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae (L.)) in brussels sprouts in Belgium. In the current laboratory study, the toxicity of several insecticides applied at maximum recommended field rates was investigated on the larvae of E. balteatus. Two-to 3 -day-old larvae were confined in glass petri dishes with dry residues of freshly applied insecticides. Their mortality was checked daily until adult emergence. Sub-lethal effects were investigated by assessing the reproductive performance of adult hoverflies, originating from the surviving larvae. Of the five compounds tested, only pirimicarb caused 100 % larval mortality. The corrected mortality for spinosad was 60 % and the adults obtained from the surviving larvae did not succeed in laying eggs. Therefore, pirimicarb and spinosad were rated "harmful" (International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC) category 4) for the larvae of E. balteatus. In contrast, flonicamid, <b>thiacloprid</b> and spirotetramat yielded much lower mortality percentages. The hatching rate of hoverfly eggs treated with flonicamid was 25. 6 % vs 48. 7 % in the control. Hence, flonicamid was rated "slightly harmful" (IOBC category 2). The fertility of adults treated as larvae with <b>thiacloprid</b> or spirotetramat was not affected (IOBC category 1). These laboratory trials suggest that <b>thiacloprid</b> and spirotetramat can be used safely in integrated pest management programs to control the cabbage aphid. Pirimicarb, spinosad and flonicamid should be tested in semi-field and field situations to assess their toxicity under more realistic conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMyzus persicae (Sulzer, 1776), a major {{crop pest}} worldwide, {{displays}} insecticide resistance to most molecules. The R 81 T substitution on the β 1 subunit of nicotinic receptors of acetylcholine (nAChR) confers target site resistance to neonicotinoids and is widespread in aphid populations colonizing peach tree orchards in Southern Europe. But {{the impact of}} this resistance in the field, as well as ways to optimize its management, depends largely on the dominance level of the R 81 T mutation. In this study, we measured by in vitro assays the response of R 81 T mutation to two neonicotinoids (imidacloprid and <b>thiacloprid)</b> in 23 M. persicae clones with different resistance genotypes in order to assess the dominance status of this allele. In this study, all homozygous clones for the R 81 T mutation (genotype 81 (TT)) showed a much higher level of resistance to both active substances than other clones. The heterozygous clones 81 (RT) displayed a slightly higher level of resistance than wild homozygous, though resistance phenotypes against both neonicotinoids in these two genotypes were overlapping. A great variation of resistance level was found within these two latter clones' categories. The dominance level of insecticide resistance (DLC) strongly suggested that the mutant allele 81 T is semirecessive (the wild 81 R allele being rather dominant) for both insecticide molecules under test. Mean DLC values were 0. 316 for imidacloprid and 0. 351 for <b>thiacloprid.</b> Cross-resistance was shown between imidacloprid and <b>thiacloprid.</b> This partial recessivity is valuable information to broaden the knowledge on neonicotinoid resistance, a prerequisite for devising adapted management strategies against insecticide-resistant populations of M. persicae...|$|E
40|$|Three neonicotinyl insecticides, acetamiprid, <b>thiacloprid</b> and clothianidin, were {{evaluated}} for {{their impact on}} four species of lepidopteran pests of apple in Washington, the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), the Pandemis leafroller, Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott, and the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), and Lacanobia subjuncta (Grote & Robinson). None of the neonicotinyl insecticides demonstrated sufficient activity against P. pyrusana, C. rosaceana, or L. subjuncta to warrant field trials. Conversely, all had some activity against one or more stages of C. pomonella. Acetamiprid was highly toxic to larvae in laboratory bioassays, and had relatively long activity of field-aged residues (21 days). It also showed some toxicity to C. pomonella eggs (via topical exposure) and adults. Acetamiprid provided {{the highest level of}} fruit protection from C. pomonella attack in field trials conducted over five years in experimental orchards with extremely high codling moth pressure. <b>Thiacloprid</b> performed similarly in bioassays, but fruit protection in field trials was slightly lower than acetamiprid. Clothianidin showed moderate to high toxicity in bioassays, depending on the C. pomonella stage tested, but poor fruit protection from attack in field trials. None of the neonicotinyl insecticides were as toxic to larvae or effective in protecting fruit as the current standard organophosphate insecticide used for C. pomonella control, azinphosmethyl. However, both acetamiprid and <b>thiacloprid</b> should provide acceptable levels of C. pomonella control in commercial orchards where densities are much lower than in the experimental orchards used for our trials.
