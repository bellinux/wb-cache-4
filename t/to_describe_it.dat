5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about {{for no apparent}} reason. In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that this Brownian motion {{was caused by the}} water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it.</b> This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook cinnamomina {{is found}} on Tepa and Babar Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It has {{cinnamon}} upperparts, brownish crown and cinnamon-streaked underparts.

5|$|In October 2014, {{after the}} usual video-game review outlets {{were unable to}} obtain early access to Shadow of Mordor, John Bain (known as TotalBiscuit) said that YouTube video creators had been offered early access in {{exchange}} for agreeing to a contract requiring them <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> positively. Jim Sterling of The Escapist obtained a copy {{of one of the}} contracts and analyzed it in detail. The Federal Trade Commission began an investigation and announced in July 2016 that Warner Brothers Home Entertainment had violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, and that the company must declare sponsored advertising in the future.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> as a radical revolution.|$|E
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} {{phenomena that}} electromagnetism describes {{have been studied}} as separate fields since antiquity. For example, there were many advances {{in the field of}} optics centuries before light was understood to be an electromagnetic wave. However, the theory of electromagnetism, as it is currently understood, grew out of Michael Faraday's experiments suggesting an electromagnetic field and James Clerk Maxwell's use of differential equations <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> in his A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873). For a detailed historical account, consult Pauli, Whittaker, Pais, and Hunt.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{does not}} have the units of angular {{momentum}} and is not a type of spin, the formalism that describes it is mathematically similar to that of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, which means it can be coupled in the same manner. For example, a proton-neutron pair can be coupled in a state of total isospin 1 or 0. It is a dimensionless quantity and the name derives {{from the fact that the}} mathematical structures used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> are very similar to those used to describe the intrinsic angular momentum (spin).|$|E
25|$|The 4th-century Mencius {{claims that}} the early Zhou {{developed}} the well-field system, a pattern of land occupation in which eight peasant families cultivated fields around a central plot that they farmed for a lord. Modern historians have generally doubted {{the existence of this}} idealised system, but some maintain that it may have existed informally in the early Zhou, when dependent tenants working on manorial estates paid corvée to their landlords instead of rent, as they would later. Many Chinese historians continue <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> as historical.|$|E
50|$|The {{momentum}} {{representation of}} a wave function is very {{closely related to the}} Fourier transform and the concept of frequency domain. Since a quantum mechanical particle has a frequency proportional to the momentum (de Broglie's equation given above), describing the particle as a sum of its momentum components is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as a sum of frequency components (i.e. a Fourier transform). This becomes clear when we ask ourselves how we can transform from one representation to another.|$|R

25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it.</b> That is enough under the law to allow a court to consider such activity harmful to a child. To declare that homosexuality is harmful {{is not to make}} new law but to reaffirm the old; {{to say that it is}} not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{psychology}} also studies animal behaviour, but, {{as opposed}} to ethology, is construed as a sub-topic of psychology rather than as one of biology. Historically, where comparative psychology has included research on animal behaviour {{in the context of}} what is known about human psychology, ethology involves research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about animal anatomy, physiology, neurobiology, and phylogenetic history. Furthermore, early comparative psychologists concentrated on the study of learning and tended to research behaviour in artificial situations, whereas early ethologists concentrated on behaviour in natural situations, tending <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> as instinctive.|$|E
25|$|Vectors play an {{important}} role in physics: the velocity and acceleration of a moving object and the forces acting on it can all be described with vectors. Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances (except, for example, position or displacement), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the coordinate system used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>it.</b> Other vector-like objects that describe physical quantities and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include pseudovectors and tensors.|$|E
