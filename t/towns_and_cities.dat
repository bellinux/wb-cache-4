5|$|The {{siege of}} the Godesburg and its {{subsequent}} destruction were a mere taste {{of things to}} come. It {{was the first of}} many sieges in the Cologne War, and the castle's fall eventually led to the fall not just of Bonn, but of several other principal <b>towns</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> in the Electorate of Cologne: Hülchrath, Neuss and Werl. Several smaller fortified towns such as Gelsenkirchen, Unkel and Brühl were also either heavily damaged or destroyed before, during and after the siege. In addition to damage to the <b>towns</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities,</b> Ernst's supporters managed to restrict imports and exports to and from the Electorate, not only crippling Gebhard's financial resources but resulting in economic hardship for the inhabitants.|$|E
