5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is {{the third}} entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of 2D {{fighting}} games. The game utilizes similar tag team-based game mechanics to its predecessor, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. Before starting each match, the player selects a team of two fighters to compete in one-on-one combat. The player is free to swap between their characters at any point during battle. While one character fights, their teammate resting off-screen slowly regenerates their life gauge. The first team <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> their opponent's vitality wins the match; however, if the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is {{an updated}} version of , an arcade-style {{fighting}} game, and changes little from the basic gameplay of the original. Players select teams of three different characters to engage in one-on-one combat. The game utilizes the same tag team-based fighting mechanics as its predecessors; players may choose to swap between their characters at any point during a match. Players must use the various attacks in their arsenal, such as character assists, special moves, and hyper combos, <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> their opponent's life gauge and defeat the entire enemy team, or have the most cumulative health when time runs out. While the core mechanics remain the same, a number of aesthetic changes have been made in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, with a stronger emphasis on the comic book motif. The HUD, character selection, and stage selection screens have been redesigned. In addition, many returning characters receive balancing changes, which include new moves and animation tweaks.|$|E
5000|$|Import and {{exchange}} controls {{were introduced in}} response <b>to</b> <b>exhausting</b> sterling reserves.|$|R
5000|$|... 2004 models added a 2-way {{catalytic}} converter (for some markets) <b>to</b> the <b>exhaust</b> system, and minor modifications <b>to</b> the <b>exhaust</b> metalwork.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 {{he was on}} the Board of Directors for the Matawan Bank when {{it closed}} it doors due <b>to</b> <b>exhausting</b> its cash funds.|$|R
5|$|Enemies appear on-screen, and can {{be engaged}} by {{clicking}} on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly drawn from a deck of nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as it accumulates, but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up their cards to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired Treasure Trove is Power-type focused.|$|E
5|$|Rescuing Torahime {{from the}} spider demon Tsuchigumo, Kisuke learns that she died while fleeing from the shogun's forces, {{and that her}} present life is a {{temporary}} gift from Amitābha. The two travel to Mount Fuji, where its native dragon god has gone berserk with rage after Japan's ley line energy is diverted to Edo, forcing a route into Heaven. The true culprit is the dark deity imprisoned in the Kuzuryu, the mad god Inugami. Upon being confronted, the possessed Shogun Tsunayoshi fatally wounds Torahime, who dies in Kisuke's arms: Kisuke then defeats Tsunayoshi and takes possession of the Kuzuryu. In the first ending, after the battle, Kisuke asks Amitābha to return the now-enlightened Torahime to life, then commits suicide {{as an act of}} defiance when his demand is refused. Torahime asks for her and Kisuke to be reincarnated so she can help him attain enlightenment. In the second ending, Kisuke arrives to find Tsunayoshi killed by the Jinkuro-possessed Momohime. Kisuke exorcises Jinkuro, and following Torahime's final request becomes Momohime's servant. The two then set out on a personal quest to locate all the Demon Blades causing conflict in Japan. In the third ending, after his battle, Kisuke is sent back in time to the day he first betrayed his employers through the Oboro Muramasa's power. His warning allows Torahime to foil the plot against her family, then Kisiuke steals the Kuzuryu and sets off on a journey round the world <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> its power by striking down evil, promising to marry Torahime upon his return.|$|E
25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> any internal appeals procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|E
25|$|IRV {{elections}} {{that require a}} majority of cast ballots but not that voters rank all candidates may require {{more than a single}} IRV ballot due <b>to</b> <b>exhausted</b> ballots.|$|R
5000|$|A soldier {{finds the}} Duck and is granted the ducats. He is close <b>to</b> <b>exhausting</b> {{them when he}} gives a beggar his last penny. The Duck disappears, {{together}} with the whole Castle.|$|R
25|$|An {{emissions}} filter fitted <b>to</b> the <b>exhaust</b> pipe {{which turns}} {{out not to}} let anything through, causing the <b>exhaust</b> <b>to</b> come in the front.|$|R
25|$|The Court also {{concluded}} that the detainees are not required <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> review procedures {{in the court of}} appeals before seeking habeas relief in the district court.|$|E
25|$|For these drives, at {{the highest}} exhaust speeds, {{energetic}} efficiency and thrust are all inversely proportional <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> velocity. Their very high exhaust velocity means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{proposed}} advantage over Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Nakula, or Sahadeva with the gada, Duryodhana picks his nemesis Bhima. Despite Bhima's physical advantage, Duryodhana had the better technique {{due to his}} devotion to his craft. After a long and brutal battle between the two disciples of Balarama, Duryodhana begins <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> Bhima, and nearly makes Bhima faint.|$|E
25|$|About 35 State Emergency Service {{personnel}} from New South Wales and 20 {{personnel from}} Victoria were deployed to provide relief <b>to</b> <b>exhausted</b> staff and volunteers. A national appeal was established on 29 December, {{with the state}} and federal governments giving A$1million each.|$|R
50|$|The Garden had no air conditioning, {{resulting}} in fog forming over the ice during some Bruins' playoff games. During Game 5 of the 1984 NBA Finals, the 97 F {{heat in the}} facility was so intense that oxygen tanks were provided <b>to</b> <b>exhausted</b> players.|$|R
50|$|The lower {{crankshaft}} is timed 12 degrees {{before the}} upper crankshaft in order <b>to</b> expel <b>exhaust</b> gasses prior <b>to</b> the admittance of scavenging air. Fresh air cleanses the cylinders of remaining <b>exhaust</b> prior <b>to</b> the <b>exhaust</b> ports being {{covered by the}} rising lower piston.|$|R
25|$|A slow read attack sends {{legitimate}} {{application layer}} requests, but reads responses very slowly, thus trying <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> the server's connection pool. It {{is achieved by}} advertising {{a very small number}} for the TCP Receive Window size, {{and at the same time}} emptying clients' TCP receive buffer slowly, which causes a very low data flow rate.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{debated whether}} the Confederacy {{could have won}} the war. Most scholars, {{including}} James McPherson, argue that Confederate victory was at least possible. McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> the Union.|$|E
25|$|High {{emissions}}. As {{unburnt fuel}} {{is in the}} exhaust stream, emissions requirements are difficult to meet. This problem may be overcome by implementing direct fuel injection into the combustion chamber. The Freedom Motors Rotapower Wankel engine, which is not yet in production, met the ultra low California emissions standards. The Mazda Renesis engine, with both intake and exhaust side ports, suppressed the loss of unburned mix <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> formerly induced by port overlap.|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{approach}} develops physical-mathematical {{model of}} rocket engine exhaust cloud rise, growth, and diffusion. Analytic derivations and resultant model apply <b>to</b> hot <b>exhaust</b> cloud study or industrial stack plumes, making work results applicable to air pollution. Model formulations apply <b>to</b> all <b>exhaust</b> cloud types and various atmospheric conditions...|$|R
50|$|Concentrations are {{corrected}} <b>to</b> dry <b>exhaust</b> {{conditions with}} 15% residual O2.|$|R
5|$|The more marine species, such as petrels, auks and gannets, {{are more}} {{restricted}} in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants. This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds, but {{can happen in}} great numbers <b>to</b> <b>exhausted</b> adults after large storms, an event known as a wreck, where they provide prized sightings for birders.|$|R
25|$|Aggravating factors {{surround}} {{the demand for}} seafood from East Asian markets, which encourage commercial fishermen <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> stocks in Russia’s EEZ. Russian illegal exporters have well oiled links to importers in Japan, China and South Korea. Criminal groups and corruption magnifies the effect, as the short distances needed to transport seafood from south Kurils and south Sakhalin to Japan. Huge fish processing developments in China built on cheap labour encourage the export of further unprocessed fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} {{that followed the}} collapse of the armistice negotiation were some of the worst of 1952. The Battle of White Horse had crippled four regiments from the PVA 38th Corps, while Operation Showdown resulted in 11,500 Chinese casualties. Despite the heavy losses, the Chinese managed <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> the UN forces through two months of attrition warfare, and the United Nations Command soon renounced all major ground operations {{for the rest of the}} war. The front was stabilized once again by November 1952.|$|E
25|$|The Court also {{concluded}} that the detainees are not required <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> review procedures {{in the court of}} appeals before pursuing habeas corpus actions in the district court. The majority distinguished between de jure and de facto sovereignty, finding that the United States had in effect de facto sovereignty over Guantanamo. Distinguishing Guantanamo base from historical precedents, this conclusion allowed the court to conclude that Constitutional protections of habeas corpus run to the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.|$|E
50|$|Some smaller sized {{atmospheric}} tactical missiles, {{such as the}} AIM-9X Sidewinder, eschew {{flight control}} surfaces and instead use mechanical vanes <b>to</b> deflect motor <b>exhaust</b> <b>to</b> one side.|$|R
40|$|There are {{at least}} three {{mechanisms}} by which alveolar macrophages {{play a critical role in}} protecting the lung from bacterial or viral infections: production of inflammatory cytokines that recruit and activate lung phagocytes, production of antimicrobial reactive oxidant species, and production of interferon (an antiviral agent). In this article we summarize data concerning the effect of exposure <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> particles on these alveolar macrophage functions and the role of adsorbed organic chemicals compared to the carbonaceous core in the toxicity of diesel particles. In vitro exposure of rat alveolar macrophages <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> particles decreased the ability of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial product] to stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Methanol extract exhibited this potential but methanol-washed diesel particles did not. Exposure of rats <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> particles by intratracheal instillation also decreased LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL- 1 production from alveolar macrophages. In contrast, carbon black did not exhibit this inhibitory effect. Exposure of rats <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> particles by inhalation decreased the ability of alveolar macrophages to produce antimicrobial reactive oxidant species in response to zymosan (a fungal component). In contrast, exposure to coal dust increased zymosan-stimulated oxidant production. In vivo exposure <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> particles but not to carbon black decreased the ability of the lungs to clear bacteria. Inhalation exposure of mice <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> particles but not to coal dust depressed the ability of the lung to produce the antiviral agent interferon and increased viral multiplication in the lung. These results support the hypothesis that exposure <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> particles increases the susceptibility of the lung to infection by depressing the antimicrobial potential of alveolar macrophages. This inhibitory effect appears to be due to adsorbed organic chemicals rather than the carbonaceous core of the diesel particles...|$|R
5000|$|Health risks {{associated}} with rolling coal include respiratory issues. The American Cancer Society has linked exposure <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>to</b> lung cancer. [...] A more actionable concern is road traffic safety violations, as the black smoke can intentionally impair visibility, risking motor vehicle crashes.|$|R
25|$|On 18 May 1656 the French troops, {{commanded}} by Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne began {{to close in}} and surround the fortified town of Valenciennes which was defended by a Spanish garrison {{under the command of}} Francisco de Meneses. The well organised siege began <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> the defenders. Towards the end of June, Don Juan José de Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, took the decision to {{come to the aid of}} Valenciennes as its situation was becoming unsustainable.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} a trireme {{could cover}} {{in a given}} day depended much on the weather. On a good day, the oarsmen, rowing for 6–8 hours, could propel the ship between eighty and a hundred kilometres. There were rare instances however when experienced crews and new ships were able to cover nearly twice that distance (Thucydides mentions a trireme travelling 300 kilometres in one day). The commanders of the triremes also had to stay aware of the condition of their men. They had to keep their crews comfortably paced so as not <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> them before battle.|$|E
25|$|Simple attacks such as SYN floods {{may appear}} {{with a wide}} range of source IP addresses, giving the {{appearance}} of a well distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP three way handshake and attempt <b>to</b> <b>exhaust</b> the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as syn cookies may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding, however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement.|$|E
25|$|Clean School Bus USA is a {{national}} partnership to reduce children's exposure <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling, installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones. Its goal is to reduce both children's exposure <b>to</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> {{and the amount of}} air pollution created by diesel school buses.|$|R
50|$|Failures {{in cells}} can be {{life-threatening}} for technical divers and in particular, rebreather divers. The failure modes common to these cells are: failing {{with a higher}} than expected output due to electrolyte leaks, current limitation due <b>to</b> <b>exhausted</b> cell life and non linear output across its range. These failures are usually attributable to physical damage, contamination during manufacture or defects in manufacture.|$|R
