5|$|Powerball is {{a drawing}} {{game in which}} players try to match five numbers from 1 through 69, plus a Powerball number from 1 through 26. A ticket that matches all six numbers wins <b>the</b> <b>jackpot.</b> Jackpot amounts begin at $40 million and grow with each drawing in which <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> is not won. Top-prize Powerball winners can choose cash in lieu of annuity payments. <b>The</b> <b>jackpot</b> is pari-mutuel, meaning that if {{multiple}} tickets match all six numbers, each of them receives an equal share of the total jackpot.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. <b>The</b> <b>jackpot</b> started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim <b>the</b> <b>jackpot,</b> a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to <b>the</b> <b>jackpot,</b> regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, when no {{contestant}} had won $1 {{million in}} any show that aired {{over a period}} of five months, the top prize was then changed from a flat $1 million to an accumulating jackpot that increased by $10,000 for each episode where the top prize was not won. On April 10, 2001, Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the final question and won $2,180,000, making him the biggest winner in television history at the time. The top prize for correctly answering the final question returned to $1 million following Olmstead's win and has remained unchanged since; just five days after Olmstead's win, the standard $1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen. The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant, on the episode aired September 7, 2001; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31, 2001 when <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> was $1,860,000, where he was ruled to have answered his $16,000 question incorrectly, but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that question, Toutant was invited back and won the $1,860,000 jackpot. On the Super Millionaire spin-off, Robert Essig won $1,000,000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away, not reaching the final question for $10,000,000.|$|E

25|$|In bonusball lotteries {{where the}} bonus ball is compulsory, {{the odds are}} often even lower. In the Mega Millions multi-state lottery in the United States, 5 numbers are drawn {{from a group of}} 75 and 1 number is drawn from a group of 15, and a player must match all 6 balls to win <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> prize. The chance of winning <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> is 1 in 258,890,850.|$|E
25|$|Matching more numbers, the payout goes up. Although none {{of these}} {{additional}} prizes affect the chances of winning <b>the</b> <b>jackpot,</b> they do improve the odds of winning something and therefore add {{a little to the}} value of the ticket. On the other hand, multiple smaller prizes usually mean smaller jackpots. It is common for <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> to be split evenly if multiple players have tickets with all the winning numbers.|$|E

A Strike or Spare awarded $20. The real allure of the show was <b>the</b> <b>Jackpot,</b> which was awarded to any bowler who got two consecutive Strikes. <b>The</b> <b>jackpot</b> started at $200, $300, or $500 (depending on the version) and was increased by $20 each time it was not hit.|$|E
25|$|The odds {{of winning}} {{can also be}} reduced by {{increasing}} the group from which numbers are drawn. In the SuperEnalotto of Italy, players must match 6 numbers out of 90. The chance of winning <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> is 1 in 622,614,630.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} format meant that episodes of Now You See It {{were no longer}} {{self-contained}} and could straddle between episodes, and an episode could end with a game in progress {{that would have to}} be continued on the next program. Also, if a champion won <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> in the Solo Game and retired, the opponent he/she had defeated in the Championship Round came back to play again in the Championship Round of the following game.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, lottery {{winnings}} are {{not subject}} to personal income tax, so there are no tax consequences to consider in choosing a payment option.

In Liechtenstein, all winnings are tax-free and the winner may opt to receive a lump sum or an annuity with regard to <b>the</b> <b>Jackpot</b> prizes.|$|E
