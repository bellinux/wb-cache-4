5|$|Carter's story draws {{heavily on}} Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and {{particularly}} on James Whale's 1931 {{film version of}} the story. The script had been written specifically with singer Cher and actress Roseanne Barr in mind, but both were unavailable {{at the time of}} shooting. <b>Talk-show</b> <b>host</b> Jerry Springer appeared as himself, and Chris Owens—who appeared in later episodes as FBI agent Jeffrey Spender—played The Great Mutato. The episode was filmed in black-and-white, with a sky backdrop created to imitate the style of old Frankenstein films. Owens wore makeup and prosthetics that took several hours to apply.|$|E

He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles. He also declined director Martin Scorsese's offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film The King of Comedy, {{the role of a}} TV <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> then going to Jerry Lewis.|$|E
25|$|Badnarik {{was viewed}} as {{unlikely}} to win the Libertarian presidential nomination, facing challenges from <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> Gary Nolan and Hollywood producer Aaron Russo. At the 2004 Libertarian National Convention, Badnarik gained substantial support following the candidates' debate (broadcast live on C-SPAN). In the closest presidential nomination race in the Libertarian Party's 32-year history, all three candidates polled within 12 votes of {{each other on the}} first ballot (Russo 258, Badnarik 256, Nolan 246). When the second ballot placed the candidates in the same order, Gary Nolan was eliminated and threw his support to Badnarik; Badnarik won the nomination on the third ballot 417 to 348, with None of the Above receiving six votes. Richard Campagna of Iowa City, Iowa, was elected separately by convention delegates as his vice-presidential nominee.|$|E

500|$|Burke {{resigned}} in 1987, and Labor's Dr Ian Alexander, a City of Perth councillor and town planner from the party's left faction, won the subsequent by-election on 9 May 1987. He {{spent much of}} his parliamentary time on Aboriginal issues, sustainability and the environment and the Northern Suburbs Transit System project. On 4 March 1991, Ian Alexander resigned from the Labor party citing [...] "frequent breaches of the party's basic principles and platforms", and sat as an independent until the 1993 election. Dr Alexander did not stand for election in 1993, and Labor's Diana Warnock, a former radio <b>talk-show</b> <b>host,</b> won the seat with 50.29% of the two-party-preferred vote against the Liberals' Hal G.P. Colebatch.|$|E
500|$|Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{began working}} on the Bangladesh {{recordings}} on 2 August, and work continued there at the Record Plant for around a week. Spector later talked of them spending [...] "six months" [...] mixing {{what amounted to a}} total of four hours of music; in fact, the process took just over a month, as Harrison told <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> Dick Cavett that November. In their book Eight Arms to Hold You, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter question the extent of Spector's involvement, citing Harrison's subsequent lauding of Kellgren's role in [...] "capturing the performances" [...] on 1 August, as well as the fact that Spector was [...] "in and out of hospital" [...] during this time, similar to his erratic attendance at the All Things Must Pass sessions in 1970.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the start}} of the 21st century, and {{specifically}} during the late-2000s financial crisis, many politicians and pundits, such as Gordon Brown and Henry Kissinger, used the term [...] "new world order" [...] in their advocacy for a comprehensive reform of the global financial system and their calls for a [...] "New Bretton Woods" [...] taking into account emerging markets such as China and India. These declarations had the unintended consequence of providing fresh fodder for New World Order conspiracism, which culminated in <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> Sean Hannity stating on his Fox News Channel program Hannity that the [...] "conspiracy theorists were right". Progressive [...] media-watchdog groups have repeatedly criticized Fox News in general and its opinion show Glenn Beck in particular for not only mainstreaming the New World Order conspiracy theories of the radical right, but possibly agitating its lone wolves into action.|$|E

500|$|Also in January 1997, an {{open letter}} to then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared, {{published}} as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, drawing parallels between the [...] "organized oppression" [...] of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s. The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer Bertram Fields, whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry, including the top executives of MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie Hawn, director Oliver Stone, writers Mario Puzo and Gore Vidal and <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> Larry King. It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself, which until then had received scant notice, and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington.|$|E

[...] Emily Yahr of The Washington Post spoke positively of his acting, by saying [...] "Peeta's crazed expression is sure to haunt our nightmares for a long time," [...] while David Edelstein of New York criticized his portrayal in relation to scenes with the other characters, saying [...] "at least Josh Hutcherson's captured Peeta is mostly seen in interviews with Stanley Tucci's camp <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> on TV screens ... so the actor can't bring his lack of urgency to scenes with [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut" [...] {{was written}} by South Park co-creator Trey Parker and staff writer David R. Goodman, and {{directed}} by Parker. South Park would sometimes have guest appearances by celebrities, but they would usually voice a supporting or minor character; Academy Award winning actor George Clooney had previously provided dog barks for the episode [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". Comedian and <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> Jay Leno provided the sounds of Cartman's cat Mr. Kitty in the episode. Leno would return later as himself in the season two episode [...] "City on the Edge of Forever". Toddy Walters provided the vocals for the song used at [...] "The Drunken Barn Dance" [...] (which is a parody of [...] "My Heart Will Go On").

500|$|Her bosom {{was so much}} a part of {{her public}} persona that <b>talk-show</b> <b>host</b> Jack Paar once welcomed the actress to The Tonight Show by saying, [...] "Here they are, Jayne Mansfield", a line written for Paar by Dick Cavett that became the title of her {{biography}} by Raymond Strait. Joan Jacobs Brumberg describes the 1950s as [...] "an era distinguished by its worship of full-breasted women" [...] and attributes the paradigm shift to Mansfield and Monroe. Almost half a century after her death, a biographer of Nikolaus Pevsner (a German-born writer on British architecture), noted the improbable coincidence that Pevsner and Mansfield had once stayed at the same hotel in Bolton, Lancashire. [...] There, she had [...] "electrified the dining room with her imposing bosom". Patricia Vettel-Becker makes that observation more specific by attributing the phenomenon to Playboy and the appearance of Mansfield and Monroe in the magazine. Anita Ekberg and Bettie Page are also added to the list of catalysts besides Mansfield and Monroe. Drawing on the Freudian concept of fetishism, British science fiction writer and socio-cultural commentator J. G. Ballard commented that Mae West, Mansfield and Monroe's breasts [...] "loomed across the horizon of popular consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul {{arrived in}} North Florida for a {{campaign}} event in early January 1988, with ten months still remaining until the election. The event was chronicled by a journalist for the Ocala Star-Banner, who compared Paul to a kamikaze and remarked that he never gives up even though his [...] "chance of becoming president" [...] was no greater than that for the journalist himself. Paul was described as [...] "slim, attractive, graying, immaculately attired and most articulate," [...] but as a candidate who was dismissed by the media for his political positions such as support of the decriminalization of hard drugs. Paul visited the University of Florida during his trip, and gave a campaign speech in front of 200 students in the auditorium in Turlington Hall. Later in the month, he left Florida and campaigned in Iowa, where he spoke at Drake University and the University of Iowa. In February, he received the endorsement of Former Congressman Pete McCloskey (R-Calif.).
