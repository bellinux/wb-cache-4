500|$|The {{disappointment}} of Infinite inspired Eminem {{to create the}} alter ego Slim Shady: [...] "Boom, the name hit me, and right away I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these words to rhyme with it." [...] Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and {{in the spring of}} 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. [...] After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. [...] He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. [...] Dr. Dre recalled, [...] "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'" [...] Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.|$|E

Hardy was talking {{nonsense}} when he insisted that the mathematician was discovering rather than creating, nor was it wholly nonsense for Kepler to exult that he was thinking God's thoughts after him. [...] The world for me is a necessary system, and in {{the degree to which the}} thinker can surrender his thought to that system and follow it, he is in a sense participating in that which is timeless or eternal. [...] This has been part of the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the great rationalists from Plato through Aquinas and Spinoza to Hegel and McTaggart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Culshaw <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> his {{recording}}s, that of Britten's War Requiem was the finest. Greenfield says of it, [...] "another recording which confounded {{the record}} world {{not just by}} its technical brilliance but by the way it sold in huge quantities." [...] The recording was made in London in 1963, {{the year after the}} premiere of the Requiem at the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral. For the recording Culshaw managed to assemble the three singers whom Britten had in mind when writing the work, uniting Russian, German and English soloists to represent the former enemy nations – Galina Vishnevskaya, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Peter Pears.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{months after}} his father's death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. Maria sought {{consolation}} in her faith and in April was admitted {{as a member of}} the First Reformed Dutch Church. Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year. What he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing Redburn: [...] "I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time," [...] the narrator remarks, adding, [...] "I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt... and we removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me." [...] According to Arvin's influential suggestion, with Melville, one has to reckon with the [...] "tormented psychology, of the decayed patrician." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mastered by Guy at The Exchange was {{the first}} Max Tundra record to use vocals. In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media he explained that [...] "The songs are extremely different from those on the first record. When I was writing Some Best Friend, I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> sorts of weird and wonderful machines and instruments I could use to make noises, but singing never occurred to me. I had never considered using my voice on any Max Tundra record ever, but hey, I like to keep things varied, so this time round I figured what the hell!" [...] Max Tundra {{found it difficult to}} write lyrics as well, saying [...] "I'm getting to grips with writing lyrics, but it is somewhat more difficult than anything I've done before... The lyrics themselves are taking ages to write-- it's something I'm not used to." [...] The other vocalist on the album is Becky Jacobs who is Max Tundra's sister. The album's title is literal; it was mastered by Guy Davie at a studio named The Exchange.|$|E

60|$|It was yet {{moonlight}} when {{we pushed}} from the islet. But soon, the sky grew dun; the moon {{went into a}} cavern among the clouds; and by that secret sympathy between our hearts and the elements, the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> but Media became overcast.|$|R
2500|$|Ester Dean and Dr. Luke {{also worked}} on the album, {{respectively}} writing and producing the other US lead single [...] "Rose Colored Glasses". The song's lyrics portray [...] "the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship." [...] During Rowland's concert series for iheartradio, the singer took time out {{to reflect on the}} song. She recalled, [...] "The first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose-colored glasses." [...] It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the [...] "toxic relationships" [...] she had been in [...] "where she needed to leave." [...] Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said [...] "It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called [...] "I'm Dat Chick". Although [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a [...] "confidence-boosting" [...] anthem, [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get [...] "even shy women to come out of their shells" [...] according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, [...] "Lay It on Me", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R melody with 808s and high NRG-led production. It features a [...] "tinkling piano" [...] melody and light R beat.|$|E
