30|$|In addition, {{the band}} {{structure}} of a 2 D heterostructure can be affected by many factors. Firstly, {{the quality of the}} interface is very important. For example, the interface defects and impurities can cause the defect or impurity energy level; and intrinsic metal-induced gap states (MIGS) or extrinsic disorder induced gap states (DIGS) at the interface would lead to <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> effect [36]. Bampoulis et al. [37] demonstrated that the subsurface metal-like defects in MoS 2 /metal heterostructures could hugely decrease the Schottky barrier height (SBH) that attributed to strong <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> at <b>the</b> defects. On the other hand, a weak <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> led to <b>the</b> SBH modulation by electrical gating [38], and a very weak <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> has been observed at the graphene/TMD interfaces. A shift of about 120  mV was observed between the spectra of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of flakes residing on single-layer graphene (SLG) and bilayer graphene (BLG) substrates, which is equal to the difference in the work function of SLG and BLG. Secondly, the lattice constants of the materials and their stake orientation are also important factors. When two 2 D materials with similar lattice constants form heterostructures, such as graphene/hBN [39] and SnS 2 /MoS 2 [40], a periodic Moiré pattern will be formed. Figure  3 c, d shows the STM measurements on graphene/hBN heterostructure with a rotation smaller (Fig.  3 d) and larger (Fig.  3 c) than 1 °. The later one displays a nearly same spatial periodic behavior exhibiting a much larger Moiré pattern due to the high Young modulus of graphene. Such deformation of lattice structure results in a much stronger van der Waals interaction and causes extra periodic potential in graphene that adjusts its band structure. Moreover, the indirect band gap varies appreciably with the stacking orientation [41]: the largest redshift for AA-(twist angle of 0 °) and AB-(twist angle of 60 °) stacked bilayers and a significantly smaller but constant redshift for all other twist angles (Fig.  3 e).|$|R
40|$|The {{excellent}} physical and semiconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers make them promising materials for many applications. The TMDC monolayer MoS[subscript 2] has gained significant attention as a channel material for next-generation transistors. However, while n-type single-layer MoS 2 devices {{can be made}} with relative ease, fabrication of p-type transistors remains a challenge as <b>the</b> <b>Fermi-level</b> of elemental metals used as contacts are pinned close to the conduction band leading to large p-type Schottky barrier heights (SBH). Here, we propose the utilization of graphene oxide (GO) as an efficient hole injection layer for single-layer MoS[subscript 2]-based electronic and optoelectronic devices. Using first-principles computations, we demonstrate that GO forms a p-type contact with monolayer MoS[subscript 2], and that the p-type SBH can be made smaller by increasing the oxygen concentration and the fraction of epoxy functional groups in GO. Our analysis shows that this is possible due to the high work function of GO and <b>the</b> relatively weak <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> at <b>the</b> MoS[subscript 2]/GO interfaces compared to traditional MoS[subscript 2]/metal systems (common metals are Ag, Al, Au, Ir, Pd, Pt). The combination of easy-to-fabricate and inexpensive GO with MoS[subscript 2] could be promising for the development of hybrid all- 2 D p-type electronic and optoelectronic devices on flexible substrates.
