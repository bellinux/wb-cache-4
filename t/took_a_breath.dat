The Second Balkan War, also known as Inter-Ally War, left Bulgaria only with the Struma valley and a small part of Thrace with minor ports at the Aegean sea. Vardar Macedonia was incorporated into Serbia and thereafter referred to as South Serbia. Southern (Aegean) Macedonia was incorporated into Greece and thereafter was referred to as northern Greece. The region suffered heavily during the Second Balkan War. During its advance at the end of June, the Greek army set fire to the Bulgarian quarter of the town of Kilkis and over 160 villages around Kilkis and Serres driving some 50,000 refugees into Bulgaria proper. The Bulgarian army retaliated by burning the Greek quarter of Serres and by arming Muslims from the region of Drama which led to a massacre of Greek civilians.|$|E
500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} an acoustic-jazz {{version of the}} song at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria in May 15, 2011. During the song, she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum, {{but she said she}} wanted to air the track in full. Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of the}} set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> and then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went just a little too far for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?" [...] Conversely, Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga's most memorable television performances. Monica Herrera from Billboard listed it as the fourth best performance of the night, and felt that Gaga [...] "channeled Bruce Springsteen" [...] in her personality.|$|E

50|$|The {{steadiness}} {{test was}} measured by having each participant hold a brass rod 2.5 mm in diameter at arms length. This rod was in a hole 6 mm in diameter. While standing {{they were asked to}} hold it for 30 seconds and make the least amount of contact with the hole. Each contact {{was measured by}} an electric counter. Due to high variability of the averages the data was deemed unreliable. This was proved by the fact that outside or external forces could affect the outcome greatly. Examples of this would be if the participant coughed, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> or got startled by a noise.|$|E

5000|$|Bradley's command {{took the}} initial brunt {{of what would}} become the Battle of the Bulge. For {{logistical}} and command reasons, General Eisenhower decided to place Bradley's First and Ninth Armies under the temporary command of Field Marshal Montgomery's 21st Army Group on the northern flank of the Bulge. Bradley was incensed, and began shouting at Eisenhower: [...] "By God, Ike, I cannot be responsible to the American people if you do this. I resign." [...] Eisenhower turned red, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> and replied evenly [...] "Brad, I—not you—am responsible to the American people. Your resignation therefore means absolutely nothing." [...] Bradley paused, made one more protest, then fell silent as Eisenhower concluded [...] "Well, Brad, those are my orders." [...] At least one historian has attributed Eisenhower's support for Bradley's subsequent promotion to (temporary) four-star general (March 1945, not made permanent until January 1949) to, in part, a desire to compensate him for the way in which he had been sidelined during the Battle of the Bulge. [...] Others point out that both Secretary of War Stimson and General Eisenhower had desired to reward General Patton with a fourth star for his string of accomplishments in 1944, but that Eisenhower could not promote Patton over Bradley, Devers, and other senior commanders without upsetting the chain of command (as Bradley commanded these people in the theater).|$|E
