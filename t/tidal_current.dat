25|$|The first in-stream <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> {{generator}} in North America (Race Rocks Tidal Power Demonstration Project) {{was installed}} at Race Rocks on southern Vancouver Island in September 2006.

25|$|A tidal {{generator}} converts {{the energy}} of tidal flows into electricity. Greater tidal variation and higher <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|Tidal energy can be {{extracted}} by two means: inserting a water turbine into a <b>tidal</b> <b>current,</b> or building ponds that release/admit water through a turbine. In the first case, the energy amount is entirely {{determined by the}} timing and <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> magnitude. However, the best currents may be unavailable because the turbines would obstruct ships. In the second, the impoundment dams are expensive to construct, natural water cycles are completely disrupted, ship navigation is disrupted. However, with multiple ponds, power can be generated at chosen times. So far, there are few installed systems for tidal power generation (most famously, La Rance at Saint Malo, France) which face many difficulties. Aside from environmental issues, simply withstanding corrosion and biological fouling pose engineering challenges.|$|E

(1990) {{reported}} that strong (∼ 1 m⋅s−[*] 1) parabathic <b>tidal</b> <b>currents</b> resuspended newly deposited muds and advected them alongshore. It appears that <b>tidal</b> <b>currents</b> are more powerful than hyperpycnal flows. The velocity values used in numerical modeling studies are from <b>tidal</b> <b>currents</b> (e.g., Wang et al. 2010). Disappointingly, there are no empirical data on velocity measurement of hyperpycnal flows from the Yellow River mouth (Wright et al. 1986).|$|R

From the obsevation of <b>tidal</b> <b>currents</b> for about 5 hours on 9 Feb. 1966,it was found that there are various currents of which the periods are in a range of 2 secto 48 mm beside the <b>tidal</b> <b>currents.</b> These were analysed into harmonic components. And tidal constituents and seiche are also studied by refering the obsevation carriedOut by Kinki Regional Construction Bueau, Ministry of Construction. From the resultsof harmonic analyses, it became clear that non-linear effect of <b>tidal</b> <b>currents</b> is remarcableand that the component of seiche in the Harima-Nada is about one tenth of the observedcurrent velocity.

25|$|The graph of Cook Strait's tides shows {{separately}} {{the high}} water and low water height and time, through November 2007; {{these are not}} measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years-old measurements. Cook Strait's nautical chart offers <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> information. For instance the January 1979 edition for 41°13·9’S 174°29·6’E (north west of Cape Terawhiti) refers timings to Westport while the January 2004 issue refers to Wellington. Near Cape Terawhiti {{in the middle of}} Cook Strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> reaches its maximum, especially near the notorious Karori Rip. Aside from weather effects, the actual currents through Cook Strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen, only one of the two spring tides at the north end (Nelson) has a counterpart spring tide at the south end (Wellington), so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour.|$|E
25|$|Oscillating {{currents}} {{produced by}} tides {{are known as}} tidal streams. The moment that the <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> ceases is called slack water or slack tide. The tide then reverses direction and {{is said to be}} turning. Slack water usually occurs near high water and low water. But there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those of high and low water.|$|E
25|$|At about 11 h. 30 m. pm {{the four}} divisions, who {{had crossed the}} Channel tied together, put off from the Medusa in good order, but they lost touch with each other because of the {{darkness}} of the moonless night. The <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> and the half-tide separated them further, causing Robert Jones’s division to be swept past the French vessels and saw no action. The other three divisions attacked different parts of the French line separately and at different times.|$|E

25|$|GPS {{receivers}} {{using two}} or more antennae mounted separately and blending the data with an inertial motion unit (IMU) can now achieve 0.02° in heading accuracy and have startup times in seconds rather than hours for gyrocompass systems. The devices accurately determine the positions (latitudes, longitudes and altitude) of the antennae on the Earth, from which the cardinal directions can be calculated. Manufactured primarily for maritime and aviation applications, they can also detect pitch and roll of ships. Small, portable GPS receivers with only a single antenna can also determine directions if they are being moved, even if only at walking pace. By accurately determining its position on the Earth at times a few seconds apart, the device can calculate its speed and the true bearing (relative to true north) of its direction of motion. Frequently, it is preferable to measure {{the direction in which}} a vehicle is actually moving, rather than its heading, i.e. the direction in which its nose is pointing. These directions may be different if there is a crosswind or <b>tidal</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
25|$|Biotic factors here play a {{significant}} role in physical coastal evolution, and for wildlife a variety of habitats have developed which include beaches, estuaries, permanent and semi-permanent swamps, tidal flats, tidal creeks, coastal dunes, back dunes and levees. The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays {{a significant}} role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop micromorphological features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the eolian dunes is controlled by an abundance of xerophytic and halophytic plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day. The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.|$|E

500|$|With the Middlesex in the vanguard, {{the lead}} {{elements}} of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade successfully crossed the Chongchon unopposed at Sinanju on 24 October using assault boats. The British battalion then established a defensive position over-looking the main bridge {{in preparation for the}} remainder of the brigade to continue the advance the following day. However, both the road and rail bridges at Sinanju had previously been damaged and they were subsequently found to be unsuitable for use by vehicles and armour, while the <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> also prevented the rafting of even light vehicles by the American engineers attached to the brigade. Meanwhile, the road bridge at Anju, [...] east, was also found to be damaged by ROK 1st Division when it entered the town. Following repairs the bridge was made available to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade's light wheeled vehicles on 25 October, while the accompanying Sherman tanks located a ford [...] upstream, and were able to cross the Chongchon at that point. With winter approaching, the British and Australians encountered the first of the cold weather as the temperature began to drop well below freezing at night. Consequently, prior to leaving Sinanju purpose-designed American cold-weather clothing was issued; however, with stocks in short supply only a few of the men received the equipment, even after a second issue was arranged several days later.|$|E

EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid connected tidal test site is located at the Fall of Warness, off the island of Eday, in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. This area has a very strong <b>tidal</b> <b>current,</b> which can travel up to 4m/s (8 knots) in spring tides. [...] Tidal energy developers that have tested at the site include: Alstom (formerly Tidal Generation Ltd); ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest; Atlantis Resources Corporation; Nautricity; OpenHydro; Scotrenewables Tidal Power; Voith. The resource could be 4 TJ per year. Elsewhere in the UK, annual energy of 50 TWh can be extracted if 25 GW capacity is installed with pivotable blades.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose the}} use of {{techniques}} from Machine Learning for the prediction of <b>tidal</b> <b>currents.</b> The classical methodology of harmonic analysis is widely used in the prediction of <b>tidal</b> <b>currents</b> and computer algorithms based on the method {{have been used for}} decades for the purpose. The approach determines parameters by minimizing the difference between the raw data and model output using the least squares optimization approach. However, although the approach is considered to be state-of-the-art, it possesses several drawbacks that can lead to significant prediction errors, especially at locations of fast <b>tidal</b> <b>currents</b> and ’noisy’ <b>tidal</b> signal. In general, careful selection of tidal constituents is required in order to achieve good predictions, and the underlying assumption of stationarity in time can restrict the applicability of the method to particular situations. There is a need for principled approaches which can handle uncertainty and accommodate noise in the data. In this work, we use Gaussian process, a Bayesian non-parametric technique, to predict <b>tidal</b> <b>currents.</b> The overall objective is {{to take advantage of the}} recent progress in machine learning to construct a robust yet efficient algorithm. The development can specifically benefit the tidal energy community, aiming to harness energy from location of fast <b>tidal</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Sea swimming: The {{beach on}} Viking Bay is patrolled by lifeguards {{during the summer}} and is popular with swimmers. Dickens swam there. There are public toilets at the beach level, as well as basic {{changing}} facilities and a single fresh water shower (summer only). The bay is marked by striped posts on rocks at either end, and the bay is alternately full of water at high tide or completely dry at low tide. [...] At high tide, the beach shelf drops off quickly and a swimmer can be out of their depth within a few feet of the shore. At middle and low tides, the shelf is much more gently sloping and it is possible to play in the surf, and even swim, in water that is only waist high. At high tide and middle tide, swimmers that stay within the bay (within the posts) are completely sheltered from the tidal stream of the English Channel. At any tide, swimmers venturing out beyond the striped posts may encounter a strong <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> running parallel to the coast, flowing either from south to north or north to south, depending on whether the tide is coming up the English Channel or draining out through it. Even strong experienced swimmers will find it difficult to make progress against this tidal stream at its greatest flow, and swimmers in difficulty should swim directly towards the nearest part of the shore, rather than try to return {{to the point where they}} originally entered.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable {{activity}} was observed {{on the beaches}} and the [...] "Jig Green" [...] beach area was under fire from a German [...] gun situated west of Arromanches-les-Bains. British cruisers lying about [...] off shore carried out a naval bombardment of that area. At 11:46 shells from another German 8.8cm gun began falling near ships {{in the area and}} a British destroyer north of LST-21 engaged the shore battery. The first load was taken into the beach at 15:40 by Rhino ferry and at 19:15 LST-21 got underway toward the beach to meet the Rhino ferry which was laboring through <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> setting due east. The seas were choppy and the wind freshening. The LST took on 13 casualties from a DUKW and the Rhino ferry returned at 21:45 and departed at 22:40 with the remaining vehicles disembarked from LST-21. The LST then got underway for her assigned anchorage. Ten minutes later ships began making smoke on a red alert, followed nine minutes later by a second red alert. Two minutes later, amidst anti-aircraft fire from the west three bombs successively hit the water on the port beam, a fourth hitting [...] off the starboard bow. At 22:30 a stick of four bombs hit the water from broad on the port bow to dead ahead, [...] and at 23:42 a stick of four bombs hit the water [...] off the port bow.

The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories.

The <b>tidal</b> <b>current</b> runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests--and that never returned.
