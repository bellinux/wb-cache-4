40|$|Background: Although {{physical}} activity during pregnancy may be beneficial, the prenatal period is a vulnerable <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>decreasing</b> {{physical activity}} levels and increasing sedentary time. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study measured physical activity using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) in singleton, pregnant women in the second (14 - 18 wk gestation; n = 332) and third trimester (29 - 33 wk; n = 256). Results: There was {{a significant decrease in}} total MVPA (MET mins/wk) between the second and third trimester (P =. 01). The majority of physical activity time was spent in walking for transport (80 %), and less than 2 % in recreational activities. In both trimesters, being married was inversely associated with walking for transport (second trimester: ¿ = - 0. 12 95 % CI = - 0. 31 to - 0. 02, third trimester: ¿ = - 0. 17 95 % CI = - 0. 47 to - 0. 07) and owning a car was positively associated with recreational physical activity (second trimester: ¿ = 0. 16 95 % CI = 0. 02 to 0. 32, third trimester: ¿ = 0. 17 95 % CI = 0. 04 to 0. 27). The women spent an average of 5 hours per day sitting. Conclusion: The low and declining levels of physical activity during pregnancy in this population are a concern.

40|$|In Newtonian gravity {{the final}} states of cold dissipationless collapses are {{characterized}} by several structural and dynamical properties remarkably {{similar to those of}} observed elliptical galaxies. Are these properties a peculiarity of the Newtonian force or a more general feature of long-range forces? We study this problem by means of N-body simulations of dissipationless collapse of systems of particles interacting via additive r^-α forces. We find that most of the results holding in Newtonian gravity are also valid for α≠ 2. In particular the end products are triaxial and never flatter than an E 7 system, their surface density profiles are well described by the Sérsic law, the global density slope-anisotropy inequality is obeyed, the differential energy distribution is an exponential over a large range of energies (for α≥ 1), and the pseudo phase-space density is a power law of radius. In addition, we show that the process of virialization takes longer (in units of the system's dynamical <b>time)</b> <b>for</b> <b>decreasing</b> values of α, and becomes infinite for α=- 1 (the harmonic oscillator). This is in agreement with the results of deep-MOND collapses (qualitatively corresponding to α= 1) and it {{is due to the fact}} the force becomes more and more similar to the α=- 1 case, where as well known no relaxation can happen and the system oscillates forever.
