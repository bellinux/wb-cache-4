According to NASA report, tests show 12 repairs on same weld joint do not adversely affect ultimate <b>tensile</b> <b>strenth,</b> yield strength, fatigue strength, metallurgical grain structures, or ability of weld joint {{to respond to}} post weld heat treatments...|$|E
40|$|The microstructures of Ti 3 Al+lZr (α 2 Zr) and Ti 3 Al+Nb (α 2 +Nb) {{produced}} by ingot metallurgy (IM) and by rapid solidification (RS) are compared. Grain refinement {{was observed in}} both RS Ti 3 Al+Zr and RS Ti 3 Al+Nb alloys, and heat treatment of RS Ti 3 Al+Nb ribbons produced refined α 2 microstructures compared with those observed in the IM material. Ti 3 Al+Nb RS ribbons yielded good room temperature <b>tensile</b> <b>strenth</b> and elongation, and were successfully compacted by extrusion at 925 °C (1700 °F), resulting in a fine α 2 structure...|$|E

To avoid expensive requalification of all the engines and airframe fuel systems, methodologies to qualify future fuels by using bench-scale and component testing are being sought. Fuel blends with increasing JP 5 -type aromatic concentration were seen to produce less volume swell than an equivalent aromatic concentration in the reference fuel. Futhermore, blends with naphthenes, decalin, tetralin, and naphthalenes do not deviate significantly from the correlation line of aromatic blends, Similar results are found with <b>tensile</b> <b>strenth</b> and elongation. Other elastomers, sealants, and adhesives are also being tested...|$|E

SEM was engaged in studying the effects of silica fibers disposed by different methods, and the tensile strength of disposed silica fbers was compared with the originals. The {{results showed that the}} heat treatment in the high temperature was a useful means to eliminate the agent on the surface of silica fiber, but there was great thermal damage for silica fibers, and the <b>tensile</b> <b>strenth</b> decreased significantly. The combination of volvent treatment and heat tratment could eliminate the agent on tht surface of silica fibers completely, and the tensile strength retained more, which was a good means to eliminate the agents on the surface of silica fiber...|$|E
40|$|The {{profiled}} steel {{roof and}} wall cladding systems in Australia are commonly made of very thin high tensile steels, and are crest-fixed with screw fasteners. A review of current literature and design standards indicated {{the need to}} improve the understanding of the behaviour of crest-fixed steel cladding systems under wind uplift/suction loading, in particular, the local failures. Therefore a detailed experimental study using a series of small scale tests and some two-span cladding tests was conducted to investigate the local pull-through and dimpling failures in the commonly used steel cladding systems. The applicability of the current design formulae for the pull-through strength of crest-fixed steel classing systems was investigated first. An improved design formula was then developed in terms of the thickness and ultimate <b>tensile</b> <b>strenth</b> of steel cladding material and diameter of screw head or washer. This paper presents the details of this investigation and its results. A review of current design and test methods is also included...|$|E
