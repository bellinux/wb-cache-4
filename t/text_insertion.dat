40|$|Technical-term {{translation}} {{represents one}} of the most difficult tasks for human translators since (1) most translators are not familiar with terms and domain-specific terminology and (2) such terms are not adequately covered by printed dictionaries. This paper describes an algorithm for translating technical words and terms from noisy parallel corpora across language groups. Given any word which is part of a technical term in the source language, the algorithm produces a ranked candidate match for it in the target language. Potential translations for the term are compiled from the matched words and are also ranked. We show how this ranked list helps translators in technical-term translation. Most algorithms for lexical and term translation focus on Indo-European language pairs, and most use a sentence-aligned clean parallel corpus without insertion, deletion or OCR noise. Our algorithm is language- and character-set-independent, and is robust to noise in the corpus. We show how our algorithm requires minimum preprocessing and is able to obtain technical-word translations without sentence-boundary identification or sentence alignment, from the English–Japanese awk manual corpus with noise arising from <b>text</b> <b>insertions</b> or deletions and on the English–Chinese HKUST bilingual corpus. We obtain a precision of 55. 35 % from the awk corpus for word translation including rare words, counting only the best candidate and direct translations. Translation precision of the best-candidate translation is 89. 93 % from the HKUST corpus. Potential term translations produced by the program help bilingual speakers to get a 47 % improvement in translating technical terms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The cartographic label {{placement}} is {{an important}} task in automated cartography and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Positioning the texts requires that overlap among texts be avoided, that cartographic conventions and preference be obeyed. So, the label placement belongs to a problem area of difficult solution. A variety of methods have been proposed to generate quality labeling, {{with a wide range}} of results. In this work, two methods are presented, a Constructive Genetic Algorithm (CGA) and an initial exact method for small instances. The CGA application produced quality-labeling placements for printed maps, and the exact method is used to confirm the superiority of these results. Key words: Constructive genetic algorithm, point-feature cartographic label placement, genetic algorithm and exact algorithm. Cartographic label placement refers to the <b>text</b> <b>insertion</b> process in maps and is one of the most challenging problems in geoprocessing and automated cartography [12].

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{advances}} in computer-based communication and health services, the need for image security becomes urgent to address the requirements of both safety and non-safety in medical applications. This paper proposes a new fragile watermarking based scheme for image authentication and self-recovery for medical applications. The proposed scheme locates image tampering as well as recovers the original image. A host image is broken into 4 × 4 blocks and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied by inserting the traces of block wise SVD into the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the image pixels {{to figure out the}} transformation in the original image. Two authentication bits namely block authentication and self-recovery bits were used to survive the vector quantization attack. The insertion of self-recovery bits is determined with Arnold transformation, which recovers the original image even after a high tampering rate. SVD-based watermarking information improves the image authentication and provides a way to detect different attacked area. The proposed scheme is tested against different types of attacks such are text removal attack, <b>text</b> <b>insertion</b> attack, and copy and paste attack...|$|E

Specifically in photo-finishing and direct marketing applications, a natural image can be personalized by adding new text or changing existing text in an intelligent and natural way. Current solutions to achieve the aforementioned natural <b>text</b> <b>insertion</b> and replacement are however highly manual, requiring a lot of time, effort and skills. In this dissertation, a semi automatic framework is proposed, which is capable of inserting and replacing text on both planar and cylindrical surfaces. Techniques in image processing and computer vision such as the bilateral filter, the Hough transform, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the polygon triangulation, and the connected component analysis are combined, along with necessary user inputs. Unlike current solutions which utilize 2 -D text rendering, a 3 -D pinhole camera is used as our rendering model, which introduces significant flexibility. Also, an image pre-analysis and recommendation algorithm is developed and included in the framework to help pre-screen a set of images according to their suitability for personalization, i. e., whether there are smooth regions and/or existing text inside the images. Popular learning-based classifiers such as multinomial logistic regression are utilized. The semi-automatic framework has been implemented as a tool in Java. The developed tool and experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. ...|$|E

A goal of the bachelor thesis is to examine how existing text recognition technologies can be applied to frames of screenshot videos, in order to identify interaction elements of graphical user interfaces used by the user. As regards that, it was necessary to find the relevant temporal positions and the appropriate graphic data of the video file. The video file contains a screenshot video of a test person and an integrated data stream of the eye- or mouse movement. With the resulting picture information, the position of the cursor at this temporal position can be used to receive the picture data, which match the click position of the user.

The main advantages of the scheme are its power, efficiency and language independence.

40|$|Background: Hardly any Indian data is {{available}} regarding practices employed by parents for preventing injuries and aspiration and controlling convulsions in children. Aims: To describe the health care-seeking behavior and practices employed by parents {{when a child}} has convulsions. Settings and Design: Prospective questionnaire-based study in a tertiary care hospital setting. Materials and Methods: Parents of children (age: 1 month - 12 years) admitted with history of convulsions were enrolled and information regarding demographic characteristics, time lag, preferred health care provider and measures taken in a convulsing child was elicited using a pretested questionnaire. Statistical Analysis Used: Demographic parameters and measures employed described as percentages. Results: One hundred and forty parents were interviewed. Seventy-six children had first episode. Forty-nine of 64 children with subsequent seizures had contact with a health care provider during the previous seizure episode. The median duration of seizures was 10 minutes (Mean: 54. 15 &#x 00 B 1; 366. 39 min); but children {{were brought to the}} hospital after a median of 2 hours (Mean: 5. 22 &#x 00 B 1; 10. 37 h).

Although 45 with previous seizure-related health care contact agreed that they were informed about measures to be taken, none of them could remember more than one measure for preventing injuries and aspiration and controlling seizures. Only four narrated "per-rectal administration of diazepam" as a measure, although only one implemented it. Only four general practitioners used per-rectal diazepam to control seizures.

40|$|In this study, a {{learning}} device {{based on the}} PATtree data structures was developed. The original PAT-trees were enhanced with the deletion function to emulate human learning competence. The learning process worked as follows. The linguistic patterns from the text corpus are inserted into the PAT-tree one by one.

The proposed PAT-trees with the deletion function have the following advantages. 1) They are easy to construct and maintain. 2) Any prefix substring and its frequency count through PAT-tree can be searched very quickly. 3) The space requirement for a PAT-tree is linear {{with respect to the}} size of the input <b>text.</b> 4) The <b>insertion</b> of a new element can be carried out at any time without being blocked by the memory constraints because the free space is released through the deletion of unimportant elements.

40|$|AbstractThe suffix tree data {{structure}} has been intensively described, studied {{and used in}} the eighties and nineties, its linear-time construction counterbalancing his space-consuming requirements. An equivalent {{data structure}}, the suffix array, {{has been described by}} Manber and Myers in 1990. This space-economical structure has been neglected during more than a decade, its construction being too slow. Since 2003, several linear-time suffix array construction algorithms have been proposed, and this structure has slowly replaced the suffix tree in many string processing problems. All these constructions are building the suffix array from the text, and any edit operation on the text leads to the construction of a brand new suffix array. In this article, we are presenting an algorithm that modifies the suffix array and the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array when the <b>text</b> is edited (<b>insertion,</b> substitution or deletion of a letter or a factor). This algorithm is based on a recent four-stage algorithm developed for dynamic Burrows–Wheeler Transforms (BWT). For minimizing the space complexity, we are sampling the Suffix Array, a technique used in BWT-based compressed indexes. We furthermore explain how this technique can be adapted for maintaining a sample of the Extended Suffix Array, containing a sample of the Suffix Array, a sample of the Inverse Suffix Array and the whole LCP array. Our practical experiments show that it operates very well in practice, being quicker than the fastest suffix array construction algorithm...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies redaction criticism {{to study}} Mark 12 : 28 - 34. My approach differs from previous redactional analyses because I use the microcomputer to isolate data for analysis. Through a careful redactional anlysis applying the grammatical and syntactical characteristics isolated through computer analysis, I show that Mark has constructed the unit {{to emphasize the}} concept of the 2 ̆ 2 oneness of God 2 ̆ 2. The imperative to Israel that Yahweh is One (Deut 6 : 4) grounds the ethical norms of love of God and neighbor (Deut 6 : 5; Lev 19 : 18) which the unit declares. Having noted the importance of {{the concept of the}} 2 ̆ 2 oneness of God 2 ̆ 2 in the unit, I examine the origin and use of that concept from a double perspective: 1) examination of the Old Testament understanding of the oneness of God in Deuteronomy 6 : 4 f, 2) its development in Judaism through the Rabbinic period. This will show how this text was understood {{at the time of the}} composition of Mark. Second, I present a redaction critical analysis of other Markan texts which contain traditions concerning the 2 ̆ 2 one God 2 ̆ 2. The analysis shows these <b>texts</b> are <b>insertions</b> transforming apophthegms into controversy stories which concern the nature and authority of Jesus. In each case, attributes of God are being applied to Jesus. Finally, I examine the context of Mark 12 : 28 - 34 to see whether Mark 2 ̆ 7 s theology of 2 ̆ 2 one God 2 ̆ 2 is found in the units forming its context. This will determine whether the text of Mark 12 : 28 - 34 is from the same hand as the rest of the Gospel. From this study, I conclude that the redaction of this unit reflects a situation in which there is friction between the community and Judaism stemming from misunderstanding in three areas: (1) discussion concerning the nature of Jesus, (2) the attitude of the community toward the traditions of Judaism, and (3) the understanding of the Kingdom of God which was prevelant in the community. Mark, thus, uses the concept of One God in his gospel as an apologetic against the objections of Jews to the stances of the community in those areas...|$|R
