Andretti had one win on <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> finished {{fifth in the}} season points, and {{finished second in the}} dirt championship. He competed in USAC's dirt track division in 1974, and won the dirt track championship while competing in both series. Andretti also competed in the North American Formula 5000 series in 1973 and 1974, and finished second in the championship in both seasons.|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the motorway was suspended by {{the onset of the}} Croatian War of Independence. In October 1991, a part of the motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška became inaccessible to the government of the Republic of Croatia due to military occupation of the area by the forces of the so-called SAO Western Slavonia. Consequently, the NovskaNova Gradiška section was closed to all traffic. On December 21, 1994, negotiations led to the reopening of that section for transit traffic. However, the section remained unsafe for use as intermittent violence continued until May 1995, when the area was overrun by the Croatian army. Inspection of the motorway section carried out at the time revealed damage to a viaduct carrying the motorway over the ZagrebSisakVinkovci railroad and a local road near Novska. Besides the overall lack of maintenance during the period, <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> a number of flyovers were damaged by artillery bombardments, and the flyover approach embankments were damaged where trenches were dug.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) calls John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{to inform}} {{him about the}} case and says {{she will not be}} joining him, due to personal matters. Doggett visits the crime scene, where he meets up with his boss, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Skinner tells him about the cult and how the victims died. Leeds' body is found in his car, but his partner, Stedman, is missing, along with cult leader Anthony Tipet (Keith Szarabajka): the man with the third eye. The FBI later finds Stedman at his locked-up condo with a fatal blow to the head. Meanwhile, Tipet is searching for a pharmacist and stumbles into a phone booth to call an unnamed person. When a tramp asks him for change, Tipet attacks the tramp, trapping him in <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> axing his forehead.|$|E

5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E

25|$|In 2008-2009, {{a second}} {{restoration}} took place. The Vrouwekerk's crumbling church walls were heightened {{by one and}} a half metres and covered by natural stone. Stone was also used to indicate the contours of the church in <b>the</b> <b>pavement,</b> <b>and</b> to show where the graves within the church were located.

25|$|Profiled {{thermoplastic}} markings {{are created}} by fusing thermoplastic to <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> create alternating elevation and recession pattern. This can be done as inverted-profile markings or raised-profile markings. Inverted-profile markings {{are created by}} pressing a cog rolling over the markings while they are wet to make them corrugated. Raised-profile markings are created by extruding extra thickness of thermoplastic at a specific interval to create bumps. Raised-profile markings are sometime known as convex traffic lines.|$|E

25|$|On {{the grounds}} of the facility, cracks in <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> soil were present, but no surface {{faulting}} was present. In addition to the collapse of the stairways, the elevators were out of commission. Power and communications failures affected the hospital {{at the time of the}} earthquake, but very few people occupied the lower floors and the stairways at the early hour. Casualties in these highly affected areas might have increased had the shock occurred later in the day. The duration of strong ground motion at that location was probably similar to the 12 seconds that was observed at the Pacoima Dam, and an additional few seconds of shaking is thought to have been enough to bring the building to collapse.|$|E
25|$|Having {{broken through}} the barrier, the truck, driving in a zigzag fashion, knocked down random {{members of the}} crowd milling about on <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> in the three traffic lanes on the seaward side of the Promenade. The driver tried {{to stay on the}} pavement—returning to the traffic lanes only when blocked by a bus shelter or pavilion—thus {{increasing}} the number of deaths. After reaching the Hotel Negresco, the progress of the truck, already travelling more slowly, was further slowed down by a passing cyclist, whose attempts to open the cabin door were abandoned after being threatened with a gun through the window; followed by a motorcyclist, in pursuit from the Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen, who threw his scooter under the front wheels of the truck at the intersection with rue Meyerbeer, striking blows at the driver from the running board before being struck with the butt of the driver's gun, suffering moderate injuries from falling off the truck's side. The driver fired several shots at police from his 7.65mm firearm, close to the Hotel Negresco, as police arrived; they returned fire with their 9mm Sig Sauer handguns, gave chase to the vehicle and attempted to disable it.|$|E

500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E
500|$|Twelve {{blocks in}} length, it is intersected by the Portland Streetcar and forms the Portland Cultural District and the greenspace {{at the center}} of Portland State University. The New York Times stated the blocks are [...] "literally {{at the heart of the}} city's {{cultural}} life." [...] Every block contains public art, such as Shemanski Fountain (1926), designed by Carl L. Linde, with drinking wells, including special drinking wells for dogs. Other art includes Paul Sutinen's In the Shadow of the Elm (built into <b>the</b> <b>pavement),</b> <b>and</b> three large blocks of granite titled Peace Chant (1984). Two large statues are in the block: a $40,000, [...] bronze equestrian statue called Theodore Roosevelt, Rough Rider, designed by Alexander Phimister Proctor, commissioned by Roosevelt's personal friend and Portlander Henry Waldo Coe and added in 1922, and one of Abraham Lincoln, [...] "facing north, slump-shouldered and pensive", added in 1928, commissioned by Coe in 1926, sculpted by George Fife Waters. The park also contains approximately 337 elm, oak, and maple trees valued at $3.4 million, as well as roses. A plaque from the Lang Syne Society was placed in the South Park Blocks at Jefferson Street in 1991, commemorating the Great Plank Road.|$|E

60|$|Comical {{incidents}} were strangely mingled with these awful scenes, {{although it is}} but justice to say the prevailing tone of the crowd was one of solemnity.
