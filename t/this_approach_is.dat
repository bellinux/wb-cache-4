5|$|Approximations {{using the}} first few terms of a Taylor series can make {{otherwise}} unsolvable problems possible for a restricted domain; <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> often used in physics.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires {{the use of}} a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E
5|$|The goal of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> twofold: {{to enable}} deeper {{inspection}} of the code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution, and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by {{eliminating the need for}} runtime scheduling circuitry.|$|E

5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} problem with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> that it relied heavily upon {{an assumption that}} Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of}} the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
30|$|<b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> {{shown to}} be less painful than the medial <b>approach,</b> but <b>was</b> {{associated}} with greater extra-articular contrast leakage in one study [17].

40|$|Visualization {{is often}} more an art than a science. Here a model-based <b>approach</b> to {{visualization}} <b>is</b> promoted {{in order to make}} steps forward in this respect. The main ingredients of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> the derivation of a quantitative model of the perception of (certain aspects of) a visualization, the definition of an optimal visualization, followed by its computation. Some examples of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> presented, with optimal zooming and panning as main example. Advantages and problems are discussed. In conclusion, we think <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> to <b>be</b> challenging and promising, although we acknowledge that it is not an easy route...|$|R
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Most enzyme {{kinetics}} studies concentrate on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, {{it is also}} possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> useful as an alternative to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.|$|E
5|$|Past {{species have}} also left records of their {{evolutionary}} history. Fossils, {{along with the}} comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record. By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} is fairly {{common in the}} United States and east Asian countries. The advantages of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> the further reduction of manual labour time and cost per unit area of slab and a simple and systematic building technique. The disadvantages of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> the necessary high lifting capacity of building site cranes, additional expensive crane time, higher material costs and little flexibility.|$|R

5|$|Public {{sociology}} {{refers to}} an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology {{is also part of}} the broader field of science communication or science journalism. In a distinct but similar vein, applied sociology, also known as clinical sociology, policy sociology or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E
5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Aldford Approach {{leads from}} the village of Aldford and crosses the River Dee by the GradeI listed Aldford Iron Bridge, which was built in 1824 by William Hazledine for the 1stMarquis. Iron Bridge Lodge, {{adjacent}} to this bridge, was designed by Douglas and Fordham in 1894 and is listed at GradeII. Also on <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> Coachmore Hill Lodge which was designed in the 1880s by Douglas; it is listed at GradeII. On the approach, near the Dutch Tea Garden are gates with an overthrow, and piers dating from about 1870 in Classic Revival style, listed at GradeII.|$|E

5|$|The {{practicality}} of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> questionable {{with modern}} material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun {{would have an}} overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, {{which is about the}} same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|Since their inception, U2 have {{developed}} and maintained a distinctly recognisable sound, {{with emphasis on}} melodic instrumentals and expressive, larger-than-life vocals. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> rooted partly in the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite {{at a time when}} the band was not known for musical proficiency. The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature delay to craft his distinctive guitar work, coupled with an Irish-influenced drone played against his syncopated melodies that ultimately yields a well-defined ambient, chiming sound. Bono has nurtured his falsetto operatic voice and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social, political, and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting. In addition, the Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
