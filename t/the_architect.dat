30|$|<b>The</b> <b>architects</b> used <b>the</b> {{existing}} documentation {{to perform}} the mapping of the system architecture into code. The {{time spent in the}} mapping was 2 weeks (i.e., 80 man/h) because the documentation was incomplete and consequently required more time from <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> to reach a consensus on the planned architecture. <b>The</b> <b>architects</b> used naming standards for the mapping because it is less intrusive than annotating the source code.

Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by <b>the</b> <b>architect</b> John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E
