5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began {{exploring}} theatrical concepts on the group's albums; {{these themes}} became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted {{to a traditional}} rock format throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because they are unable to find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E

5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is {{vulnerable}} <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain.

Harmony in my Head often emphasizes B-sides, live bootlegs and other rarities, and nearly every episode has featured a song {{either by the}} Beastie Boys or British group The Fall.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> tissue.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers who cared little for the {{buildings}}. For a brief time, the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold.|$|E

5|$|A laserdisc {{edition of}} Hard Boiled was {{released}} by The Criterion Collection in December 1995. A Region Free DVD of Hard Boiled {{was released by}} The Criterion Collection on 10 July 1998. A second Region 1 DVD of the film was released by Fox Lorber. Fox Lorber released the film as a stand-alone release and as a double feature with The Killer on 3 October 2000. Originally, when Miramax bought the rights <b>to</b> <b>Hard</b> Boiled, The Killer, and Bullet to the Head, they intended to release it in a cut version on video, it was until Woo prevented them from releasing it except Woo prefers his cut of his films to be released. The most recent Region 1 release of Hard Boiled was from Dragon Dynasty, who released a two disc DVD of the film on 24 July 2007. A Blu-Ray version of the film was included {{as part of the}} Stranglehold Limited Edition for the PlayStation 3, and was later released as a standalone title by Dragon Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|After Lockdown on the April29 {{episode of}} Impact!, DOA Dusty Rhodes {{announced}} that A.J. Styles would face Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Hard Justice with Tito Ortiz as the Special Guest Referee. Styles went on <b>to</b> <b>Hard</b> Justice to defeat Jarrett {{and win the}} championship. Styles held the title until TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June19, where he lost the title in a five-man King of the Mountain match to Raven, which also involved Abyss, Sean Waltman, and Monty Brown. Raven continued his feud with Jeff Hardy following Lockdown. On the May13 episode of Impact!, {{it was announced that}} Raven would face Hardy in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match at Hard Justice. Hardy ended up not appearing at the event; Raven instead faced and defeated Waltman in the encounter. Raven then replaced Jarrett in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, where he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|After {{coming to}} power, Rajoelina's HAT pursued action against Ravalomanana and his {{business}} interests. On 2 June 2009, Ravalomanana was fined 70 million US dollars (42 million British pounds) and sentenced to four {{years in prison for}} alleged abuse of office which, according to HAT Justice Minister Christine Razanamahasoa, included the December 2008 purchase of a second presidential jet ("Air Force II") worth $60 million. Rajoelina sold the controversial jet in 2012 and pursued legal action against Ravalomanana's company Tiko to reclaim 35 million US dollars in back taxes. Additionally, on 28 August 2010, the HAT sentenced Ravalomanana in absentia <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> labor for life and issued an arrest warrant {{for his role in the}} protests and ensuing deaths. Rajoelina likewise sought to distinguish himself from his predecessor in policy choices. One of Rajoelina's first measures as president was to cancel Ravalomanana's unpopular deal with Daewoo Logistics. He also rejected Ravalomanana's medium term development strategy, termed the Madagascar Action Plan, and abandoned education reforms initiated by his predecessor that adopted Malagasy and English as languages of instruction, instead returning to the traditional use of French.|$|E

5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|The city {{authorities}} {{proceeded to}} punish severely {{the leaders of}} the Huttwil League. Bern did not accept the terms of the peace of Melligen with its amnesty, claiming the treaty was invalid on its territory, and cracked down hard on the rural population. The peasants were fined large sums and were made to cover the expenses for the military operations. The peace of the Murifeld was declared null and void by the Bernese city council, as was the Huttwil League. The rural population was disarmed. Many of the exponents of the movement were incarcerated, tortured, and finally sentenced to death or <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> labour on galleys, or exiled. Christian Schybi was executed at Sursee on July 9, 1653. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League. Punishment was hardest in the canton of Bern, where 23 death sentences were handed down and numerous other prominent peasants were executed in courts-martial by von Erlach's army, compared to eight and seven death sentences in Lucerne and Basel, respectively.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transition}} <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> courts after Wimbledon, Raonic made {{the quarterfinals of the}} Canadian Open, losing to Monfils, before falling to Murray {{for the fifth}} time in 2016 in the Cincinnati Masters semifinal. Raonic was the fifth seed at the US Open, but lost in the second round to Ryan Harrison, partly due to debilitating cramps. In September, cramps were cited as the reason for Raonic to miss Canada's Davis Cup tie against Chile. Later that month, Raonic failed to defend his title at the St. Petersburg Open, falling in his opening match to Youzhny. Raonic withdrew from the China Open prior to his semifinal match due to an ankle injury sustained in the quarterfinal. With the result, Raonic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the second time. Raonic suffered another injury, a quadriceps tear, during his quarterfinal match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Paris Masters and withdrew before his scheduled semifinal against Murray.|$|E

40|$|Many {{areas of}} science {{currently}} use computing resources as a {{important part of}} their research, and many research groups adopt cluster architecture to use them efficiently and manage them easily. Therefore, faulttolerance becomes a very important property for the computing resources. However, fault-tolerant systems have not yet been widely adopted because they are either <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> deploy, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> use, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> manage, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> maintain, or <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> justify. This paper proposes a practical fault-tolerant system for eScience infrastructures. Our system uses checkpoint/restart mechanism for fault-tolerance, and provides a easy mechanism to integrate with Grid services widely used in eScience. Additionally, we run rigorous tests using scientific applications to verify that our system can be used in clusters. We also describe improvements made to our system to solve various problems that arose when deploying it on a cluster. The experimental results show that not only does our system conform to various types of running environment well, but that it can also be practically deployed in clusters. ...|$|R
