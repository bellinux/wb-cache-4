5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Filming for series 3 {{began in}} November 2012, with an airing date {{scheduled}} for May 2013. In November Jones and Sharp were photographed filming {{on location in}} Manchester for the series. As the fourth series had a different air date (its television broadcast began in September, unlike May for the three previous series) it became the first series not to be filmed in the winter months. A longer break in production between series 3 and 4 was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fourth series was instead filmed in summer.|$|E

5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution.

5|$|The {{day of the}} National Flag of Armenia {{is marked}} on 15 June every year.

25|$|Orion's current name {{derives from}} Greek mythology, in which Orion was a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter of ancient times, born to Euryale, a Gorgon, and Poseidon (Neptune), {{god of the}} sea in the Graeco-Roman tradition. One myth recounts Gaia's rage at Orion, who dared {{to say that he}} would kill every animal on the planet. The angry goddess tried to {{dispatch}} Orion with a scorpion. This is given as <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> constellations of Scorpius and Orion are never in the sky at the same time. However, Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, revived Orion with an antidote. This is said to be <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> constellation of Ophiuchus stands midway between the Scorpion and the Hunter in the sky.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{supplements}} of nitric oxide, {{the response is}} short-lived because, as a normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism, increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance, which is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of sustained use of nitroglycerin for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> train {{stopped in}} North Platte {{was because the}} town was a {{designated}} tender point for steam trains. Stopping the train allowed for the train crews to relubricate the wheels, top off the water levels in the tanks, and other things for maintenance of the locomotive. This practice continued until the Union Pacific Railroad switched to diesel locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Bonfire {{night is}} a major annual celebration across the whole of England, but {{it is likely that}} <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> West Country Carnival was {{originally}} so keenly celebrated is that the South West towns were predominantly Protestant– hence the celebration of Robert Parsons' (and Guy Fawkes') failure. The religious origins of the event are almost forgotten and far less significant today.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UK flag is not {{symmetrical}} {{is because}} of the relative positions of the saltires of St Patrick and St Andrew.

25|$|The {{two main}} commentaries on the Mishnah are the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud. Neither work covers the whole Mishnah, but each work is on about 50–70% of the text. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Talmud {{is not usually}} viewed as a {{commentary}} on the Mishnah, is because it also has many other goals, and can get involved in long tangential discussions. However, {{the main purpose of}} the Talmud is as a commentary on the Mishnah.|$|E

25|$|When using {{fuel and}} oxygen tanks {{they should be}} {{fastened}} securely upright to a wall or a post or a portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oxygen is at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres) when full, and if the tank falls over and its valve strikes something and is knocked off, the tank will effectively become an extremely deadly flying missile propelled by the compressed oxygen, capable of even breaking through a brick wall.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} factor crucial to LRT is the train operator. Unlike rail rapid transit, which can travel unattended under {{automatic train operation}} (ATO), safe, high-quality LRT operation relies on a human operator as a key element. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> operator is so important is because the train tracks often share the streets with automobiles, other vehicles, and pedestrians. If trains were fully automated on roads, nobody would be there to stop the train if a car pulled in front of it. Light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety, and to reduce damage from impacts with cars.|$|E

Because of several free agent acquisitions, Vince Young, a back up quarterback, stated that the Eagles were a Dream Team.
