5|$|Copán was {{occupied}} {{for more than}} two thousand years, from the Early Preclassic period to the Postclassic.

5|$|In 1994, Shlomo Goren {{wrote that}} <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall as a Jewish prayer site was only 300 years old, the Jews being {{compelled}} to pray there after being forbidden to assemble on the mount itself.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably {{an indication of the}} antiquity of <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year {{contract}} {{to become the}} official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design would return to <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. The goal {{was to create a}} bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.|$|E
5|$|In September 1982, Bisanz {{organised}} two scouting {{training courses}} {{from which he}} selected a squad of 16 players. The team's first international match took place on 10 November 1982 in Koblenz. Following <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men’s team, Switzerland was chosen as West Germany's first opponent. Doris Kresimon scored the first international goal in the 25th minute. In the second half, 18-year-old Silvia Neid contributed two goals to the 5–1 victory; Neid later became the assistant coach in 1996 and the head coach in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 2nd century in North Africa, a {{distinctive}} type of nozzle tube shape was developed in <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terracotta tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of Morgantina, an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking terracotta pots for kiln roofs. This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Modifications and {{expansions}} {{on several}} traditional royal rituals under Andrianampoinimerina {{enabled him to}} develop a state religion {{in which he was}} the central figure. <b>The</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fandroana festival established by the 17th century Merina king Ralambo was made a much larger event intended to symbolically renew the nation and the cosmic power that legitimized and strengthened Andrianampoinimerina's reign as well as the power of the state.

5|$|The Southern Railway {{continued}} its 1923 naming policy for express passenger locomotives with this class.

5|$|The concerto delle donne {{revolutionized}} {{the role of}} women in professional music, and continued <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Este court as a musical center. Word of the ladies' ensemble spread across Italy, inspiring imitations in the powerful courts of the Medici and Orsini. The founding of the concerto delle donne was the most important event in secular Italian music in the late sixteenth century; the musical innovations established in the court were important in the development of the madrigal, and eventually the seconda pratica.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{that sits}} atop the Burnside Fountain is now {{commonly}} referred to as Turtle Boy. In <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manneken Pis in Brussels, Turtle Boy has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester. Much of the local popularity of the statue is due to bawdy insinuations about how the boy and the turtle are portrayed. Anonymous members of the Worcester community sometimes dress the statue in festive clothes for holidays, local bands write crowd-pleasing songs about it, and the statue has even graced postcards of the city.|$|E

5|$|Varner's In Nature's Interests? {{offers a}} {{resolution}} of the debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based biocentric individualism according to which all living beings—including plants—have morally significant interests that ground prima facie (though overridable) duties. The approach follows in <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear utilitarian commitments.|$|E
5|$|William Etty, {{the son of}} a York {{baker and}} miller, began as an {{apprentice}} printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London at the age of 18, with the intention of becoming a history painter in <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Masters. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he submitted paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited.|$|E
5|$|William III {{commissioned}} Nicholas Hawksmoor and Sir Christopher Wren {{to conduct}} a large, final classical remodelling of the Upper Ward, but the king's early death caused the plan to be cancelled.

Anne also created the racecourse at Ascot and began <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annual Royal Ascot procession from the castle.|$|E

5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maasai and the Hadza, corpses {{are left in}} the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse {{rejected}} by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon}} for bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} source of symbolism on memorials, however, is Christian imagery and icons. Religious imagery permeated many war memorials, even the secular. The {{most important of these}} symbols was the Christian cross, a widely used symbol of hope and suffering. The cross could take multiple forms, from Catholic designs in France, to Orthodox crosses in eastern Europe. Celtic crosses were popular in Britain and Ireland, partially because they avoided Catholic connotations, although they were considered vulgar by more classical architects such as Blomfield. In France, les croix des bois, wooden crosses, became popular symbols at memorials after Roland Dorgelès's novel of the same name. German memorials made extensive use of the image of the Virgin Mary tending her son Christ, following in <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pietà. The crucifixion was also a widely used symbol, as seen in Derwent Wood's Canada's Golgotha, although Christ himself was relatively rarely typically seen on British memorials.|$|E
5|$|Concurrent {{with his}} {{political}} career, Slaughter took {{a leading role}} in the affairs of his church. He was born into <b>the</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church of England, but soon became associated with the Baptist congregation at Shawnee Run. He served as a messenger from this congregation to the various associations with which it was connected for over thirty years. One such association was the South District Association; Slaughter served as clerk at that body's annual meeting in 1808 and 1809, and later served as its moderator for nine years. In 1813, he helped found the Kentucky Bible Society.|$|E
