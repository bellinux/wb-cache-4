5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1890 as Tow Law F.C., before adding the Town to their name in 1905, and {{throughout}} their history they have played {{in a number of}} local leagues including the Auckland and District League, the South Durham Alliance and <b>the</b> <b>Crook</b> and District League, before joining the Northern League in 1920. They have won the Northern League's Division Two twice—in 1988 and 1992—and its Division One on three occasions—in 1924, 1925 and 1995—but they have never been promoted or demoted from the Northern League since joining it more than 90 years ago.

5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. <b>The</b> <b>crook</b> of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{football}} team operating in Tow Law as early as 1881, when a vicar captained the team. However, the club still playing today was founded as Tow Law in 1890. The club {{became one of the}} founding teams of the Auckland and District League in 1892, and won the Durham Amateur Cup the following year. They then joined the Northern League in 1894. In 1896 they won the Durham Challenge Cup. They left the Northern League, and played in the South Durham Alliance from 1900 to 1905. In 1905 the club changed its name to Tow Law Town which they have stuck with ever since. The club played in <b>the</b> <b>Crook</b> and District League from 1912 until 1914. After the end of World War I in 1918, the club again played in the Auckland and District League until 1920, when they returned to the Northern League where they have played ever since. The club were league winners two seasons in a row, in 1923–24 and 1924–25. They were runners up in 1928–29. In the Second World War they resigned from the Northern League on 20 March 1940 and their record of the season was deleted. They rejoined the league in 1945 on its resumption after the War.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{maintained}} {{that the right to}} wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, Liturgische Gewandung, p.453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which Alexander II in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of Abingdon, St Alban's, Bardney, Battle, Bury St Edmunds, St Augustine's Canterbury, Colchester, Croyland, Evesham, Glastonbury, Gloucester, St Benet's Hulme, Hyde, Malmesbury, Peterborough, Ramsey, Reading, Selby, Shrewsbury, Tavistock, Thorney, Westminster, Winchcombe, and St Mary's York. Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 Adrian IV (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster and then Ramsey. Elsewhere, the mitred abbots that sat in the Estates of Scotland were of Arbroath, Cambuskenneth, Coupar Angus, Dunfermline, Holyrood, Iona, Kelso, Kilwinning, Kinloss, Lindores, Paisley, Melrose, Scone, St Andrews Priory and Sweetheart. To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> of their pastoral staff (the crosier) should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.|$|E
500|$|Capella {{is thought}} to be {{mentioned}} in an Akkadian inscription dating to the 20th century BC.

The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. It is sometimes called the Shepherd's Star in English literature.

2500|$|An {{exception}} to the law on misrepresentation – that contracts are voidable at the instance of the misrepresentee, but the right to rescission can be barred inter alia by the intervention of third party rights – arises when someone is induced by the fraudulent misrepresentation to enter an agreement through a written document at a distance (and not when a transaction is face to face). In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson a crook obtained Mr Patel's credit details and bought a Mitsubishi Shogun on hire purchase contract at a car dealer. Shogun Finance was faxed through Mr Patel's details, and agreed to finance {{the purchase of the}} car, letting <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> drive away. Subsequently, Mrs Hudson bought the car from <b>the</b> <b>crook.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crook</b> disappeared. Then Shogun Finance, who had predictably never been paid, found Mrs Hudson and sued to retrieve the car. A bare majority in the House of Lords held that to protect the certainty of commercial dealings through a signed document, the contract between the finance company and <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> was void (the same consequence as if there had never been any offer mirrored by an acceptance). They had only ever intended to contract with Mr Patel. And because nobody can convey property they do not have (nemo dat quod non habet) Mrs Hudson never acquired legitimate title to the car from <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> and had to give back the car. The minority held that this situation should follow ordinary law of misrepresentation, and should mean that the right of the finance company to rescind the contract would be barred by the intervention of Mrs Hudson's rights as a bona fide third party purchaser, just like all of Europe, the United States, and previous decisions of the Court of Appeal suggest.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Over {{the last}} decade, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has {{documented}} a precipitous decline in <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) population, prompting {{this study to}} address potential factors contributing to the decline. There are two main goals to this project: (1) identify potential factors contributing to {{the reduction of the}} redband trout population in <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River fishery and (2) provide management recommendations to all of the agencies responsible for managing <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River that might effect a change in the redband trout population trend. This thesis had three objectives: (1) evaluate the movement patterns of redband trout and mountain whitefish in <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam, (2) monitor total dissolved gas levels (TDG) in <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River to evaluate the incidence of supersaturated water and gas bubble disease in redband trout and mountain whitefish and (3) implement a more comprehensive population estimate survey to document both redband trout and mountain whitefish population densities. Prior to this study, limited data existed on the distribution and movement patterns of redband trout and mountain whitefish in <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam. Based on the results from the 2 -year telemetry study, redband trout and mountain whitefish population exhibit a resident life history strategy and stay in the Wild and Scenic Section of <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam. Two potential explanations for the observed population decline were plausible: the decline was actually a decline, or the fish moved to other sections of <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River downstream of Bowman Dam. The telemetery study showed that redband trout and mountain whitefish stay within this section of river, thereby providing evidence against the explanation that the observed population decline was a result of movement of fish to other sections of river. The total dissolved gas study demonstrated that gas saturation levels become elevated enough to cause gas bubble disease in <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River below Bowman Dam. The gas saturation in <b>the</b> <b>Crooked</b> River is equivalent or higher than levels shown to produce gas bubble disease (GBD) in fishes. When flows exceed 600 cfs, the total dissolved gas saturation exceeds the maximum Oregon Department of Environmental Quality mandated level of 110...|$|R
