2500|$|Stalin did {{not know}} that Hitler had been {{secretly}} discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since summer 1940, [...] and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the East regardless of the parties talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis Power. [...] He had ignored German economic naysayers, and told Hermann Göring [...] "that everyone on all sides was always raising economic misgivings against a threatening war with Russia. From now onwards he wasn't going to listen to any more of that kind of talk and from now on he was going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> his ears in order to get his peace of mind." [...] This was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had been preparing reports on the negative economic consequences of a Soviet invasion—that it would be a net economic drain unless it was captured intact. Given Hitler's latest demands regarding negative advice, Thomas revised his report. [...] Reich Finance Minister Schwerin-Krosigk also opposed an invasion, arguing that Germany would lose grain because of Soviet scorched-earth policies, lack of effective Soviet transport and the loss of production labor with a German attack in the East. [...] Schnurre agreed with the economic loss assessment.|$|E

6000|$|... “Neither the New York nor the Brooklyn <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> couple <b>up</b> their forward engines, but {{ran out of}} {{the chase}} with one pair, getting steam, of course, as rapidly as {{possible}} on all boilers. <b>To</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> couple <b>up</b> the forward engines would have meant a delay of fifteen minutes, or four miles in the chase.|$|R

60|$|At length, Jonas {{said that}} he had got the leather all nailed on, and they might try the experiment. He took hold of the nose of the bellows, and held his thumb near the end of it, ready <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> the hole.|$|E
60|$|Then he puts two dainty {{little white}} figures, bending, on each flank, <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> his corners. But {{he puts the}} taller inside on the right, and outside on the left.

6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} {{anything}} about it, father," [...] she answered, [...] "and as for Beatrice's looks they are a matter of opinion. I have mine. And now don't you think we had better go to bed? The doctors and Betty are going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> all night with Mr. Bingham and Beatrice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First," [...] said Jonas, [...] "you, Rollo, {{may take}} hold of {{the nose of the}} bellows with your hand, {{in such a way as}} to put your thumb over the end of it, <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> it <b>up,</b> and then let Nathan try to blow." ...|$|R

50|$|The area {{currently}} {{occupied by}} the bus station {{used to be a}} Total Garage. Services that used to terminate at Malin Bridge and Forbes Road were diverted into the Interchange, and services that used <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> farther <b>up</b> the road by Hillsborough Barracks near the old Officer Mess building (now the headquarters for Sheffield Insulations Ltd) were changed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at the Interchange.|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Grant rose. [...] "In {{this matter}} of Penalva, I will {{consider}} further. But I {{do not think}} there is anything to be done now. The main thing is <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> the outlets through which information reaches the French, and that is my chief concern. How is the stripping of the country proceeding now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{the devil}} {{business}} has he <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> so late!' muttered Sim, passing into the workshop, and setting it {{down upon the}} forge. 'Here's half the night gone already. There's only one good that has ever come to me, out of this cursed old rusty mechanical trade, and that's this piece of ironmongery, upon my soul!' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the heat}} of action, amid the {{whirling}} loop of bawling calves and cows, when the dry dust rose <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> Pan's nostrils and cake on his hot sweaty face, when the ropes were whistling, the cowboys yelling, the brand iron sizzling, all he felt was the wild delight of it, {{the thrill of the}} risk, the excitement, the constant stirring life and motion. During leisure hours, however, he was always confronted with his lack of rider's equipment.|$|E
6000|$|Const. We {{have a right}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> it <b>up,</b> and our {{own safety}} obliges [...] us to it; besides, {{this is not the}} King's highway, it is a way upon [...] sufferance. You see here is a gate, and if we do let people pass [...] here, we make them pay toll.|$|R
60|$|Erling {{told the}} rower <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> and, glancing <b>up,</b> beheld the stern yet good-humoured visage of his bluff friend {{looking over the}} rows of bright shields that hung on the bulwarks.|$|R
5000|$|The true {{definition}} of the term derives from the practice of a small, only occasionally used railway station of signaling a train by steam whistle so the engineer will know <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> pick <b>up</b> a passenger. Therefore, the first usage of the term in the political context, by Robert A. Taft, was derisive. He accused then President Harry S Truman of [...] "blackguarding Congress at whistle stops across the country".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that would}} be awkward. However, if they do, we must keep the men below, and in the {{meantime}} you had better get your carpenter to cut up some spars and make a lot of plugs in readiness <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> any holes they make near the water-line. I don't think they are likely to make very ragged holes, the wood is so rotten the shot would go through the side as if it were brown paper; still, you might get a lot of squares of canvas ready, with hammers and nails." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{child was}} put to bed upstairs at seven o'clock, {{although}} he in vain petitioned to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> until the barge came along. He already knew, however, by experience, that his request was {{not likely to be}} granted, as when the barge came along after dark he was always put to bed, the woman telling him that Bill didn't like him to be up when he came in, as he wanted to have a talk with her in quiet, and to eat his supper in peace.|$|E
60|$|By nightfall the exertions of Dan, Lucy, and Chloe {{had made}} the house tidy. Beds of rushes and grass {{had been made in}} the room upstairs for the women, and Dan had no {{occasion}} for one for himself, as he was going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> with his master. He, however, brought a bundle of rushes into the kitchen, and when it became dark threw himself down upon them for a few hours' sleep, Lucy and her old nurse taking their place in Vincent's room and promising to rouse Dan at twelve o'clock.|$|E

6000|$|Jones found {{sleeping}} in the cabin, despite the fire, uncomfortably cold, because of the wide chinks between the logs. It was hardly better than sleeping under the swaying spruces. When he essayed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> the crack, a task by no means easy, considering the lack of material--Rea laughed his short [...] "Ho! Ho!" [...] and stopped him with the word, [...] "Wait." [...] Every morning the green ice extended farther out into the lake; the sun paled dim and dimmer; the nights grew colder. On October 8th the thermometer registered several degrees below zero; it fell a little more next night and continued to fall.|$|E
60|$|That evening Beric {{had a long}} {{talk with}} Aska and four or five men from the coast {{accustomed}} to the building of large boats. The matter would be easy enough, they said, as the boats would {{not be required to}} withstand the strain of the sea, and needed only to be put together with flat bottoms and sides. With so large a number of men they could hew down trees of suitable size, and thin them down until they obtained a plank from each. They would then be fastened together by strong pegs and dried moss driven in between the crevices. Pitch, however, would be required <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> the seams, and of this they had none.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not exactly, Fred,' {{replied the}} imperturbable Richard, {{continuing}} to write with a businesslike air. 'I enter {{in this little}} book {{the names of the}} streets that I can't go down while the shops are open. This dinner today closes Long Acre. I bought a pair of boots in Great Queen Street last week, and made that no throughfare too. There's only one avenue to the Strand left often now, and I shall have <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> that to-night with a pair of gloves. The roads are closing so fast in every direction, that in a month's time, unless my aunt sends me a remittance, I shall have to go three or four miles out of town to get over the way.' ...|$|E
50|$|The heavy {{loss was}} {{in part due to}} a {{flotilla}} of seven empty LCI(L) (Landing Craft Infantry (Large)) craft failing <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> pick <b>up</b> survivors, for which the commanding officer was relieved of his command. However, 606 survivors were rescued by the minesweeper USS Pioneer (AM-105). The loss was so devastating that it was classified until 1967. The full details were only released following the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act.|$|R

6000|$|... 'On, on, my friends!' {{and away}} we flew, {{striking}} {{fire from the}} cobblestones of the little town. A gendarme tried <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up,</b> but his voice was drowned by our rattle and clatter. The houses slid past, and we {{were out on the}} country road again, with a clear twenty miles between ourselves and Paris. How could they escape us, with the finest horses in France behind them? Not one of the three had turned a hair, but Violette was always a head and shoulders to the front. She was going within herself too, and I knew by the spring of her that I had only to let her stretch herself, and the Emperor's horses would see the colour of her tail.|$|E
6000|$|Ernest {{smiled a}} broad smile at her delicious simplicity. 'If by very great people you mean rich,' he said, 'we couldn't very well be poorer--for people of our sort, I mean. My mother lives almost entirely on her pension; and we boys have only {{been able to come}} up to Oxford, just as Harry was, by the aid of our scholarships. If we hadn't saved in our first two years, while we had our {{government}} allowances, we shouldn't have been able <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> for our degrees at all. So if I don't get a fellowship I shall have to take to school-mastering or something of the sort, for a livelihood. Indeed, this at Pembroke will be my very last chance, for I can't hold on much longer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Marion had, {{after the}} first greeting, leapt lightly from the boat and run up to the house, towards which the others {{proceeded}} at a more leisurely pace, stopping often and looking round at the pleasant prospect. Marion was full of questions to Wilfrid when they arrived. Why were the walls made so thick? How were they going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> the crevices between the logs? Where were the windows and doors coming from? What was the roof {{going to be made}} of? Was there going to be a floor, or was the ground inside going to be raised {{to the level of the}} door-sill? When did he expect to get it finished, and when would they be ready to come in? Couldn't they get some creepers to run up and hide these ugly logs? Was it to be painted or to remain as it was? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{followed}} my advice, first, however, <b>stopping</b> <b>to</b> pick <b>up</b> several {{things he had}} dropped or that {{had been taken from}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{stepped into}} the rooms, this morning, with the others, but merely glanced around a bit,” said Mr. Merrick. “I’ve an idea you may {{rightfully}} claim whatever is there. The value of such old, odd pieces is arbitrary and they wouldn’t total enough at an auction sale to bother about. My idea, Arthur, is that you remove whatever you care <b>to</b> retain, <b>stop</b> <b>up</b> the rat holes, and then seal up the place forever.” ...|$|R
50|$|Stations in {{a railway}} system, and where train are {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> pick <b>up</b> or drop off passengers, serves {{to reduce the}} route capacity. This is particularly the case where trains of different stopping patterns are moving one after another through a rail system. Dwell time, known as layover in the US, is the time taken from the opening of train doors at a station, to their closing again. Dwell times strongly influence route capacity in a rail system.|$|R
