5|$|A script {{book for}} The Quatermass Experiment, {{including}} some {{photographs from the}} production, was released by Penguin Books in 1959. This was followed by similar releases of Quatermass II and Quatermass and the Pit, both published in 1960.

5|$|A script book of Quatermass and the Pit was {{released}} by Penguin Books in April 1960, with a cover by Kneale's artist brother Bryan Kneale. In 1979 this was re-published by Arrow Books {{to coincide with the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth and final Quatermass serial on ITV; this edition featured a new introduction by Kneale. The theatrical company Creation Productions staged a live adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit in a quarry near Nottingham in August 1997.|$|E
5|$|A serialised {{novelisation}} of Quatermass II, {{written by}} Kneale, {{ran in the}} Daily Express newspaper in the UK from 5 December to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper lost interest in the project. The television scripts were released by Penguin Books in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included. The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, {{to coincide with the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thames Television serial.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influence}} of the Liao cultural tradition {{is seen in the}} Yuan dynasty's zaju (杂剧) theater, its associated orchestration, and the qu (曲) and sanqu (散曲) forms of Classical Chinese poetry. One documented way in which this influence occurred was through the incorporation of Khitan officers and men into the service of the Mongol forces during the first Mongol invasion of 1211 to 1215. This northern route of cultural <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legacy of Liao culture was then returned to China during the Yuan dynasty.|$|E

30|$|In the {{approach}} in [2 – 4], the AP centrally coordinates the ACK or NACK frame <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipients by transmitting the RAK (Request for ACK) or RNAK (Request for NACK) polling frames to the recipients. For example, {{according to the}} BMMM (Batch Mode Multicast MAC) protocol in [3], the AP coordinates the ACK frame transmissions by transmitting the separate RAK frames to the recipients. In {{the approach}} in [5], the AP reserves the wireless channel for <b>the</b> ACK frame <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipients and coordinates <b>the</b> ACK frame <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipients in a strictly sequential order. For the channel reservation for the ACK frame transmissions, {{it is assumed that}} the AP knows each ACK frame transmission time beforehand. However, this assumption cannot be realized generally because the STAs can choose their ACK transmission rates differently according to the wireless channel state. Other approaches in [2, 4, 6 – 8] not based on the AP's polling have also been proposed for the reliable multicast transmission.|$|R
5|$|By {{means of}} the sodium-potassium pump, living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in {{exchange}} for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nerve impulse—an action potential—when the charge is dissipated; sodium {{plays a key role}} in that activity.|$|E
5|$|Classic TV Press {{published}} the book Worlds Apart: an unofficial and unauthorised {{guide to the}} BBC's remake of Survivors (March 2010), written by Rich Cross, shortly after <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second series completes. The book incorporates: in depth synopses and reviews for all the episodes from Series 1 and 2; insights into {{the making of the}} series; examination of the similarities and differences between the new series and the 1970s series; a photographic guide to filming locations; and exclusive production shots.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E

5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{breakthroughs}} in virology were made {{while he was}} there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influenza virus. His own research was on the canarypox virus, which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined {{and returned to the}} Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.|$|E
25|$|It was to {{be another}} ten years before {{reception}} improved. In 1939, the BBC investigated using Start Point transmitting station in Devon to improve their coverage <b>of</b> radio in <b>the</b> South West. However, due to <b>the</b> outbreak <b>of</b> World War II, <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC Home Service did not start here until 1945. Another medium wave transmitter, Lanner/Redruth MF, in <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county, was built in 1943 by German POWs. This started <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC Home Service immediately, as unlike the transmitter at Start Point, {{it was felt that}} the signal could not be picked up by the Germans.|$|R
