25|$|A {{lava flow}} is a moving outpouring of lava created during a non-explosive effusive eruption. When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock. The term lava flow is {{commonly}} shortened to lava. Although lava can {{be up to}} 100,000 times more viscous than water, lava can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its <b>thixotropic</b> and shear thinning properties.|$|E
25|$|The Space Pen, {{also known}} as the Zero Gravity Pen, is a pen that uses {{pressurized}} ink cartridges and is claimed to write in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in extreme temperature ranges. The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The <b>thixotropic</b> ink in the hermetically sealed and pressurized reservoir is claimed to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen. In 1965, the space pen was invented and patented by Paul C. Fisher. After two years of testing at NASA, the space pen was first used during the Apollo 7 mission in 1968.|$|E

If a fluid does not obey this relation, it is termed a non-Newtonian fluid, {{of which there are}} several types. Non-Newtonian fluids can be either plastic, Bingham plastic, pseudoplastic, dilatant, <b>thixotropic,</b> rheopectic, viscoelastic.|$|E
2500|$|As ketchup {{has high}} {{viscosity}} and behaves as a pseudoplastic or <b>thixotropic</b> liquid, dispensing from glass bottles can be difficult. Tapping the glass bottle causes the ketchup to become thinner {{and easier to}} pour. Heinz suggests, on its website, that {{the best place to}} tap the bottle is on the [...] "57" [...] mark. [...] The New York Times has also claimed that the tapping the [...] "57" [...] mark {{is the best way to}} cause Heinz ketchup to pour smoothly. Shaking the bottle or tapping in another place is also effective, however.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as <b>thixotropic.</b> This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E
50|$|Sour cream {{exhibits}} time-dependent <b>thixotropic</b> behaviors. <b>Thixotropic</b> fluids reduce in viscosity as work {{is applied}} {{and when the}} product is no longer under stress, the fluid returns to its previous viscosity. The viscosity of sour cream at room temperature is 100,000 cP, (for comparison: water has a viscosity of 1 cP at 20 °C). The <b>thixotropic</b> properties exhibited by sour cream are what make it such a versatile product in the food industry.|$|E
50|$|A <b>thixotropic</b> fluid is best visualised by an oar blade {{embedded}} in mud. Pressure on the oar {{often results in}} a highly viscous (more solid) <b>thixotropic</b> mud on the high pressure side of the blade, and low viscosity (very fluid) <b>thixotropic</b> mud on the low pressure side of the oar blade. Flow from the high pressure side to the low pressure side of the oar blade is non-Newtonian. (i.e.: fluid velocity is not linearly proportional to the square root of the pressure differential over the oar blade).|$|E

50|$|<b>Thixotropic</b> fluids are fluids {{that show}} a shear {{thinning}} property. Certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under static conditions will flow (become thin, less viscous) over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed. They {{then take a}} fixed time {{to return to a}} more viscous state. In more technical language: some non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. A <b>thixotropic</b> fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Some <b>thixotropic</b> fluids return to a gel state almost instantly, such as ketchup, and are called pseudoplastic fluids. Others such as yogurt take much longer and can become nearly solid. Many gels and colloids are <b>thixotropic</b> materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated.|$|E

5000|$|Solder paste is <b>thixotropic,</b> {{meaning that}} its {{viscosity}} {{changes over time}} with applied shear force (e.g., stirring). The <b>thixotropic</b> index {{is a measure of}} the viscosity of the solder paste at rest, compared to [...] "worked" [...] paste. Depending upon the formulation of the paste, it may be very important to stir the paste before it is used, to ensure that the viscosity is appropriate for proper application.|$|E
50|$|Some authors {{consider}} shear-thinning to be {{a special}} case of <b>thixotropic</b> behaviour, because {{the recovery of the}} microstructure of the liquid to its initial state will always require a non-zero time. When the recovery of viscosity after disturbance is very rapid however, the observed behaviour is classic shear-thinning or pseudoplasticity, because as soon as the shear is removed, the viscosity returns to normal. When it takes a measurable time for the viscosity to recover, <b>thixotropic</b> behaviour is observed. When describing the viscosity of liquids, however, it is therefore useful to distinguish shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) behaviour from <b>thixotropic</b> behaviour, where the viscosity at all shear rates is decreased for some duration after agitation: both of these effects can often be seen separately in the same liquid.|$|E

It is very <b>thixotropic</b> above 1% concentration, but below 0.3%, the thixotropy is slight. Guar gum shows viscosity synergy with xanthan gum.

50|$|Though cooked custard is a weak gel, viscous and <b>thixotropic,</b> a {{suspension}} of uncooked custard powder (starch) in water, {{with the proper}} proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative <b>thixotropic,</b> or dilatant, {{which is to say}} that it becomes more viscous when under pressure. This suspension is termed oobleck and often used in science demonstrations of non-Newtonian fluids.
