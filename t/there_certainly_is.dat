25|$|In theory it is {{possible}} for a lowly local amateur club to rise to the pinnacle of the English game and become champions of the Premier League. While this may be unlikely in practice (at the very least, in the short run), <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> significant movement within the pyramid.|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} really amazing quality in 'Paparazzi', where {{it kind of}} had this pure pop music quality {{but at the same}} time it was a {{commentary}} on fame culture... I wanted to do the same thing with this video... <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a Tarantino-inspired quality in the [...] video... His direct involvement in [...] came from him lending me the Pussy Wagon. We were having lunch one day in Los Angeles and I was telling him about my concept for the video and he loved it so much he said, [...] "You gotta use the Pussy Wagon." ...|$|E
6000|$|SURFACE. Well <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> no {{knowing what}} men are capable of-- no--there is no knowing--yet I can't but think Lady Teazle herself {{has too much}} Principle---- ...|$|E
60|$|And {{from that}} time <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a {{different}} tone and spirit in Eleanor.|$|R
60|$|It is {{probably}} {{that very few}} of you, if any, ever saw a fish's nest; but <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> such things.|$|R
6000|$|... "One shot?" [...] said Ingleby, with {{a little}} smile. [...] "The {{corporal}} heard two, both close together, and <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, it's {{wonderful}} how {{you guess}} things, Marty," [...] said the barber. [...] "I've had it from them that know that <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> some foreign gentleman in her eye. However, mind what I ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, I {{thought it}} rather subtle," [...] Jacob observed. [...] "You see, I am {{supposed}} to know all about oil, although I really know no more about it than {{the man in the}} moon. And <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> oil in Trinidad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Eh?' said Brass, {{holding his}} head on one side, and {{throwing}} it a little back, as connoisseurs do. 'Now I look at it again, I fancy I see a--yes, <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> something in the smile that reminds me of--and yet upon my word I--' ...|$|E
5000|$|The name of Deycimont {{has been}} known since 1232 but <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> some houses in the Antiquity, because old Celtic and Roman coins have been found. The name of the town could mean [...] "Decius Mountain".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! He'd bought land,' said Mark, {{shaking his}} head, 'and {{paid for it}} too. Every sort of nateral {{advantage}} was connected with it, the agents said; and <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> ONE, quite unlimited. No end to the water!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> {{some things}} against us. Even when the chance was given us to sell {{all we had}} {{and give it to}} the poor, we couldn't bring our minds to it, and went away {{exceeding}} sorrowful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say, Mr Lynch, {{whether she}} is or no; but it's certain the fever has left her. She's very weak, very weak indeed; I never knew {{a person to}} be alive and have less life in 'em; but the fever has left her and <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must first}} observe, children," [...] said he, [...] "that some writers deny {{the truth of}} the {{incident}} which I am about to relate to you. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> but little evidence in favor of it. Other respectable writers, however, tell it for a fact; and, at all events, it is an interesting story, and has an excellent moral." ...|$|E
60|$|I did so, and if {{you have}} heard from my father accordingly, you know more, probably, about the subject of this letter than I who write it. But if you have not, then shall I have {{discharged}} a friend's duty, in letting you know that <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> something afloat between this disagreeable laird and my father, in which you are considerably interested.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> {{passages}} of stark horror, but 'Gun Buster' {{does not make}} them too long. His is a book In which discomfort, tragedy and brutality Is stepped down, and the' spirit of the troope shines through the brighter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Harry," [...] cried Hamilton, [...] "you {{are taking}} the very worst view of it. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> plenty of such {{outposts}} in the country, but {{you know very well}} that young fellows like you are seldom sent to such places." ...|$|R
60|$|Several of them {{gathered}} round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted, {{also the}} other indoor milkmaids, {{one or two}} of the milking-men, and last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a twang.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Especially as we know,' said Fanny, 'that <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a tone in {{the place}} to which you have been so true, which does belong to it, and which does make it {{different}} from other aspects of Society. So kiss me once again, Amy dear, and we will agree that we may both be right, and {{that you are a}} tranquil, domestic, home-loving, good girl.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> {{at least}} one French frigate in the bay of Hayti, and if she has {{received}} the news she is quite likely to endeavour {{to pick up some}} prizes before it is generally known, just as the Spartane picked up those merchantmen, and though possibly we might beat her off, I should very much prefer to be let alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the general}} views, then, which are {{presented}} {{in the writings of}} [...] Swedenborg on the subject of Heaven and Hell, as the abodes, [...] respectively, of happiness and of misery, while <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not [...] anything which is not in the highest degree agreeable both to reason [...] and Scripture, there also seems nothing which could be deemed [...] inconsistent with the usual conceptions of the Christian world.|$|E
60|$|The {{upshot of}} his {{thoughts}} <b>was</b> this, that <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not room in the diocese for the energies of both himself and Mrs. Proudie, and that it behoved him quickly to ascertain whether his energies or hers were to prevail.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> Lady Casterley, {{standing}} a little {{back from the}} drive, and directing a tall gardener {{how to deal with}} an old oak-tree. Courtier alighted, and went towards her to say good-bye. She greeted him with a certain grim cordiality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{he was the}} chap who {{was walking}} {{backwards}} and forwards with the General when the band was playing yesterday evening. Several of the men remarked how like he was to you, Sanderson. I noticed it, too. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a strong likeness." ...|$|R
6000|$|Grace halted, {{and turned}} the cold steel of her proud eyes on the two men. As they rested on Rushbrook they quivered slightly. [...] "I can already bear witness," [...] she said coldly, [...] "to the {{generosity}} of Mr. Rushbrook in a matter which then touched me. But <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> no necessity for him to show it now in a matter in which I have not the slightest concern." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great {{men should}} think of Opportunity, {{and not of}} Time. Time is the excuse of feeble and puzzled spirits. They make time the {{sleeping}} partner of their lives to accomplish {{what ought to be}} achieved by their own will. In this case, <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> no time like the present. The opportunity is unrivalled. All your friends would, without an exception, be delighted if you now were wise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In one respect, <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a difference. In marriage, {{the man is}} {{supposed}} {{to provide for the}} support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile. But in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, the compliance are expected from him, while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water. That, I suppose, was the difference of duties which struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison." ...|$|E
60|$|Thora tossed up {{her head}} a little and muttered {{something}} about not being mewed {{out of sight and}} speech of all men. And when she attended her lady to the hall <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> glances between her and a slim young archer.|$|R
30|$|However, <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> exceptions. For example, Rockoff (2009) reviews {{rigorous}} {{studies on}} class size from the 1920 s and 1930 s. Although {{this research was}} not always {{on a large scale}} or sophisticated by modern standards, it did aim to produce causal estimates.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> Ellen! Like {{a man on}} his way to prison, Alfred Burton {{took his}} place in a third-class {{carriage}} in his customary train to Garden Green. Ned Miles, who travelled in the oil trade, came up and smote him upon the shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have {{a prosperous}} look. It's {{a funny thing}} about England. I've known you four months, and I know men who know you; but I've never heard a word about your finances. In New York we all wear labels, stating our incomes and {{prospects}} in clear lettering. Well, if it's like that it's different, of course. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> more {{money to be made}} in America than here. I don't quite see what you think you're going to do when you get there, but that's up to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Darn it!" [...] he mourned. [...] "Oh well, I suppose I'll hit a cigar {{once in a}} while. And--Be a great {{convenience}} {{for other}} folks. Might make just the difference in getting chummy with some fellow that would put over a sale. And--Certainly looks nice <b>there.</b> <b>Certainly</b> <b>is</b> a mighty clever little jigger. Gives the last touch of refinement and class. I--By golly, I guess I can afford it if I want to! Not {{going to be the}} only member of this family that never has a single doggone luxury!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>THERE</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a dark {{delight in}} being miserable, {{a sort of}} strange {{satisfaction}} in being savage, which is uncommonly fascinating. One of the greatest pests of philosophy is, that one {{can no longer be}} sullen, and most sincerely do I regret it. To brood over misery, to flatter yourself {{that there is not a}} single being who cares for your existence, and not a single circumstance to make that existence desirable: there is wild witchery in it, which we doubt whether opium can reach, and are sure that wine cannot.|$|E
60|$|There {{was indeed}} {{no doubt that}} the nags had made {{their way out of the}} stables, in that irresponsible fashion {{peculiar}} to animals, and that they had gone astray in the dark. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> no sound in the night to denote their presence anywhere near.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Hearts' {{return to}} the stage {{was always going to}} <b>be</b> special and <b>there</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> magic in the air as Donal Lunny, Davy Spillane, Eoghan O'Neill, Keith Donald, Matt Kellaghan, Noel Eccles, Anto Drennan and Graham Henderson took to the stage for the first of a four night stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Italy is {{primarily}} associated with ices," [...] remarked Mr. Horne Fisher. [...] "I mean {{with ice cream}} men. Most {{people in this country}} imagine that Italy is entirely populated with ice cream men and organ grinders. <b>There</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> a lot of them; perhaps they're an invading army in disguise." ...|$|R
