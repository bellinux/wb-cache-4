5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of <b>the</b> <b>jewels,</b> claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep <b>the</b> <b>jewels,</b> but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the {{instructions on how to}} deal with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for <b>the</b> <b>jewels.</b> The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, <b>the</b> <b>Jewels</b> went {{on public}} {{display in the}} Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, <b>the</b> <b>Jewels</b> have been protected by armed guards.|$|E

If <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> carrier is fireballed on a bridge, <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> stays on <b>the</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|As repentance for {{his having}} fought Krishna, Jambavan gave Krishna <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> and also his {{daughter}} Jambavati in marriage. Krishna returned <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> to Satrajit, {{who in turn}} apologized for his false accusation. He promptly offered to give Krishna <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> and his three daughters Satyabhama, Vratini and Prasvapini in marriage. Krishna accepted them but refused <b>the</b> <b>jewel.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Jewelpet Sunshine, <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Pod {{retains its}} {{usefulness}} as a magical item {{for the students}} of Sunshine Academy, even for Jewelpets. <b>The</b> <b>Jewel</b> Pod {{is used as a}} normal smartphone as well as casting magic. <b>The</b> <b>Jewel</b> Pod can become its upgraded form, called <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Pod Crystal (Jueru Poddo Kurisutaru), which allows the Jewelpets to do powerful magic.|$|R
5|$|The {{marriage}} was unhappy from the start. A few nights following the formal entry, Marguerite Louise demanded the Tuscan crown jewels {{for her own}} personal use; Cosimo refused. <b>The</b> <b>jewels</b> that she did manage to extract from Cosimo were almost smuggled out of Tuscany by her attendants but for the efforts of Ferdinando's agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} a {{distinct}} royal jewel collection is vague, {{though it is}} believed <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> have their origin somewhere in the 16thcentury. Many of the pieces are from overseas and {{were brought to the}} United Kingdom as a result of civil war, coups and revolutions, or acquired as gifts to the monarch. Most of the jewellery dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|After Laser Wizard, Bufo, Forest Wizard, and—unwittingly—Ice King help a {{being named}} Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City, it reveals {{itself to be}} a {{creature}} of pure anti-magic. As such, <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> from Ice King's crown are stripped of their magic, and Ice King reverts to his former self: Simon Petrikov (both voiced by Tom Kenny). Simon, initially unaware of where he is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by Steve Agee), flies to the Ice Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E
50|$|The Master of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Office was a {{position}} in the Royal Households of England, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the United Kingdom. The office holder was responsible for running <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House, which houses <b>the</b> Crown <b>Jewels.</b> This role has, at various points in history, been called Master or Treasurer of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House, Master or Keeper of <b>the</b> Crown <b>Jewels,</b> Master or Keeper of the Regalia, and Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House. In 1967, the role was combined with Resident Governor of the Tower of London.|$|R
5000|$|According to the 2005 Arashikage Showdown comic, the Arashikage clan {{was founded}} many centuries {{ago by the}} Emperor of Japan to protect <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> of Amaterasu. <b>The</b> <b>jewel</b> allows its owner to control their chi. The [...] "map" [...] to <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> is a kata, only members of the Arashikage ninja clan have access to it. Centuries later, the Arashikage clan went to the temple housing <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> and {{performed}} <b>the</b> kata in order to access it. Soga, of the rival Nichira clan stole <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> before <b>the</b> Arashikage could claim it. The Arashikage attacked Soga at his headquarters, inciting a clan war, killing Soga in the process. Storm Shadow, of the Arashikage clan, took <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> to a location on Mt. Fuji and hid it.|$|R

5|$|Helen brings <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> to an appraiser, who recognizes them {{as having}} {{recently}} been reported stolen. Donelly and Gates bring Helen into the station, where they inform her Hal is the Creeper and accuse her of harboring a murderer. Reluctantly, she agrees {{to help them}} capture him. The next day, the newspapers run stories about Helen cooperating with police, which infuriates Hal. Feeling betrayed, he sneaks back into her apartment and finds her playing the piano. Sneaking up from behind, Hal is about to strangle her when the police seize and arrest him. The film ends with Donelly and Gates assuring Helen she will get the operation she needs.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
5|$|Kubera is the {{treasurer}} of the gods and overlord of the semi-divine Yakshas, the Guhyakas, Kinnaras and Gandharvas, who act as his assistants and protectors of <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> of the earth, as well as guardians of his city. Kubera is also the guardian of travelers and the giver of wealth to individuals, who please him. The Rakshasas also serve Kubera, however, some cannibalistic Rakshasas are described to have sided with Ravana {{in the battle against}} Kubera. Kubera also developed as minor marriage-divinity. He is invoked with Shiva at weddings and is described as Kameshvara ("Lord of Kama – pleasure, desire etc."). He is associated with fertility of the aquatic type.|$|E
5000|$|For {{most of the}} episodes, {{the primary}} storyline tells of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Riders' efforts to locate and secure each of <b>the</b> Crown <b>Jewels</b> before Lady Kale can get her hands on them or to win them back if she does. <b>The</b> seven Crown <b>Jewels</b> consist of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> of <b>the</b> North Woods (in [...] "Travel Trees Can't Dance"), <b>the</b> Rainbow <b>Jewel</b> found inside <b>the</b> Rainbow Falls (in [...] "Song of <b>the</b> Rainbow"), <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> of <b>the</b> Burning Ice found in the Hall of Wizards at the Wizard's Peak in the snow-covered {{mountains}} (in [...] "Wizard's Peak"), <b>the</b> Misty Rose <b>Jewel</b> found in <b>the</b> Misty Moors (in [...] "For Whom the Bell Trolls"), <b>the</b> Desert Star <b>Jewel</b> of <b>the</b> Great Desert found in the magical realm of Faeryland (in [...] "The Faery Princess"), <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> of <b>the</b> Dreamfields (in [...] "Dreamfields"), and <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> of <b>the</b> Jungle found in the hidden lair of the legendary wizard Morgana (in [...] "Revenge of the Dark Stone").|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theory for making rapid prototypes of jewelry from octree subdivision. Traditionally, {{the input of}} jewelry for making jewel rapid prototypes is the CAD models' representation. In this paper, a new representation for jewelry is introduced. Aesthetic jewelry is first bounded by a minimum bounding cube. The bounding cube is then subdivided into octrees. The cubes obtained are in three types: cubes fully filled <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> model; cubes partially filled <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> model and cubes out of <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> model. Cubes out of <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> model; are expelled, while cubes fully filled <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> model are retained. For cubes partially filled in <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> model, additional octree subdivision is performed. The number of octree subdivision levels depends upon the end-user requirement. After the octree subdivision process is completed, cubes partially filled <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> model from different subdivision levels are replaced by boundary voxels. The final voxel model undergoes direct slicing to build the rapid prototype. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|Originally, in Tolkien's {{writings}} {{from the}} 1910s and 1920s, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë (their final names) were {{the eldest of}} the Elves. By 1959 or 1960, Tolkien wrote {{a detailed account of}} the awakening of the Elves, called Cuivienyarna, part of Quendi and Eldar. Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë now became the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves. This text only saw print in The War of <b>the</b> <b>Jewels,</b> part of the analytical The History of Middle-earth series, in 1994, but a similar version was included in The Silmarillion in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The Street House Anglo-Saxon {{cemetery}} is an Anglo-Saxon burial ground, {{dating to}} {{the second half of}} the 7th century AD, that was discovered at Street House Farm near Loftus, in the unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland, England. Monuments dating back as far as 3300BC are located in the vicinity of the cemetery, which was discovered after aerial photography revealed the existence of an Iron Age rectangular enclosure. The excavations, carried out between 2005 and 2007, revealed over a hundred graves dating from the 7th century AD and the remains of several buildings. An array of jewellery and other artefacts was found, including <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> once worn by a young high-status Anglo-Saxon woman who had been buried on a bed and covered by an earth mound.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to coronations, the Imperial State Crown is usually worn at State Openings of Parliament, where the Sword of State and two maces are carried in procession. Fonts are used at royal christenings, and altar plate {{is used for}} weddings, Royal Maundy, {{and a few other}} occasions. Many pieces have fallen out of use altogether, like the trumpets and banqueting plate, and some were only designed to be used once. When not in use <b>the</b> <b>Jewels</b> are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House, a vault at the Tower of London where they are seen by around 2.5million visitors from across the world every year. Although {{they are part of the}} Royal Collection and owned by the king or queen for the duration of his or her reign, the Crown Jewels do not belong to the monarch personally.|$|E
5|$|Szczerbiec, {{together}} with other crown jewels, {{was removed from the}} Wawel Hill on several occasions during that period. After his Polish coronation in 1370, King Louis I of Hungary took the crown jewels with him to Buda; his successor on the Hungarian throne, Emperor Sigismund, rendered them to Poland in 1412. On two occasions, in mid-17th and early 18th centuries, they were evacuated across Poland's southern border to protect them from invading Swedish armies. In 1733, during the War of the Polish Succession, supporters of King Stanislaus I concealed <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> in a Warsaw church for three years to prevent Augustus III from using them in his coronation. In 1764, they were sent to Warsaw again, to be used in a coronation for the last time – that of Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski. They were returned to Kraków afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E
50|$|Famously, in 1722 {{a chimney}} sweep's boy sued de Lamerie after {{he found a}} jewel {{and took it to}} de Lamerie's shop to have it valued. When the boy asked for <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> back, de Lamerie's {{apprentice}} only returned the socket of <b>the</b> <b>jewel</b> and not <b>the</b> stones. The King's Bench held that even though the boy did not have absolute ownership of <b>the</b> <b>jewel,</b> <b>the</b> boy had the right to keep it against all but the rightful owner.

5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{the wake}} of the {{newspaper}} stories regarding the murder, the Viscount was reminded of the theft and demanded a search for <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> in Marie's room in Le Glandier. When <b>the</b> <b>jewels</b> turned up during the search, some newspapers believed her and put all the blame on the Viscountess. However, when she was put on trial for theft, the court was not so persuaded. Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle.|$|E
50|$|From 1660, as the Privy Wardrobe was {{no longer}} at the Tower of London, a {{caretaker}} was appointed as watchman for the Master of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House. He later {{became known as the}} Keeper of the Regalia or Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Office at <b>the</b> Tower. From this appointment, a separate branch of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House Department developed. When the latter was closed down, the Tower of London Jewel House alone remained.
