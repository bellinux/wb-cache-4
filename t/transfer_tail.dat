The response variable Y is subject to random censoring, but {{it is assumed that}} there exists a region of the covariate X where the censoring of Y is 2 ̆ 2 light. 2 ̆ 2 Under this condition, it is shown that the assumed nonparametric regression model can be used to <b>transfer</b> <b>tail</b> information from regions of light censoring to regions of heavy censoring. Crucial for this transfer is the estimator of the distribution of ε based on nonparametric regression residuals, whose weak convergence is obtained. The idea of transferrring tail information is applied to the estimation of the conditional distribution of Y given X = x with information on the upper tail 2 ̆ 2 borrowed 2 ̆ 2 from the region of light censoring, and to the estimation of the bivariate distribution P(X ≤ x, Y ≤ y) with no regions of undefined mass. The weak convergence of the two estimators is obtained. By-products of this investigation include the uniform consistency of the conditional Kaplan–Meier estimator and its derivative, the location and scale estimators and the estimators of their derivatives...|$|E

40|$|Apoptosis is {{fundamental}} to normal vertebrate development. A dramatic example of postembryonic development involving apoptosis is tail regression during amphibian metamorphosis. Earlier studies led us to propose a functional role for the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in tadpole tail regression. However, its physiological relevance has never been analyzed. We have now cloned a cDNA encoding Xenopus laevis bax (xlbax) and used in vivo gene <b>transfer</b> in <b>tail</b> muscle to analyze the effects of xlbax overexpression. Furthermore, by using an antisense strategy in a similar experimental paradigm, xlbax antisense mRNA was shown to block the apoptotic effects of xlbax and protect against apoptosis in metamorphosing tadpoles.

40|$|Optimal risk {{transfers}} {{are derived}} within an insurance group {{consisting of two}} separate legal entities, operating under potentially different regulatory capital requirements and capital costs. Consistent with regulatory practice, capital requirements for each entity are computed by either a value-at-risk or an expected shortfall risk measure. The optimality criterion consists of minimising the risk-adjusted value of the total group liabilities, with valuation carried out using a cost-of-capital approach. The optimisation problems are analytically solved and it is seen that optimal risk transfers often involve the <b>transfer</b> of <b>tail</b> risk (unlimited reinsurance layers) to the more weakly regulated entity. We show that, {{in the absence of}} a capital requirement for the credit risk that specifically arises from the risk transfer, optimal risk transfers achieve capital efficiency at the cost of increasing policyholder deficit. However, when credit risk is properly reflected in the capital requirement, incentives for tail-risk transfers vanish and policyholder welfare is restored...|$|R

To address this question, Apc(Min/+) and Apc(Min/+) Rag 2 (-/-) mice, which have a predilection to mammary carcinoma (as well as wild-type (wt) mice), received mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with mutant p 53 (p 53 MSC) <b>transferred</b> via <b>tail</b> vein injection.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha-dependent factors elaborated from mesenchymal cells converted quiescent epithelia into clinically apparent disease. The increased cancer phenotype was completely preventable with neutralization of TNF-alpha or by transfer of CD 4 (+) regulatory T cells from immune competent donors, demonstrating that immune competency to regulate inflammation was sufficient to maintain neoplastic dormancy even in the presence of oncogenic epithelial and stromal mutations.

30|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the onset of}} collisionless magnetic reconnection in {{the tail of the}} Earth’s magnetosphere. The two-and-a-half-dimensional version of a fully electromagnetic particle-in-cell code is used to describe the pre- and post-onset dynamics of reconnection in thin current sheets in the magnetotail. The ion/electron mass ratio is set to 100. The simulation starts out from an apparently stable equilibrium configuration. Applying an external electric field, meant to be caused by magnetic flux <b>transfer</b> to the <b>tail,</b> leads to the formation of a thin current sheet {{in the center of the}} plasma sheet. This confirms earlier results obtains with fluid and hybrid-methods. In the thin sheet quasi-static force-balance leads to a substantial decrease of the north-south component of the magnetic field in the center of the sheet. This in turn causes the electrons to become significantly nongyrotropic, such that a tearing mode starts growing. Regarding the nonideal process that supports the electric field in the diffusion region, the simulation results are shown to be consistent with the notion that electron pressure anisotropies associated with the nongyrotropy generate the required diffusive electric fields. The destabilizing role of electron nongyrotropy is confirmed by a simplified analysis of the energy principle for two-dimensional collisionless plasmas.|$|R

40|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{advantage of}} pulse combustors {{is a high}} rate of heat <b>transfer</b> in the <b>tail</b> pipe. Past research on these rates of heat transfer is inconclusive regarding the amount of heat transfer enhancement and how various flow parameters affect this enhancement. This article reports an experimental heat transfer study in the tail pipe of a pulse combustor. The pulsation frequency, pulsation amplitude, and mean flow rate were varied systematically, and their effects on the heat transfer rates assessed. Spatially averaged Nusselt numbers were obtained from thermocouple measurements using a standard log-mean heat exchanger calculation. The Nusselt number was found to increase with both pulsation amplitude and frequency, with a maximum enhancement of 2. 5 times that of steady flow at the same mean Reynolds number. The Nusselt number enhancement decreased with increasing mass flow rate for a given combustor pulsation frequency and amplitude. Independent axially resolved heat flux and gas temperature measurements confirmed the large Nusselt number increase with pulsations and demonstrated that entrance effects, although present, were small compared to the Nusselt number enhancement due to the pulsations. The data are compared with quasi-steady theory, which is the only available theory in the literature for this problem. Quasi-steady theory does not account for frequency effects and is not adequate for describing the data from this study...|$|R

BackgroundGlomerular macrophage accumulation is {{a feature of}} proliferative human and experimental glomerulonephritis. However, {{our understanding of the}} role of macrophages in the induction of renal injury is based upon indirect evidence from depletion studies, most of which lack specificity for this cell type. Therefore, an adoptive transfer approach was used to directly assess the potential of macrophages to induce renal injury. MethodsAccelerated anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease was induced in rats by immunization with sheep IgG (day - 5), followed by administration of sheep anti-rat GBM serum (day 0), with animals killed on day 2. To facilitate the adoptive transfer studies, immunized animals were made leukopenic by cyclophosphamide (CyPh) given on day - 2. Bone marrow-derived (BM) or NR 8383 macrophages were <b>transferred</b> by <b>tail</b> vein injection 24 hours after injection of anti-GBM serum, with animals killed 3 or 24 hours after transfer. ResultsPretreatment with CyPh prevented glomerular leukocyte accumulation and completely inhibited proteinuria, glomerular cell proliferation and hypercellularity in accelerated anti-GBM disease. Adoptive transfer led to significant glomerular accumulation of BM or NR 8383 macrophages within 3 hours of injection, and this was still evident 24 hours later. Adoptive transfer of BM or NR 8383 macrophages induced proteinuria (63 ± 16 BM vs. 5 ± 2 mg/ 24 h CyPh control; P < 0. 001), glomerular cell proliferation (5. 1 ± 1. 2 BM vs. 0. 5 ± 0. 1 PCNA+ cells/gcs CyPh; P < 0. 001) and glomerular hypercellularity (51. 2 ± 2. 0 BM vs. 41. 9 ± 0. 9 nuclei/gcs CyPh; P < 0. 001). The degree of renal injury correlated with the number of transferred glomerular macrophages. Two-color immunostaining demonstrated that most glomerular proliferative cell nuclear antigen+ (PCNA+) proliferating cells were OX- 7 + mesangial cells. CyPh treatment did not prevent up-regulation of glomerular intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM- 1) expression or an increase in urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) excretion.

Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans outer membrane protein 29 (Omp 29) and A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were injected into 3 palatal gingival sites, and Omp 29 -specific T clone cells were <b>transferred</b> into the <b>tail</b> veins of rats. Rabbit anti-RANKL IgG antibody or F(ab) 2 antibody fragments thereof were injected into the palatal sites in each rat (days 1, 1, and 3). Anti-RANKL IgG antibody significantly inhibited soluble RANKL (sRANKL) -induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro, in a dose-dependent manner, but also gave rise to a rat antibody response to rabbit IgG in vivo, with no significant inhibition of periodontal bone resorption detected. Lower doses (1. 5 and 0. 15 g/ 3 sites) of F(ab) 2 antibody were not immunogenic in the context of the experimental model. Periodontal bone resorption was inhibited significantly by injection of the anti-RANKL F(ab) 2 antibody into gingivae. The sRANKL concentrations for the antibody-treated groups were decreased significantly compared to those for the untreated group. Osteoclasts on the alveolar bone surface were also diminished significantly after antibody injection. Gingival sRANKL concentration and bone loss showed a significant correlation with one another in animals receiving anti-RANKL F(ab) 2 antibody.

In {{the present study}} {{with the aim of}} decreasing analgesic dose of morphine, analgesic effect of different doses of SO hydroalcoholic extract alone and associated with morphine were evaluated by tail flick in rats. Subjects and Methods: Analgesic effects of SO hydroalcholic extract at doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i. p. were investigated. Then the influence of these doses associated with analgesic dose of morphine (2. 5 mg/kg) was evaluated. Rats were placed into restrainer and then <b>transferred</b> into the <b>tail</b> flick apparatus with the intensity 55 Cº and cut off time= 10 sec. In order to verify the role of opioid receptors on analgesic effect of SO extract, naloxone (1 mg/kg, i. p.) was administered to one group of rats 15 min before receiving 800 mg/kg extract. Then, the data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc test and significant difference between groups was accepted with P< 0. 05. Results: The Data have shown that, the SO extract relieved pain in tail-flick test dose dependently and the most effective dose was 800 mg/kg. The maximum analgesic effect of the extract combined with morphine was observed at time point 45 min. Naloxane, opioid receptor antagonist could reduce analgesic effect of the extract. Conclusion: On the basis the results obtained in this study, it could be suggested that the SO extract potentiates morphine anti-nociceptive effect and this means that the opioid system may be involved in the analgesic effect of this plant extract.

Prior to this successful attack, screening of checked baggage was limited in both scale and technical ability. Screening tended to be focused almost exclusively on flights categorised as high risk or with a temporary elevated threat due to the carriage of certain high profile passengers.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{survive and}} reproduce, animals {{must be able}} to modify their motor {{behavior}} in response to changes in the environment. We studied a complex behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans, male mating behavior, which provided a model for understanding motor behaviors at the genetic, molecular as well as circuit level. C. elegans male mating behavior consists of a series of six sub-steps: response to contact, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule insertion, and sperm <b>transfer.</b> The male <b>tail</b> contains most of the sensory structures required for mating, in addition to the copulatory structures, and thus to carry out the steps of mating behavior, the male must keep his tail in contact with the hermaphrodite. However, because the hermaphrodite does not play an active role in mating and continues moving, the male must modify his tail posture to maintain contact. We provide {{a better understanding of the}} molecular and neuro-muscular pathways that regulate male tail posture during mating. Results Genetic and laser ablation analysis, in conjunction with behavioral assays were used to determine neurotransmitters, receptors, neurons and muscles required for the regulation of male tail posture. We showed that proper male tail posture is maintained by the coordinated activity of opposing muscle groups that curl the tail ventrally and dorsally. Specifically, acetylcholine regulates both ventral and dorsal curling of the male tail, partially through anthelmintic levamisole-sensitive, nicotinic receptor subunits. Male-specific muscles are required for acetylcholine-driven ventral curling of the male tail but dorsal curling requires the dorsal body wall muscles shared by males and hermaphrodites. Gamma-aminobutyric acid activity is required for both dorsal and ventral acetylcholine-induced curling of the male tail and an inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, UNC- 49, prevents over-curling of the male tail during mating, suggesting that cross-inhibition of muscle groups helps maintain proper tail posture. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that coordination of opposing sex-specific and core muscle groups, through the activity of multiple neurotransmitters, is required for regulation of male tail posture during mating. We have provided a simple model for regulation of male tail posture that provides a foundation for studies of how genes, molecular pathways, and neural circuits contribute to sensory regulation of this motor behavior. </p...|$|R
40|$|TOF neutron {{diffraction}} and multinuclear MAS NMR data are combined {{to investigate the}} local structure of three silicate based glass forming systems. The effects of experimental resolution on the structural parameters obtained from {{neutron diffraction}} data are considered using simulated correlation functions. The Gaussian fit parameters to a peak in T(r) report a smaller peak width and area {{than that of the}} Gaussian broadening. This is due to the contribution of the real- space resolution function. This effect is most dramatic for small values of _t_h_e_r_m_a_l" 1 "/" 2 and Q_m_a_x but is negligible for typical values. The experimental uncertainty in measuring Q is considered for TOF neutron diffraction data. #DELTA#Q is considered constant for data measured at several scattering angles. Some of the scattering intensity is <b>transferred</b> to a <b>tail</b> on the low r side of each peak, the magnitude of which increases with #DELTA#Q. The peak fit parameters (position, width and area) change with increasing #DELTA#Q, both before and after removing the gradient at low r. The Q-space resolution at a fixed scattering angle is considered by broadening i(Q) with a Gaussian of width #DELTA#Q/Q=constant. The peak fit parameters change with increasing #DELTA#Q/Q but not significantly at the resolution quoted for the high angle detectors on LAD. The interpretation of experimental data in terms of glass structure is greatly dependant upon an accurate knowledge of the glass composition. It is considered necessary to determine the concentration of all the cation species by a single or combination of techniques. TOF neutron diffraction and " 1 " 7 O MAS NMR data are reported for several (SnO) _x(SiO_ 2) _ 1 _-_x glasses and a partially crystallised (SnO) (SiO_ 2) sample.

The (SnO) _x(SiO_ 2) _ 1 _-_x glasses are thought to consist of a network of SnO_ 3 _/_ 3 and SiO_ 4 _/_ 2 polyhedra. The tin polyhedra may form pairs or chains. The local order in the crystalline phase is thought to be similar to that in the glasses. There are two tin and two silicon sites in the crystal phase of approximate composition (SnO) _ 4 (SiO_ 2). It has not been possible to refine the crystal structure.

The tin is present as Sn" 2 "+ and is three co-ordinated at all compositions. Replacing the tin with modifier oxide reduces the " 2 " 9 Si NMR chemical shift. The modifier cation is thought to depolymerise the tin silicate network, associating with the tin to maintain charge neutrality. " 2 " 9 Si and " 3 " 1 P MAS NMR and TOF neutron diffraction data are presented for (K_ 2 O- 4 SiO_ 2) _x(P_ 2 O_ 5) _ 1 _-_x, (K_ 2 O- 2 SiO_ 2) _x(P_ 2 O_ 5) _ 1 _-_x and (SiO_ 2) _x(P_ 2 O_ 5) _ 1 _-_x glasses. Each glass contains Si"I"V and Si"V"I species, the potassium tetrasilicate-P_ 2 O_ 5 glasses also contain Si"V species. The proportion of silicon species changed with thermal history. Each glass is thought to consist of a modified phosphosilicate network. The potassium disilicate-P_ 2 O_ 5 glasses are thought to consist of a continuous network of Si(OP) _ 3 (OSi), Si(OP) _ 4 (OSi) _ 2, (P-Q" 2) "- and (P-Q" 4) "+ species. The alkali-free phosphosilicate and potassium tetrasilicate-P_ 2 O_ 5 glasses are thought to have similar structures but {{it is not possible to}} define the phosphate species. It was not possible to distinguish the different species by neutron diffraction. The phosphosilicate network is thought to be more disordered than modified phosphate and modified silicate networks.

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty-five years, {{there have been}} an {{increasingly}} large number of extreme events in the financial markets. This includes market crashes and natural disasters {{that have led to}} extremely large losses and claims. Extreme event risk affects all aspects of risk assessment modeling and management. Traditional risk measurement methods focus on probability of laws governing average of sums, and do not focus on the tails of distribution. The investigation concerns the characterization and development of extreme markets scenarios for use in risk measurement and capital adequacy determination frameworks. The first part of the investigation concerns the development of event timelines {{that can be used for}} characterizing whether a period of time should be considered normal or extreme market conditions or regimes. The time lines have allowed the identification of the different times when the markets were calm and when the markets were turbulent. They assist in building scenarios, and also to identify the scenarios for decomposition of data to model the different regions, either the tail or the center of the distribution using the mentioned regime switching models. The information from the event time line can be used to define scenarios in a stress testing context. In this investigation, extreme value analysis, which is an extension of the standard VaR techniques, useful in measuring extreme events has been used, which fits density functions by placing more weights in the tails than the normal Gaussian distribution and model the upper and lower tail of an underlying distribution. Extreme value distribution functions including "fat tailed" will be fitted to the tails of critical market factors to model the extreme market events that are not given appropriate probability of occurrence under normal conditions. The Hill estimator, which is recognized as the consistent estimator for empirical analysis is used for calculating the tail index parameter for EVT modeling, However, it has to be noted that the Hill estimator is efficient when the underlying distribution is fat-tailed as compared to the gaussian, where the tail index estimates tend to go to infinity. The performance of Extreme value theory estimation technique with multiple regimes on real and simulated financial time series for efficient results, compared to the standard VaR techniques has been studied. In this investigation, multiple regime switching approach has been used to identify regimes and measure risk accordingly. It is assumed that the center of the returns distribution is normally distributed with 90 percent of the data in the in the center region and each tail contains 5 percent of the data. Three regime switching models have been used in this analysis which includes, the Unconditional LT-C-RT (Left tail - Center - Right <b>Tail)</b> <b>transfers,</b> the 3 State Regime Markov Transition Model and the Geometric Time in Trail Model. The regime switching models are modeled using the following procedures: 1) The Unconditional LT-C-RT (Left Tail - Center - Right Tail) model is an IID model (Independent and Identically Distributed) model and has a simple Bernoulli approach where the market is in a normal state with probability P or an abnormal state with probability 1 - p. The transition between states is independent of the last state. 2) A Markov chain approach where the next state of the market is a function of the current state. That there are the following transitions possible: 2. 1) Normal to normal 2. 2) Normal to abnormal 2. 3) Abnormal to abnormal 2. 4) Abnormal to normal 3). The Geometric Time in Tail model is a hybrid Bernoulli approach where the markets stays in a given state based on a duration model and when the duration in a given states has expired, the sampling of the next state using a independent Bernoulli approach similar to approach one. This implies that the after the market has stayed in a given regime for the sample duration time, it can stay in the current regime with probability p or leave the regime with probability 1 - p. The sample duration can be based on the exponential distribution for continuous time and the geometric distribution for discrete time such as daily movements. Tail index estimation results using EVT indicate the presence of fat tails in equity data and the results of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) are considerably similar for the three regime switching models. The comparison of results from the multiple regime switching models to the one region distribution results, which serve as the base case prove the efficiency of using this approach for a better risk measure...|$|R
