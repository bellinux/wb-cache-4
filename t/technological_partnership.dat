40|$|Research on <b>technological</b> <b>partnerships</b> has {{traditionally}} sought explanation {{of their high}} failure rates in partner characteristics and relationship features. This study introduces {{the notion of a}} 'bumpy road' in technology partnerships which refers to undesired outcomes such as 'partnership mal-functioning' and 'instability' to the degree to which innovation activities are hampered. We explain how firm-level strategies can reduce the probability of a 'bumpy road' in partnerships. We also assess the impact of this 'bumpy road' on innovative performance. We find that firms that excel in diversification of external activities (in terms of different types of partners) perform best. Moreover, a persistent product oriented innovation strategy geared at developing new products, new markets, or higher product quality will yield more stable partnership outcomes. Our results confirm that engagement in partnerships is beneficial for innovative performance. However, firms that experienced a 'bumpy road' in their <b>technological</b> <b>partnerships</b> have to pay a price in terms of a negative effect on their innovative performance.

Later, with the establishment of <b>technological</b> <b>partnerships</b> and development of an internal R&D structure, creative imitations began to be undertaken by these companies. Currently, the multinational companies studied pursue excellence in internal R&D and a strengthening of interactions with external sources of knowledge and technology as an alternative to accelerating organizational learning for innovation...|$|R

To be able to understand how firms overcome these systemic constraints and bring about positive externalities it would be important to observe the strategic role played by firms. Firms are removing technological and economic constraints by engaging in strategic alliances with other firms and research organizations.

50|$|Even {{before the}} {{construction}} of the T-33, it was decided to increase the scale of work dedicated to creating an amphibious tank. In addition to the Leningrad OKMO, the Number 2 plant of the All-Soviet Automotive Union (VATO), which was already producing armored vehicles for the Red Army, was relegated to the development and production of amphibious armored vehicles. As a result, at the 2nd VATO plant, under the supervision of N. N. Kozyrev, the T-41 amphibious tank was produced, weighing 3.5 tons and using the GAZ-AA engine, which was based on the T-27 power plant. The transmission was nearly identical to that of the T-27, and to the power take-off for the propeller, they added a rigid gear clutch. Its construction for turning off the propeller demanded stopping the tank and turning off the engine. The chassis was, in part, borrowed from the T-33, and the caterpillar tracks were entirely from the T-27. Leningrad builders likewise continued the development of a more suitable amphibious tank, and they designated their latest model as the “T-37”. It had the same GAZ AA engine as the T-41, the same transmission, wide use of automotive parts, and the Krupp chassis, which Soviet engineers first encountered {{as a result of a}} <b>technological</b> <b>partnership</b> with Weimar Germany. Although the T-41 was actually produced for the military in small numbers, after testing and battlefield trials the T-37 was denied production due to various minor faults and an incomplete development process.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the firms’ motives for {{entering}} into knowledge partnerships. We start by showing that networking strategies are designed to access external knowledge whilst maintaining {{at the same time}} a sufficient level of knowledge appropriation and tradability. The ICT sector (and interplaying ones) is particularly concerned by this accessibility/appropriation trade-off. The questions of modularity, complementarity, compatibility and standardisation are critical in the formation of corporate strategic and <b>technological</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Considering that knowledge in this sector is complex and systemic, we construct a theoretical typology of knowledge partnerships by crossing the levels of cognitive and relational proximity with the knowledge phases of exploration, examination and exploitation. This typology is then tested on empirical data through the use of a classification algorithm. The dataset is based on a sample of strategic alliances in the European ICT sector extracted from SDC Platinum. We show that strategic alliances are clustered in relation to the knowledge phases (exploration, examination, exploitation), and that the alliance categories are characterised by levels of relational and cognitive distance which actually are in keeping with the theoretical predictions. knowledge networks; knowledge phases; proximities; strategic alliances; ICT sector...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{technological}} management in a dairy industry, making it possible to suggest improvements. An open-ended questionnaire was applied, considering two main points: the classification and comprehension of the company’s performance in relation to the technologies available and the understanding of the industry’s technological motivations, making it possible to analyze technological behaviors, forms of acquisition and adoption of technological innovations. It was observed that the company loses competitiveness due to the technology adopted, when compared to bigger players and when the distribution of its products is carried out through supermarkets. The changes introduced in the products’ portfolio were of public-domain, stable and highly divulged, in other words, they were not a technological barrier to the industry’s competitors. The industry established a <b>technological</b> <b>partnership</b> with research institutes for treating the industrial effluents and also with another dairy industry, fortifying its financial, production and marketing areas. It was concluded that improvements in the production process, to reduce costs and better meet the consumers’ needs, are still necessary.

40|$|Purpose – Collaboration is an {{advantageous}} {{strategy for}} technology‐based competition. Thus, {{it is of}} high concern to understand mechanisms behind the success of collaborations such as performance measurement system. This paper will present an empirical study conducted in the Turkish textile industry where performance measures are developed and applied. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilizes a combination of interviews and surveys to collect data from 3 T partners that are six technology supplying and ten dyeing and finishing companies. The findings indicate that besides trust, {{the existence of a}} performance measurement system is an extremely important bridge for effective supply chain collaboration (SCC). Such a system should cover metrics related to internal performance, perceptions of partners regarding the alliance performance, and the degree of inter‐firm relationship. Findings – The paper is based on a technology partnership so the results need to be taken cautiously. However, it is clear that 3 T is a successful <b>technological</b> <b>partnership</b> with six new technologies developed in two‐year period. There are some potential improvement areas, particularly in its internal activities and its relationship with the partners. The study shows that as the level of information sharing and communication among the partners increase, the performance and the benefits of the collaboration also increase. Originality/value – SCC can have long‐term goals like continuous product innovation as experienced in 3 T and this might increase overall performance of an industry. That is why SCC might be particularly important tool for developing country firms that lack both financial and human resources...|$|E

Implementing green innovations represents a great challenge for non-green companies because it often requires the acquisition of new resources and competences that differ significantly from their existing competences.
