40|$|A {{professional}} project report submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resources Program, the University of New Mexico. <b>The</b> Sandia Canyon <b>Wetland</b> is an effluent supported wetland sustained by three National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted outfalls. <b>The</b> <b>wetland</b> sediments contain an inventory of chromium released from historic operations. Maintaining physical and geochemical stability in <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> is intended to keep the chromium inventory in its reduced trivalent state to minimize mobility and subsequent offsite migration. Upgrades to the Sanitary Effluent Reclamation Facility (SERF) decreased {{the amount of water}} used in nearby cooling towers, and therefore reduced the volume of effluent discharged into <b>the</b> <b>wetland.</b> SERF provides tertiary treatment to treated sanitary effluent creating water of improved quality to allow for additional cycles of concentration in the cooling towers. In November 2013, a grade control structure was installed at the terminus of <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> to provide physical stability, to help maintain high groundwater levels in <b>the</b> <b>wetland,</b> and to maintain reducing conditions within <b>the</b> <b>wetland.</b> A network of alluvial piezometers and surface water gages, above and below <b>the</b> <b>wetland,</b> was used to monitor changes of hydrology and geochemistry within <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> that may have resulted from the decreased effluent volumes and installation of the grade control structure. Water samples were collected from the monitoring network between November 2012 and March 2014. Piezometer water levels showed stable groundwater elevations in <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> while <b>the</b> presence of ammonium and sulfide suggested reducing conditions were present even after the effluent volumes decreased. The manganese, iron, and chromium concentrations in groundwater and surface water samples further indicate that anaerobic conditions were present in <b>the</b> <b>wetland.</b> Over <b>the</b> monitoring period reported in this project, the results indicate <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> has sustained reducing conditions to maintain the chromium inventory in the reduced trivalent state...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{vegetation}} within constructed stormwater wetlands {{plays an important}} role in the treatment processes taking place, its density and distribution depends on <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> bathymetry and <b>the</b> imposed hydrologic regime. This paper describes an ecological and hydrological assessment of a constructed stormwater treatment wetland. A continuous simulation hydrologic model of the urban catchment and <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> system is employed. The study also includes a site monitoring program of vegetation and ecosystem characteristics within both <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> and <b>the</b> upstream and downstream sections of the urban stream system. The hydrological analysis of the system has been used to investigate the impact of the hydrologic regime on the ecosystem. The model is also used to investigate rainwater harvesting within the catchment and stormwater harvesting from <b>the</b> <b>wetland.</b> <b>The</b> study has shown that <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> provides significant interception of rainfall, which is linked to the improved ecosystem characteristics observed in the stream system downstream of <b>the</b> <b>wetland.</b> Rainwater and stormwater harvesting is shown to provide potable water savings of up to 39. 0 % of the annual average household potable water demand.

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain <b>the</b> <b>wetlands</b> and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{a tunnel}} was {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Connector, traveling underneath Horace J.

The same year, Mirage Resorts president Steve Wynn proposed a new casino resort in the marina district, and stated that resort would not be built unless there was better access to the site. Additional plans were later researched, and six different plans were proposed. The plans included the tunnel underneath Horace J. Bryant Drive, a tunnel underneath the adjacent Penrose Canal, two alternative tunnel locations, the elevated highway above <b>the</b> <b>wetlands,</b> and the improvement of existing streets to direct traffic through the city.

The findings reported in this paper were aimed at establishing the baseline water quality before the biomanipulation of <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> to demonstrate <b>the</b> impact of Kirinya West wetland in treating secondary municipal effluent from the existing waste stabilisation ponds. The bio-manipulation of <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> will entail spreading the effluent from the stabilisation ponds over the northern edges of <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> so as to increase the treatment area of <b>the</b> <b>wetland</b> and hence its treatment efficiency. The baseline data indicate that there is significant improvement of water quality as the wastewater flowed through the ponds (61 % decrease in NH 4 -N, 46. 9 % for o-PO 4 and 98 % for faecal coliforms).

5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through <b>the</b> <b>wetlands</b> of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes.

5|$|Riparian {{vegetation}} {{is mostly}} found along the lower {{two-thirds of the}} Kootenay {{and many of the}} tributaries that join within the United States. The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily where the river broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of <b>the</b> <b>wetlands</b> converted to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into <b>the</b> <b>wetlands</b> accelerate succession.
