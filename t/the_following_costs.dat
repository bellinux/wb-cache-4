The recently completed LIPID trial with pravastatin in secondary prevention immediately raise the question whether pravastatin might be cost-effective in Switzerland. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of third party payers. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>costs</b> were included in the analysis: daily treatment costs of pravastatin, non fatal myocardial infarction, coronary bypass operations and stroke. Life years gained was obtained by applying the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy. All calculations were standardized to 1000 treated patients. RESULTS: The net costs of treating 1000 patients (i. e. drug costs minus the costs of sequelae and interventions) are Fr. 3. 6 Mio. In addition, a total of 430 life-years may be saved through treatment. The corresponding cost-effectiveness of pravastatin treatment is Fr. 8341 (nominal) Fr. 6985 (discounted).

Hospital admissions, {{the largest single}} item of diabetes expenditure, are often precipitated by hyperglycaemic emergencies. A recent survey of a 200 - bed hospital, serving approximately 1. 3 million Cape Town residents, showed that hyperglycaemic emergencies comprised 25. 6 % of high-care unit admissions. A study was undertaken to determine the reasons for, and financial cost of, these admissions. Methods. All hyperglycaemic admissions during a 2 -month period (1 September - 31 October 2005) were surveyed prospectively. Admissions were classified using the American Diabetes Association classification of hyperglycaemic emergencies. Demographic data, and the reason for, duration of and primary outcome of admission, were recorded. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>costs</b> per admission were calculated using public sector pricing: (i) total costs; (ii) patient-specific costs; (iii) no patient- specific costs; and (iv) capital costs. Results. Sepsis (36 %), non-compliance with therapy (32 %) and a new diagnosis of diabetes (11 %) were the predominant reasons for admission of 53 hyperglycaemic emergency cases. Mean duration of hospital stay was 4 days, with an in-hospital mortality of 7. 5 %. Mean cost per admission was R 5 309.

Economic values are calculated for fertility, udder health and production traits when one genetic standard deviation unit (gen. sd.) is changed in each trait independently and the financial returns from selection response in the Finnish dairy cattle breeding programme are estimated. The following components were {{used to calculate the}} economic value of mastitis treatments: 1) cost of mastitis including discarded milk and treatment costs, 2) reduction in milk price due to higher somatic cell count, 3) replacement costs and 4) lower production level of the herd due to involuntary culling of cows because of udder problems.

40|$|In this lecture we {{analyze the}} splay tree {{algorithm}} {{presented in the}} last lecture. Splay tree algorithm is an elegant algorithm for maintaining a dictionary which stores its keys in a binary search tree. The algorithm attempts to keep the tree balanced and {{can be thought of}} as an analogue of the move-to-front algorithm from one of the previous lectures. The main intuition of the analysis is as follows: The “move-to-root ” action of the algorithm results in approximately a doubling of the work required to perform the search part of the operation required to perform the FIND, INSERT, or DELETE action. When the search is short, this doubling is does not add significantly to the overall amortized cost, but when the search is long, the resulting tree is better balanced than the tree we began with. We will define an appropriate potential function to measure the effect of each step on the tree balance. In order to define our potential function, we need some preliminary definitions: For each node X, we define s(X) as the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at X, and the rank, r(X) of the node X as lg (s(X)), where the lg stands for log to the base 2. The potential of the tree T is Φ(T) = � X r(X). It is easy to see that the potential function Φ of an n-node tree T is minimized by a perfectly balanced tree for which Φ(T) is approximately n, and maximized by a tree in which every right child is a leaf, for which Φ(T) ≈ n lg (n).

40|$|Large {{parts of}} the west of the Netherlands consist of peat meadows. In these areas, soil {{subsidence}} occurs, mainly {{as a result of the}} oxidation of the peat layer above the groundwater level. This subsidence is causing sagging of houses and infrastructure, greenhouse gas emissions and eutrophication of the surface water. Therefore, governments are currently looking for a sustainable approach to combat soil subsidence in the peat meadows. Water board De Stichtse Rijnlanden (HDSR) is responsible for setting the water levels in about 25. 000 hectares of peat meadows. Since the soil subsidence rate is depending on the groundwater levels, the water board is facing the choice whether to lower the water levels, following the soil subsidence, in order to maintain a freeboard that is suitable for agriculture (current practice) or stop this lowering of the water levels in order to slow down the subsidence of the soil. 	The first part of study aims at filling some of the knowledge gaps that are currently still obstructing an inclusive assessment of the different management options available. These are the lack of a comprehensive overview of the outcomes of previous studies on this subject and the lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between soil subsidence and the costs for road and sewer management. The second part of the study aims at indicating what scenarios for future management may contribute to a sustainable development of the peat meadows. 	For the first part, a literature study and interviews with municipal road and sewer managers were carried out. For the second part, four scenarios were compared, of which two assumed a continuation of the lowering of the water levels, and in the other two, water level lowering is ceased. Of both scenario sets, the first assumed no additional measures to mitigate the negative consequences of the scenario, and the second did include such measures. 	It turned out that, when contemplating soil subsidence and measures to mitigate soil subsidence, <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits are relevant to take into account: pumping costs, initial investment costs, agricultural yield, foundation damage, damage to roads, sewers, pipelines and cables, high water level facilities, sagging of dikes, inundation damage, water quality, property prices, recreational benefits, greenhouse gas emissions, landscape and cultural heritage, biodiversity/non-use value of nature and further emotional aspects. 	Furthermore, it became clear that municipal road and sewer managers indeed need to take additional measures as a result of soil subsidence. The costs per m 2 for road management in peat meadow areas are about 25 % to 35 % higher than in areas without soil subsidence. Concerning sewers, the major difference was that the depreciation periods of sewers in peat meadow areas were much shorter (40 years instead of 60 years for gravity drained sewers) and that there are additional costs for cleaning the sewers. 	The scenario study indicated that it is not possible to maintain the current use of peat meadows in a way that is physically sustainable. Agricultural use of the peat meadows will always entail some soil subsidence. Although the scenario study showed that the total costs of soil subsidence will likely be the lowest in scenarios where the lowering of the water levels is ceased and additional measures are taken to mitigate loss of agricultural yield, this will still have a negative impact on the agricultural yield. Therefore, the choice whether to put a strategy like this in practice will be mainly a political one...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is due to}} {{the need}} to focus, from a legal point of view, the {{institution}} of “urbanistic equalization”. Equalizing modalities take place, within some Municipalities, in order to overcome the intrinsic discrimination, typical of planning processes. To enforce this kind of technique, as a matter of fact, means to overtake, respect to the owners, an undifferentiated condition with regard to the characterizing effects deriving from discretional choices of territorial functional zoning. The thesis, then, examines the matter of urbanistic equalization, starting from a complete investigation of the sources and origins, with the intent to specify institutions and remarkable legal problems, with regard to a new relationship between public administration and private ownership. The Law n. 1150 / 1942 (Art. 7), provides that town planning is based on a master-plan. This implies a land-zoning in which each “zone” is characterized by a specific function. The result is the creation of inequalities between the owners of properties benefited by building rights and those owners whose properties are subjected to expropriation. This happens because all the involved owners are equally subjected to support the duties connected to the construction of public works and services but it’s unavoidable that these works grant privileges to subjective situations. Several attempts to change the town-planning laws were undertaken, in the past, but they all failed. For instance the so-called “Progetto Sullo”, the Law n. 765 (year 1997) or the Law n. 10 (year 1977). Step by step, a different outlook grew up; thanks to the Constitution principles and to an ever more pointed out demand (even from the E. U.), the need to remark the ethical value of equity has been noticed. This requirement, within the urbanistic laws, is pursued to protect the citizens’ private property from the power granted to the public authorities. In comparison with the Legislative gap, the first effords to overtake a change developed straight on the territory, in those Municipalities where concrete attempts of equalization techniques’ application are pursued. Regional provisions occurred, later, but they have to do with rules which don’t work out a specific regulation; they mostly are just principles statements. As a consequence, into practice, different patterns have been carried out, connected {{to the needs of the}} land where they have been applied. Some general indications came out in the variegated outline. It’s necessary to make some principles clear. The “equalization” may be: -“of values”, if obtained through strictly financial operations, like fiscal reductions to indemnify the owner for the lost building suitability on his property; -“of volumes”, if building suitability, which may be accomplished only on a different land respect the one where it was originally settled, is assigned (within predetermined areas); -“a priori”, if building rights are not negotiable, since they are recognized to the land as an implicit potential, apart from the planner’s choices, but concerning the condition “in fact and in law” in which the area is standing. - “a posteriori”, if all the foreseen building rights are distributed between the lands involved by the plans - independently of the future lands’ function - so that their negotiation with the public authority is allowed; -“generalized or partial”, according to its being extended either to all the conversion areas or to some circumscribed areas. In both cases, the mechanism provides for the public authority to allot to each area the same building suitability, after having classified the lands according to the “in fact and in law” conditions; later, the public authority establishes the “landing areas” (where building activity will really be possible) and the “take-off areas” (where public services and works will rise). In case some subjects wanted to build, they’ll have to buy the “volume” from the take-off areas’ owners. -“by compartment”, based on the determination of specific zones in which the same building suitability is recognized to the owners, apart from the future function of the single areas; the subjects will be able to deal the building rights but just between areas localized in the same compartment. -“by expanded compartment”, if the building rights can be dealed even between owners of lands localized out of the compartment; -“compensative”, if private owners transfer certain areas to the public authority, directly realizing works of public interest. Troubles came out whereas some Municipalities tried to use the term “equalization” to mask expropriation processes without compensation. Nevertheless, the Administrative Jurisprudence intervened. The main difficulty remains connected to the purpose that the foreseen mechanisms are realized. The risk is to leave the so-called “public town” un-realized, with <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>costs</b> for the whole community. Just recently (Law 244 / 2007 - art. 1 comma 258 / 259, Law 133 / 2008 and, even more significant, the s. c. “Development Decree” n. 70 of 2011) the urbanistic equalization is expressly mentioned. Nevertheless, also in these cases, the legislator lost the opportunity to make this matter clear. The reasons which justify the application of equalization mechanisms are: - equality between the subjects interested in the planning; - a different idea of public administration, devoted to a greater involvement of private owners, even in the land matters; - the shortage of financial resources for the municipalities; - the need to justify and indemnify the expropriation bounds. Authoritative acts are always possibile but they have to be considered as extreme drastic measures. Having made these preliminary statements clear, we faced the main theme concerning the legal institutes which the different equalization mechanisms can be referred to. To carry this out, we need to consider that “equalization” implies a split between theoretical building rights and jus aedificandi. This way, it’s believed that a specific deal is generated, where the authority is called to establish the rules and watch over the correct course, through holding proper auctions. The Decree n. 70 of 2011 provides that are subjected to registration (according to civil code art. 2642) even the contracts which transfer, settle or modify the building rights however denominated. The importance of this rule is represented by the protection of the “assurance” requirement within the rights circulation but not clearing up their nature. The formulation, then, should identify the equalization mechanism as an agreement between the public administration and the private owners, provided by the Law n. 241 of 1990, art. 11. If the subjects, whatever pattern of equalization is chosen, perceive the adherence as “economically convenient”, even the doubts connected to the possible violation of the s. c. “minimum content of the stated right of ownership” (Constitution, Art. 42) would be overcome. The equalization presents criticality which, still, can be limited by the pre-eminent role that the public administration must have, within the management of the building rights. Everything, anyway, starts from the concept of “urbanistic equalization” as a public-private agreement. With the present work, we tried to point out the problems connected to the urbanistic equalization choices as well as the attempts that have been made to resolve them. ...|$|E
