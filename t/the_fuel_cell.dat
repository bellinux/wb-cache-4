Fluoroelastomers such as Viton are crosslinked fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in O-rings; perfluorobutane (C4F10) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.|$|E

The Final Report contains limited data because <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> were started up November 2005 and shutdown March 2006. The price of natural gas, which is <b>the</b> primary <b>fuel</b> for <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> escalated by 200 % following hurricane Katrina in August 2005.
