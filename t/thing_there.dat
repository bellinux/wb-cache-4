5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific <b>thing.</b> <b>There</b> was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E

25|$|Chiume later drew {{attention}} to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating {{their opposition to the}} post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them. Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots {{had been going on for}} some time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response. The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest <b>thing</b> <b>there</b> was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.|$|E
25|$|Kürd Mehmed {{took for}} himself Abaza Hasan's former post as voyvoda of the Yeni Il Türkmen, and {{subsequently}} sought to undermine Ibşir Pasha's other former supporters. One {{of these was}} Seydi Ahmed Pasha, who had recently been appointed governor of Karaman. While Seydi {{was on his way}} to the provincial capital, Konya, Kürd Mehmed entered the city and convinced the population to resist the incoming governor, warning of his tyranny. Thus when Seydi arrived, he found the city armed against him with Kürd Mehmed organizing its defense. This led to an alliance between Seydi Ahmed and Abaza Hasan, as the two of them besieged Konya together, driving Kürd Mehmed out of the city. Yet by this time, orders had arrived from Istanbul removing Seydi from his post and assigning him to Aleppo instead. When Seydi and Abaza Hasan arrived, they found that Kürd Mehmed had done the same <b>thing</b> <b>there</b> as well, rallying the population of Aleppo to defend the city against them. Ultimately, Aleppo fell into Seydi's hands and Kürd Mehmed fled to Adana, where he and his men were killed.|$|E
25|$|If two {{individuals}} desire the same <b>thing,</b> <b>there</b> {{will soon be}} a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At {{this stage of the}} crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually {{over the course of the}} repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.|$|E

He invites Hazel to his house where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite book. Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends {{in the middle of a}} sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the growing}} tension, Haynes {{remained}} a member and Betts returned. Their third post-reunion record, Where It All Begins (1994), was recorded entirely live. [...] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year <b>thing.</b> <b>There</b> {{was no indication}} that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, {{and there was no}} reason to think otherwise," [...] said Haynes. The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup. [...] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I’m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" [...] said Trucks. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E

Something goes wrong, {{and he is}} transformed into the monster known as the Lizard. Ifans said his character spends {{the majority of the}} film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt-double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, [...] "I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Each and every time you see the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're my emotions. That's how spectacularly advanced technology is." [...] Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, [...] "I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, but when I was shooting the CGI moments, when I wasn't actually human, when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard <b>thing.</b> <b>There</b> were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard." ...|$|E
500|$|As noted earlier, {{even among}} writers who {{consider}} consciousness to be a well-defined <b>thing,</b> <b>there</b> is widespread dispute about which animals other than humans {{can be said}} to possess it. Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties. [...] Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of [...] evolutionary biology as an adaptation {{in the sense of a}} trait that increases fitness. [...] In his article [...] "Evolution of consciousness", John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness (" [...] psychon ... linked to [...] dendron through quantum physics"). [...] Bernard Baars proposed that once in place, this [...] "recursive" [...] circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms. Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality. This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them (e.g. that water in the distance may be a mirage) and behave accordingly, and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends.|$|E

500|$|Tomb Raider was {{critically}} acclaimed. In a 'world exclusive' review, GamesMaster magazine {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 90%, {{as well as the}} [...] "GamesMaster Gold award" [...] (awarded to games that manage a score of 90% or above). The editor regarded the quality of the visuals, the length and depth of the gameplay, and the [...] "spectacular" [...] last third of the game as the highlights. The summary said [...] "sitting back exhausted we were left with just one question dribbling forth from our gaping jaws. How on earth are they going to top this in the sequel? Because of one <b>thing</b> <b>there</b> can be no doubt. Lara is back." [...] IGN's Keza MacDonald also spoke extremely positively, stating that they felt the game was [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "beautifully presented", included [...] "great characterization" [...] and [...] "more depth than you would expect". They gave the game an overall score of 9.1 out of 10, the highest score they have given a game in the series since 1996's Tomb Raider, describing it as [...] "amazing" [...] and concluding that the game [...] "did justice" [...] to both the character and franchise. Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar lauded the location's setting and environment, and expressed that [...] "not one area ever feels like a rehash of another". Taljonick also felt that the game had great pacing, and that it is [...] "unrivaled by any other game in the genre". Furthermore, the reviewer considered Lara's character development as [...] "an integral part" [...] of the whole game's experience, and concluded that Tomb Raider [...] "is a fantastic game and an excellent origin story for one of gaming's original treasure seekers". Australian TV show Good Game praised the game: it was rated 10/10 by both hosts, becoming the eighth game in the show's seven-year run to do so. Giant Bomb gave the game four stars out of five, stating that [...] "Tomb Raiders tone is somewhat at odds with its action, but the reborn Lara Croft seems primed for a successful new adventuring career".|$|E
