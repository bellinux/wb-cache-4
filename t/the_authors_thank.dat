50|$|Professor Wills comments: The only perfect {{textbook}} is an untried textbook, {{but after}} a year of using all three parts in different courses at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I can say we were generally very satisfied. We wanted far more readings than most Latin grammars supply and in this we were not disappointed. In the course of two semesters (in which we covered most of the first two books), students read over 2000 lines of Latin. It is true that almost all of this was written by Balme and Morwood, but after the opening chapters the stories have a high level of Latinity (is this why <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>thank</b> Prof. E.J. Kenney and Dr. Jonathan Powell?) and held student interest.|$|E
