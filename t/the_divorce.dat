5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging {{her to have}} <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the contributions of college students' perceptions of family of origin health and self-esteem to their perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother. It was hypothesized that individuals who hold more positive views of their family of origin health will also view themselves and, consequently, <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother more positively. Participants were 170 college students, 113 of whom lived only with their biological parents, and 57 of whom lived at sometime in their lives with a divorced single mother. Four instruments were used to collect the data, including the Family of Origin Health Scale (Hovestadt et al., 1985), the Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), <b>the</b> Perception of <b>Divorced</b> Mother Scale (Ganong & Coleman, 1983), and a demographic questionnaire. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were used in data analyses. Generally, results indicated that family type made no major impact on participants' perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother. Among participants in the biological parent group and <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother group, family of origin health significantly predicted more positive perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother. In this analysis, the regression model for the biological parent group was significant, while for <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother group it was not. Self-esteem was not found to contribute significantly to participants' perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother, and thus did not mediate the relationship between family of origin health and perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother. Finally, among the biological parent group, amount of interaction with single parent families headed by a divorced single mother significantly predicted more positive perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother. Among <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother group, however, amount of time lived in a single parent family headed by a divorced mother {{did not significantly predict}} their perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> single mother...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study aims {{to know how}} the psychological dynamic of Subjective Well‐Being (SWB) of children is from divorced parents. This research involved three children from divorced parents as subject. The subjects’ ages were between 18 ‐ 21 years old. Data was collected through in‐depth interview, participative observation, and self report method. Findings indicated that there were three conditions of subjective well‐being of children from <b>divorced</b> parents. <b>The</b> first condition is the condition before <b>the</b> parent`s <b>divorced,</b> whereas <b>the</b> second and the third are the condition after <b>the</b> parent`s <b>divorced.</b> <b>The</b> first condition shows that children from divorced parents have low level of subjective well‐being before their parents divorced. It is mainly because of the parental conflict and the low level of family to spend time together which araised motional attachment. In the second condition, children from divorced parents still have low level of subjective well‐being that mainly because of <b>the</b> parental <b>divorced,</b> parental attitude that never told to their child about <b>the</b> <b>divorced,</b> and <b>the</b> decrease of parental attachment following <b>the</b> <b>divorced.</b> <b>The</b> third condition, children from <b>divorced</b> parents show <b>the</b> higher level of subjective well‐being that mainly because of the acceptance of children for <b>the</b> parents <b>divorced.</b> This acceptance leads children from divorced parents feeling positive affect and life satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Structures of <b>divorced</b> {{populations in}} <b>the</b> Czech Republic and Slovakia {{according}} to Census 2011 Abstract: This Bachelor Thesis is striving to characterize <b>the</b> population of <b>divorced</b> in <b>the</b> Czech and Slovak Republics {{on the basis}} of available data from Census which took place in 2011. The age and sex structure of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> is analysed at regional level. Furthermore, potential distinctive features that correlate with the size of population of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> on district or regional level are being searched for. The potential correlating characteristics were chosen based on known risk factors of divorce rate, which were published in demographic or sociological literature. According to assumptions the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> on <b>the</b> population is higher in the Czech Republic then in Slovakia. Moreover, the Czech population of <b>the</b> <b>divorced</b> is older compared to the one of Slovakia and the average age of divorced is higher for women than men. In the countries there is a contradictory relationship between the relative size of <b>the</b> population of <b>divorced</b> and <b>the</b> educational level of the population. While in the districts in the Czech Republic with greater ratio of university-educated the relative number of divorced decreases, in Slovakia their number is increasing.
