One possibility, now discarded, was to send Cassini on from Saturn to Uranus in an extended mission. Another mission concept proposed was the Uranus orbiter and probe concept, evaluated around 2010. Uranus was also examined {{as part of}} one <b>trajectory</b> <b>for</b> a precursor interstellar probe concept, Innovative Interstellar Explorer.|$|E
5|$|Once {{classified}} a super typhoon, Gordon {{acquired a}} slight northerly component to its track and maintained a general west-northwestward <b>trajectory</b> <b>for</b> {{the remainder of}} its existence. Late on July15, Gordon made landfall in northern Luzon, Philippines, at peak intensity. Remaining over land for several hours, the storm quickly weakened before entering the South China Sea. The system maintained minimal typhoon status as it developed a large, ragged eye by July17. Slight weakening took place hours before Gordon made landfall as a strong tropical storm near Zhanjiang in Southern China on July18. Briefly moving over the warm, shallow waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, Gordon's convective structure tripled in size; however, the system continued to weaken. Later that day, the storm made its final landfall in southern Guangxi Province. Once onshore, Gordon quickly weakened and was last noted on July19 by the JMA over southern Guangxi.|$|E

25|$|In coevolution, {{where the}} {{existence}} of one species is tightly {{bound up with the}} life of another species, new or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding features in the other species. These relationships are intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a <b>trajectory</b> <b>for</b> millions of years, as has occurred in the relationship between flowering plants and pollinating insects.|$|E
25|$|The Orion Rel-nav Sensor {{was mounted}} on the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) in Trajectory Control Sensor slot 1 and on an Adaptive Payload Carrier in the bay 3 port of the Payload Bay. For the STORRM Detailed Test Objective (DTO), after Endeavour undocked, it {{completed}} its normal fly-around of the station. The crew then guided Endeavour back towards the station, flying a nominal orbiter <b>trajectory</b> <b>for</b> docking to the ISS's Pressurized Mating Adapter-2. However, the shuttle did not actually dock with the ISS again; instead, it was positioned below the station.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} few years, however, {{researchers}} like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work The Handbook of Solitude, the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite {{a variety of other}} faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude {{is more than just a}} personal <b>trajectory</b> <b>for</b> one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.|$|E

500|$|To {{the north}} of the bunker, the Germans erected a bomb-proof power station with a [...] {{generating}} capacity. The site was initially powered from the main electricity grid, but it was intended that it would have its own independent power source to minimise the likelihood of disruption.

A Giant Würzburg radar system was installed there to follow the trajectories of V-2s being launched from Watten.

40|$|Automatic chopper gun <b>trajectory</b> {{generation}} <b>for</b> {{spray forming}} is highly desirable for today's automotive manufacturing. Generating chopper gun <b>trajectories</b> <b>for</b> free-form surfaces {{to satisfy the}} given requirements is still highly challenging due to the complex geometry of free-form surfaces and the spray gun model. A CAD-guided chopper gun <b>trajectory</b> generation system <b>for</b> both uniform and nonuniform material distribution of free-form surfaces has been developed in our previous work. A material distribution model is also presented. To verify the developed algorithms, experiments were performed. In this paper, the experimental results are presented and compared with the simulation results.

Also, the material distribution model can be used to compute the material distribution for free-form surfaces.

500|$|Steered by a {{ridge to}} the west, the nascent Tropical Storm Elita turned northward over its {{previous}} path, an unusual <b>trajectory</b> <b>for</b> the Mozambique Channel. The convection fluctuated until January28, when a curved rainband developed and quickly organized into an eyewall; this followed {{a decrease in}} wind shear. Another ridge to the northeast blocked the northward movement, and Elita turned to the east-southeast toward {{the west coast of}} Madagascar. Around 15:00UTC on January28, the storm made landfall at Bombetoka Bay, or about 30km (20mi) southwest of Mahajanga. The airport there recorded 10minute sustained winds of 126km/h (78mph), and on that basis, the MFR upgraded Elita to tropical cyclone status in post-season analysis. This made Elita the first tropical cyclone to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. While Elita was active, both the JTWC and the MFR estimated an intensity of 110km/h (70mph) at the first landfall.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the synchrocyclotron is the isochronous cyclotron, which has a magnetic field that increases with radius, rather than with time. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons, but require azimuthal variations in the field strength to provide a strong focusing effect and keep the particles captured in their spiral <b>trajectory.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, an isochronous cyclotron is also called an [...] "AVF (azimuthal varying field) cyclotron". This solution for focusing the particle beam was proposed by L. H. Thomas in 1938.|$|E

2500|$|Through gradual change, the eyespots {{of species}} living in well-lit environments {{depressed}} into a shallow [...] "cup" [...] shape, {{the ability to}} slightly discriminate directional brightness was achieved by using the angle at which the light hit certain cells to identify the source.

However, the ancestors of modern hagfish, thought to be the protovertebrate were evidently pushed to very deep, dark waters, where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators, and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot, which gathers more light than a flat or concave one.
