But I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to do}} it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E

Meanwhile, their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials, and {{spent two years in}} jail.

[...] Most of The Terminators action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed.

[...] Thus, Roosevelt suggested placing the buildings on the National Mall (Potomac Park) along B Street (renamed Constitution Avenue in 1931), near the Lincoln Memorial. [...] Roosevelt wanted them to be ugly wooden buildings, so that people would want to tear them down right away after World War I. [...] However, to make the buildings more fire resistant, concrete and steel materials were recommended. Roosevelt later expressed regret for allowing these building to be constructed, saying in 1941, [...] "I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ever be let into the Gates of Heaven, because I had been responsible for desecrating the parks of Washington." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album.

[...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in.

500|$|O'Hara {{was offered}} roles in The Razor's Edge (1946), which went to Tierney, John Wayne's film Tycoon (1947), which went to Laraine Day, and Bob Hope's The Paleface, which went to Jane Russell. She {{turned down the}} role in The Paleface as she {{was going through a}} {{turbulent}} period in her personal life and [...] "didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be able to laugh every day and have fun". She later deeply regretted turning it down and confessed that she'd made a [...] "terrible mistake". In 1947, O'Hara starred opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Shireen in the adventure film Sinbad the Sailor. O'Hara plays a glamorous adventuress who assists Sinbad (Fairbanks) locate the hidden treasure of Alexander the Great. She found the scenario to be [...] "ridiculous", but stated that it made a [...] "pot of money for RKO– action-adventures almost always did". Malone wrote: [...] "O'Hara looks splendid and gets to wear some of the most stunning costumes of her career—a different one in almost every scene—but her dialogue is floridly empty. She exudes potential in early scenes, where her air of sybaritic slyness seems promise she'll be something more than window dressing", but thought the film [...] "totally lacked drama". The critic from The New York Times thought that O'Hara excessive costume changes made watching her an [...] "exhausting" [...] experience".|$|E

[...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it.
