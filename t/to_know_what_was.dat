5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by {{people who may have}} been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> actually said and what was recreated {{in the aftermath of the}} successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E

Governmental regulatory agencies at that time indicated that the extent of contaminants on the entire property remained unknown. The report indicated {{that it was necessary}} to go down more than two feet below ground (soil had only been tested superficially at one inch deep) <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> really brewing beneath the surface.

25|$|M0100: Four {{months after}} the Macintosh debut, the Apple IIc was {{introduced}} {{with the addition of}} an optional mouse to manipulate standard 80 column text. The mouse was similar to the Macintosh mouse, though it was in a creamy-beige color that co-ordinated with the IIc's bright off-white case and had a slightly modified design which was sleeker than the Macintosh's blockier shape. It also was uniformly the same color, eliminating the Mac & Lisa's contrasting taupe accents on the mouse button and cable. Unlike the Macintosh, the IIc Mouse shared a dual purpose port with gaming devices like joysticks. In order for the IIc <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> plugged into it, its mouse had to send the appropriate signal. Despite these differences, it carried exactly the same model number as the Macintosh version.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 {{there was}} a {{significant}} increase in the number of UFO reports received by the USAF Blue Book project, tasked with investigating such reports at the time. This wave included widely reported incidents over Washington DC in July, over the weekends of July 19-20 and 26-27. CIA historian Gerald Haines noted “A massive build-up of sightings over the United States in 1952, especially in July, alarmed the Truman administration. On 19 and 20 July, radar scopes at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked mysterious blips. On 27 July, the blips reappeared. The Air Force scrambled interceptor aircraft to investigate, but they found nothing. The incidents, however, caused headlines across the country. The White House wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening…”. The reference to White House interest is consistent with a telephone call Captain (later Major) Edward Ruppelt, Blue Book Project Director at the time, received from Brigadier General Landry, Truman’s military aide, on the July 28, inquiring as to the causes of the Washington reports of the previous days.|$|E

Ned turns for a second, seemingly having heard Bran's voice, but eventually continues inside, before the Three-Eyed Raven pulls Bran out of the vision. Back in the cave, Bran demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in the tower.

At the San Diego Comic Con 2014, Lawless' role {{was revealed}} to be that of Isabelle Hartley, a longtime S.H.I.E.L.D. veteran. About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like this person was a real equal to Coulson.

500|$|Yeats {{was raised}} {{a member of}} the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time {{undergoing}} a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening in the world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent {{around the turn of the}} century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered." ...|$|E
500|$|Every November, Vukovar's {{authorities}} hold {{four days}} of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a [...] "Procession of Memory" [...] held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by {{tens of thousands of}} people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term [...] "Liberation Day" [...] has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply [...] "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or šajkača. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they feel great stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to [...] "safety". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an [...] "invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group." ...|$|E
