500|$|Madonna, who {{was busy}} with True Blue and {{shooting}} for the comedy film Shanghai Surprise, was contacted by Kleinman to ask about her approval of the shot footage. She felt that the video [...] "needed a proper introduction. I asked [...] Foley darling <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> saying something for adding it before the concert starts." [...] Foley, who directed the music video of her song [...] "Live to Tell", shot an introduction which was added {{at the beginning of}} the video. It portrayed Madonna in her first image makeover, with platinum blond curls, and conservative wardrobe. Madonna wanted to include a summation of her biography—which was used at the beginning of The Virgin Tour—to be added with the footage. Hence, with the footage, Madonna's voice was heard, declaring, ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{particular}} {{aspect of}} Gordon's personality that stood out was his death wish as everyone {{who knew him}} was convinced {{that he wanted to}} die. When a Lebanese merchant visited Gordon in the evening, the Ansar began an artillery bombardment, leading the frightened merchant to suggest that perhaps Gordon ought to dim the lights to avoid drawing enemy fire down on the palace. The merchant recalled Gordon's response: [...] "He called up the guard and gave the orders <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> if I moved" [...] and ordered all of the lamps in the palace to be lit up as brightly as possible. Gordon defiantly told the merchant: [...] "Go tell all the people of Khartoum that Gordon fears nothing, for God has created him without fear!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} over Sierra's suspension {{and the subsequent}} trial drew local, national and international media attention. Initial reaction to Sierra's actions from the local media was unsympathetic. This was later attributed by Sierra's lawyers and Dan Radmacher – editor of the Charleston Gazette – to Principal Mann's repetition in his comments to the Gazette of Jacob Reed's statements concerning Sierra's message. [...] Sierra claims that callers to local radio stations [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> in the head. They wanted to send me to another country." [...] The Charleston Daily Mail praised Mann's decision, calling Sierra's [...] "thoroughly egocentric exercise" [...] of her constitutional rights [...] "tiresome". The Daily Mail expanded on its position in a July 15, 2002 editorial; while noting Justice Lewis Powell's declaration that full constitutional rights did not apply equally in school as in criminal justice, the paper commented that [...] "students do have rights {{as long as they}} are not disrupting the education of others", and that while [...] Sierra's request to form an anarchist club [...] "may have seemed bizarre and even oxymoronic", Principal Mann ought to have permitted it [...] "since it would not harm or impinge upon the rights of others". It went on to praise the jury's decision that Sierra had no constitutional right to wear her T-shirts to class or to disobey the authority of Mann but that she did have the right to express her opinions after class, calling it [...] "the essence of Americanism … a great system that makes anarchy look silly".|$|E

6000|$|... "Miss Withersteen, I {{was alone}} {{all night with}} the herd. At {{daylight}} this mornin' the rustlers rode down. They began <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> at <b>me</b> on sight. They chased me hard an' far, burnin' powder all the time, but I got away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a time," [...] the Marquis reflected, [...] "when {{several of}} my Irish tenants used <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> at <b>me</b> every Saturday night from behind a hedge. It {{was not in the}} least a {{dangerous}} operation, and I presume it brought them some relief. With Vont, however, things would be different. I remember him distinctly as a most wonderful shot." ...|$|R

6000|$|Simmo was begging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot,</b> <b>shoot,</b> telling <b>me</b> excitedly that [...] "Ol' Dev'l," [...] as {{he called}} him, would be more {{dangerous}} now than ever, if I let him get away; but I only drove the canoe in closer to the splashing, grunting uproar among the shadows under the bank.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what is a}} poor devil to think? You blow hot {{and cold}} all in a breath. I'm sick and ill and feverish," [...] he {{continued}} with self-pity, [...] "and now even you find me a trouble. I wish <b>to</b> God they'd <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> and make an end.

5000|$|After the Ustaše's Velebit {{uprising}} in November 1932, Alexander said through an intermediary to the Italian government, [...] "If {{you want to}} have serious riots in Yugoslavia or cause a regime change, you need <b>to</b> kill <b>me.</b> <b>Shoot</b> at <b>me</b> and be sure you have finished me off, because that's {{the only way to make}} changes in Yugoslavia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think the}} Boers would trouble <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me,</b> Sir. If {{you had been}} here I would have drawn the blinds and shut the {{shutters}} too," [...] you answered, laughing again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{remember}} now!" [...] she said, starting up. [...] "Those {{men were}} here, {{and they were}} going <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me.</b> One--two--and then he fired, and it seemed that I fell dead. Am I not wounded?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The two {{men looked}} {{at each other for a}} few seconds. Stangrave longed to say, [...] "You intend <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me?</b> Then try at once;" [...] but he was ashamed, of course, to make use of words which he had so accidentally overheard.|$|E
60|$|During my stay in Borneo I had no hunter <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> for <b>me</b> regularly, and, being myself fully {{occupied}} with insects, I {{did not succeed}} in obtaining a very good collection of the birds or Mammalia, many of which, however, are well known, being identical with species found in Malacca. Among the Mammalia were five squirrels,and two tigercats--the Gymnurus Rafflesii, which looks like a cross between a pig and a polecat, and the Cynogale Bennetti--a rare, otter-like animal, with very broad muzzle clothed with long bristles.|$|R
50|$|López is also {{preparing}} <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> Moctezuma & <b>Me,</b> with {{a script}} by herself. Moctezuma & Me is a bitter-sweet comedy {{about what it}} really {{means to be a}} man in today's Mexico; in October 2015 she received the Eficine Film Grant to finance the project. Principal photography will begin in October 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Three fighters {{came after}} me. The first one missed {{and the second}} also missed. When the third one came by I was too low for him <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> at <b>me.</b> When I hit the ground a burst of machine gun was fired at me. I hit the dirt fast. Then German {{soldiers}} came and drove me on a motorcycle to a building. On the way we passed a row of dead American airmen, about twelve of them covered with blood soaked parachutes. I knew they were shot dead on the way down.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time Captain Hannock was letting forth {{a flood of}} vile {{language}} at everything and everybody. He {{wanted to know who}} had aided me to escape and he threatened <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> if I did not turn around and swim back.|$|E
60|$|Somebody put {{his arms}} round my neck, and my nose touched a warm cheek. I opened my eyes. It was not {{the man with the}} gun come <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me.</b> It was Peter. He was {{breathing}} very hard, and he had been crying.|$|E
6000|$|Ridgeley merely said: [...] "Yes, {{he seemed}} to me to be more than a common hand. But, all the same, it won't be two weeks before he'll be in here as drunk as a wild cat, wanting <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> for holding back his money." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another neighbour, Sivei Ah Chong, {{repeatedly}} {{shouted at}} Khan {{to drop the}} knife, but eventually was forced to smash {{a piece of wood}} onto Khan's head. Khan then fled down the street, yelling [...] "Call the police, call the police, I want them <b>to</b> come and <b>shoot</b> <b>me,</b> I want <b>to</b> die today" [...] and attempted to attack a responding police officer before being subdued with tasers and arrested.|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>to</b> the <b>shooting</b> at <b>me</b> in the kloof, I {{have none}} except God who saw you," [...] I answered. [...] "As to the plot that you laid against me among the Zulus, as it chances, however, there is one, Kambula, the captain who {{was sent to}} take me as you had arranged, and who now {{commands}} our escort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there," [...] {{interrupted}} the Reverend Frank, [...] "be off. The troopers will soon return.

Be off, I say!" ...|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. Ingrate! I supply {{you with}} free books; {{and the use}} you make of them is to persuade {{yourself}} that it's a fine thing <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me.</b> [He throws himself doggedly back into his chair]. I'll never give another penny to a Free Library.|$|E
60|$|THE BURGLAR. He don't {{belong to}} my branch, Captain. There's two sets in the family: the {{thinking}} Dunns and the drinking Dunns, each going their own ways. I'm a drinking Dunn: he's a thinking Dunn. But that didn't {{give him any}} right <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Heer Pereira seemed {{extremely}} doubtful; so doubtful, indeed, {{that the}} Boers {{began to laugh}} at him. In the end he grew rather angry, {{and said that he}} was willing <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> at bucks or swallows, or fireflies, or anything else I liked.|$|E
6000|$|The three archers named {{stood at}} the further end of the poop, {{balancing}} themselves with feet widely spread and bows drawn, until {{the heads of the}} cloth-yard arrows were level with the centre of the stave. [...] "You are the surer, Watkin," [...] said Aylward, standing by them with shaft upon string. [...] "Do you take the rogue with the red coif. You two bring down the man with the head-piece, and I will hold myself ready if you miss. Ma foi! they are about <b>to</b> loose her. <b>Shoot,</b> <b>mes</b> garcons, or you will be too late." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bassler later {{credited}} his improved batting in 1924 to {{his teammate}} Bobby Veach. Bassler recalled:"I {{was a dead}} left-field hitter and all a good pitcher had <b>to</b> do was <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> a fast high ball, inside, and I'd pop up. I found Veach used a little fuller swing than I against this delivery, always keeping his wrist behind the point of contact with the ball. About the middle of 1924, after experimenting, I landed upon {{the combination of a}} big-handled bat of light Cuban wood and a full swing patterned after Veach. Then suddenly they began to line into right and center for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|David Crosby {{published}} a memoir in 1988, saying the following about {{his use of}} heroin with Elliot:"It was always the bad drug, always the worst. It got a little more open around the time that Cass and I were doing it, but it wasn't something you told people about. It wasn't anything you bragged about, you know. ... Me and Cass Elliot were closet junk takers and used to get loaded with each other a lot. We loved London because there was pharmaceutical heroin available in drugstores there. ... Government the United Kingdom dope, in these injectable tablets that you crushed and dissolved in order <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> them. <b>Me</b> and Cass used to just mash them up and snort the powder. ... Cass took lots of pills, usually from the opiate family: Dilaudid, Demerol, Percodan, downers of all sorts, and {{we did a lot}} of coke together".|$|R
6000|$|... "No. No, I don't blame you. But you'll {{get your}} control back, soon. Don't worry. This {{is only a}} {{temporary}} expedient, taking you off this way. It was something I didn't contemplate. I forgot that orders would be given out <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> on sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nashville on Cumberland. Jackson'sh county sholicitor,--devil of a man. I'll tell you, Davy," [...] he continued, laying an {{uncertain}} {{hand on my}} shoulder and speaking with great earnestness, [...] "I had Chicashaw horse--Jackson'd Virginia thoroughbred--had a race--'n' Jackson wanted <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> 'n' I wanted to shoot Jackson.

6000|$|... "I shall say nothing," [...] {{continued}} Sotillo, {{fixing the}} motionless and powerless Mitchell with an angry but uneasy stare. [...] "I shall {{say nothing of}} your treacherous attempt to get possession of my revolver <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> while I was trying to treat you with consideration you did not deserve. You have forfeited your life. Your only hope is in my clemency." ...|$|E
5000|$|As a transfer, Clarke {{had to sit}} out a {{year before}} being {{eligible}} to play. He used the redshirt year {{to work on his}} game, practicing against Butler's Ronald Nored, who was considered one of the top defenders in the country. [...] "I'm not the quickest guy so playing against a defender like that, you find ways to get by, you find different ways to come off a screen," [...] he remarked. NCAA regulations kept Clarke from traveling with the team for road games, so he practiced alone in Hinkle Fieldhouse, refusing to leave until he had made 500 shots on the night. [...] To facilitate his workouts, Clarke persuaded head coach Brad Stevens to give him a key to the building. [...] "At night it would just be me and the ball and basket", he recalls. [...] "That was all that mattered <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Shooting</b> puts <b>me</b> at ease, it puts me at peace, it takes everything else off my mind." [...] Clarke describes the experience as [...] "definitely one of the toughest years," [...] but credits his teammates and his faith for getting him through it.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel that}} made Jeong You Jeong widely known among readers was <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me</b> in the Heart (내 심장을 쏴라). This novel {{is very similar}} to Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest in terms of the {{narrative}} structure and character profiles, as if it could be an homage. Jeong You Jeong satirizes the whole Korean society through the setting of a mental hospital, and tells the story of two young men attempting <b>to</b> escape. Interestingly, <b>Shoot</b> <b>me</b> in the Heart (내 심장을 쏴라), which was selected as the winner of the ‘Segye Literature Award’, was supported by younger judges, but was not favorably praised by older judges. Because of this, it’s been said that there were two secret voting sessions. Literary critic Kim Hwayoung and writer Hwang Sok-yong, the judges at the time, had said that the work had a weakness in that the story was “hard to get through in the beginning,’ but also that it “makes one have sincere doubts through the metaphor of how life goes round in circles despite constantly dreaming and attempting escape”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I heard {{also the}} voice of Zikali {{speaking}} from beneath. He called on you to come out <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> at <b>me,</b> and the man whom I took to be the king, ordered you to obey. You appeared from behind the tree, and I was certain from the look upon your face that at that distance you did not know who I was in my strange and glittering raiment. You lifted the pistol and I was terribly afraid, for I had seen you shoot with it before on the verandah of the Temple and knew well {{that you do not}} miss. Very nearly I screamed out to you, but remembered and was silent, thinking that after all it did not much matter if I died, except for the sake of Maurice here. Also by now I guessed that I was being used to deceive those men before me into some terrible act, and that if I died, at least they would be undeceived.|$|R
