Serving with No.22 (City of Sydney) Squadron from July 1936, he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) on a short-service commission in May 1938. He was then assigned to No.1 Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, as an instructor. In January 1939, he was posted to Britain to attend <b>the</b> <b>Specialists</b> Signals Course at Royal Air Force College Cranwell, and was promoted to flight lieutenant in September.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of Tropical Depression Fourteen, the southern Caribbean Sea was under a large area of low pressure. On October 30, satellite imagery showed that the area of pressure was beginning to form into a tropical disturbance. A reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled for the next morning to investigate the forming system, but by 1400 UTC on October 31, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida had upgraded the system to a tropical depression based on the imagery and surface data. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>specialists</b> at the Hurricane Center believed that this was its most developed stage of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of <b>the</b> <b>specialists</b> tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} for four troops (A, B, C and F), {{headquarters}} and attached specialists, {{to be divided}} into two groups. Group one under the command of Major Mills-Roberts would land at Orange One and consisted of C Troop, a section from ATroop, the mortar detachment and some of <b>the</b> <b>specialists.</b> They would scale the cliffs and form a fire base in the woods in front of the battery to support the assault. Group two commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lovat would land at Orange Two and take out the beach defences. B and F Troops would then advance move along the river and assault the battery from the rear. The rest of ATroop would be the reserve, positioned between the two beaches. After the attack Group two would withdraw through Group one and be picked up by the waiting LCAs on Orange One beach.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>specialists</b> {{fell into}} three categories. First there were species describers, then specialists in species {{recognition}} and then specialists in gross taxonomy. There were however considerable degrees of overlap. Also then, as now, few could entirely resist {{the lure of}} groups other than their own, and this was especially true of those in small countries where they were the sole 'expert', and many famous specialists in one order also worked on others. Hence, for instance, many works which began as butterfly faunas were completed as general regional works, often collaboratively.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} market {{microstructure}} model to examine specialist’s strategic participation decisions in a security market {{where there are}} noise traders, limit order traders, an insider and a specialist. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>specialist’s</b> participation rate depends on {{the depth of the}} limit book and its uncertainty. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>specialist</b> has incentives to trade against the market trend when the limit book depth is low and to trade with the market trend when the depth is high. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>specialist’s</b> participation rate is positively related to the limit book depth uncertainty and the asset price volatility, but is negative related to the average trading volume.

40|$|There is a {{significant}} disparity between theoretical and empirical models of <b>the</b> <b>Specialist's</b> adjustment for inventory risk.

By partitioning <b>the</b> <b>Specialist</b> actions as active or passive, conditioned on the Price Continuity Rule, this study shows that <b>the</b> <b>Specialist</b> engages in active inventory rebalancing throughout the trading day. The paper finds that <b>the</b> <b>Specialist's</b> obligations - set by the NYSE - of achieving price continuity and smooth price changes come at {{a significant}} cost for <b>the</b> <b>Specialist.</b> However, he manages to mitigate this cost through his own actions when the rules are not binding.

25|$|The Italian Corpo Aeronautico Militare (Military Aviation Corps) {{was formed}} {{as part of}} the part of the Regio Esercito (Royal Army) on 7 January 1915, {{incorporating}} the Aviators Flights Battalion (airplanes), <b>the</b> <b>Specialists</b> Battalion (airships) and the Ballonists Battalion. Prior to World War I, Italy had pioneered military aviation in the Italo-Turkish War during 1911–1912. Its army also contained one of the world's foremost theorists about the future of military aviation, Giulio Douhet; Douhet also had a practical side, as he was largely responsible for the development of Italy's Caproni bombers starting in 1913. Italy also had the advantage of a delayed entry into World War I, not starting the fight until 24 May 1915, but took no advantage of it so far as aviation was concerned.|$|E

He personally oversaw the pledge drive, collecting private donations and public money from the National Bank, the Ministry of Health and Căile Ferate Române, offering free medical services to the donors. Gomoiu also designed much of the building, modifying sketches by the architect Gheorghe Șimotta.

25|$|In 1890, the {{election}} of {{several members of the}} labor-friendly Tennessee Farmers' Alliance among them Governor John P. Buchanan to the state government emboldened miners in the Coal Creek Valley to make several demands. One of the key demands was payment in cash rather than company scrip, which could either be used only at company-owned stores with marked up prices or redeemed for cash at a percentage of its value. Miners also demanded they be allowed to use their own checkweighmen <b>the</b> <b>specialists</b> who weighed the coal and determined how much a particular miner had earned instead of checkweighmen hired by the company. Since state laws already barred scrip payment and company-hired checkweighmen, most mine owners accepted the demands, though they {{were in the midst of}} an economic downturn. However, the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC), which operated a mine near Briceville, rejected the demands, and on April 1, 1891, shut down operations. Two months later, the company demanded its miners sign an iron-clad contract before returning to work. The miners refused.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe, however, {{still had}} their captain Taibu in, and {{joined by the}} hard-hitting Coventry {{he set out to}} give Zimbabwe a {{competitive}} score. The pair batted responsibly, yet did not stay away from punishing the balls delivered on an errant length, and in 11 overs the pair added 60 runs as Zimbabwe moved to 110 for 3 at the halfway mark, with Taibu on 51. Sourav Ganguly even brought himself on to stop the Zimbabwean onslaught, but after delivering two no-balls and a wide and conceding 24 runs in four overs he wisely left bowling to <b>the</b> <b>specialists.</b> Yadav got smashed early on, but recovered well to bowl a maiden over and take the wicket of Taibu for 71. However, that brought the hard-hitting Blignaut to the crease, and he and Coventry attacked the bowlers with venom. Coventry had a particular love for Murali Kartik, whom he took for one six and one four in an over, before finally hitting one lofted straight shot too much, and Kartik could hold the catch – gone for 74, his first ODI fifty. The partnership of Coventry and Blignaut had added 61 from 49 deliveries.|$|E
