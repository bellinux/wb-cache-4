50|$|In {{an initial}} bid {{to contain the}} situation, dams were set up to impede the flow of fuel {{downstream}} and a ditch was dug in order to coax the fuel back to a single point for pumping. EAPC was instructed <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>dry</b> the puddles of jet fuel that had formed {{on the ground and}} to transfer the affected soil to a treatment plant for decontamination. Experts consulted to evaluate the extent of the damage estimated that cleaning up the area of the spill would take weeks to months, with fears that if the situation was not resolved by wintertime, rainfall would exacerbate it. A hydrologist from the University of Haifa estimated that, should it emerge that the 25-meter-deep aquifer became polluted, it could take years for the area to be rehabilitated and cleansed of contaminants.|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} investigation of an indirect solar dryer integrated with phase change material {{has been carried}} out for drying Valeriana Jatamansi. The experimentation has been performed under the climatic conditions of Himalayan region, Solan (latitude − 30. 91 °N, longitude − 77. 09 °E), Himachal Pradesh (India) in the month of October-November 2016. Paraffin RT- 42 {{has been used as a}} phase change material in the dryer. Using this system, the moisture content of rhizomes reduced from 89 % to 9 % in 5 days as compared <b>to</b> heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> and shade drying, which took 8 days and 14 days, respectively. Results of present study infer that the drying time using phase change material in this setup has reduced by 37. 50 % and 64. 29 % when compared <b>to</b> heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> and shade drying, respectively. The dried rhizomes obtained are of superior quality in terms of colour, texture, aroma and bio-medical constituents.

50|$|A typical {{reason for}} {{slipping}} a vessel is {{so as to}} clean and paint it, and in particular, to apply anti-fouling protection to the hull.

50|$|Before {{the lakes}} {{on either side}} of De Rijp were <b>pumped</b> <b>dry,</b> De Rijp was a port town with {{merchant}} ships that travelled the high seas on trade routes. The town had a medium-sized herring fleet, and searched for whales with larger ships. Rijper vessels travelled regularly to Spitsbergen. After the success of the polders near Alkmaar and Egmond, plans were formed to make polders of the other lakes in North Holland, including the ones on both sides of De Rijp. In 1605 De Rijp split off from Graft and became a relief center for the effort <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> the Beemster <b>dry.</b> The project was run by the architect-engineer Jan Leeghwater, who had been born in De Rijp and even designed the Town hall.|$|R

500|$|The {{contract}} {{called for}} the complete construction of the bridge, including the approaches {{on each side of}} the river and four piers with each consisting of two cylindrical columns of reinforced concrete. Construction of the bridge was complicated by the contract which stipulated that concrete had <b>to</b> be <b>pumped</b> <b>dry,</b> the concrete of each cylinder had to be poured in [...] "one continuous operation" [...] and that the wooden piles for the pier must project at least six feet into the concrete base. These stipulations required the use of a cofferdam to deposit the concrete, but boring in the river showed that it did not have a suitable bottom upon which to build. Tompkins would have to construct a [...] thick artificial bottom in order to proceed. To deposit in accordance with the contract, a tremie would be needed. A tremie is a pipe that concrete is passed through so it doesn't contact the water and disintegrate.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a technological system offering a resource of marine water (desalinated or not), through devices already {{used to fight}} marine erosion.

This technology produces an high quantity of clean water, that can also be desalinated through reverse osmosis. Beach drainage needs a low quantity of energy that can be produced by renewable sources, such as photovoltaic panels and micro wind mills. This way it is possibile to configure integrated technological systems useful to restore the littoral prism and to supply a considerable water resource for large parts of coastal areas. The strategy allows to save a hudge amount of drinking water, that now is consumed even when it is not really necessary.

50|$|She {{was renamed}} again, {{this time to}} La Jenelle. The new owners brought her to Port Hueneme, California, where they {{intended}} to sell her. Some say that plans were underway to make her a floating restaurant/casino. Others claim {{she was to be}} sold to an Indonesian shipping firm, but neither plan materialized. By 1970, she was anchored outside the harbor to avoid expensive docking fees while efforts were made to find a buyer. On April 13, her luck ran out. That particular day was blustery, with a northwest gale ripping the tops off the waves. Seas broke everywhere, and nearly everyone was in port. La Jenelles starboard anchor - the only one out - began to drag. There were only two crewmen aboard, and they were unable to stop her drift. Only 23 minutes later, she struck the sandy beach west of the Port Hueneme breakwater, her stern just missing the rocks. La Jenelle began to list as she took on water. The crew stayed aboard, attempting <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> her <b>dry</b> so she could be righted, but the seas were pouring in from many smashed portholes and windows making their efforts fruitless. A helicopter arrived to rescue them as the ship settled further into the sand.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, the Swedish Air Board {{constructed}} {{an unusual}} test facility at Flygmotor. This was an engine test facility, {{a form of}} wind tunnel, which could operate at high inlet pressures, thus high Reynolds numbers. This tunnel was unique in being water-powered. A sealed underground chamber was blasted out of the granite beneath the Göta Canal. When the canal was allowed to flood the chamber, air was driven from it at high pressure and through the test chamber. A supersonic test of an engine could be carried out for around 10 minutes, after which it took 24 hours <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> the chamber <b>dry</b> again. Use of this test facility was shared with Rolls-Royce, who used it in 1953 to develop the afterburners of the Avon RA7 engine for the Supermarine Swift F3 and Saab 32 Lansen. The Avon RA14 afterburner would also be tested here, produced as the Flygmotor RM6B for the Saab 35 Draken.|$|R

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> is an efficient method of drying for <b>drying</b> industries. Heat <b>pumps</b> deliver more heat during the drying process than the work input to the compressor. Heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> is a more advanced method than the traditional South African industrial and agricultural drying methods, such as direct/indirect sunlight, wood burning, fossil fuel burning, electrical heating and diesel engine heating. Heat pump dryers provide high energy efficiency with controllable temperature, air flow and air humidity and have significant energy-saving potential. In the last decade the market for heat pump systems for water heating and space cooling/heating has grown in South Africa, but the development of heat pumps for industrial and agricultural drying is very slow.
