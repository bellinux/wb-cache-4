25|$|Before {{the end of}} the 16th century, the Portuguese {{merchant}} fleets {{had reached}} China (where they founded the commercial colony of Macau), as well as the island archipelagos of present-day Indonesia and Japan. They established <b>the</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> of the Eastern trade route and made commercial agreements with the chiefs and kings in Angola and Mozambique. A large colonial empire was consolidated by Afonso de Albuquerque, his armed forces securing those ports on the Indian Ocean in locations convenient for ships outbound from Lisbon against competition from the Turks and Arabs. Local territories were generally not seized, excepting the ports that carried on a profitable trade with the natives. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the world, Pedro Álvares Cabral had arrived at Brazil in 1500.|$|E
25|$|As the Portuguese {{merchant}} fleets established <b>the</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> of the Eastern trade {{route and}} made commercial agreements with their rulers, Lisbon {{gained access to}} the sources of products it exclusively sold {{to the rest of}} Europe for many years: in addition to African products including pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, herbs, and cotton fabrics, as well as diamonds from Malabar in India transported on the Carreira da Índia ("India Run"), it sold Moluccan spices, Ming porcelain and silk from China, slaves from Mozambique, brazilwood and Brazilian sugar. Lisbon also traded in fish (mainly salted cod from the Grand Banks), dried fruit, and wine. Other Portuguese cities, like Porto and Lagos, contributed to foreign trade only marginally, the country's commerce being practically limited to the exports and imports of Lisbon. The city still controlled much of the commerce of Antwerp through its depot there, which exported fine fabrics to the rest of Europe. The German and Italian merchants, seeing their trade routes, by land {{in the case of the}} first, and by the Mediterranean sea in the second, mostly abandoned, founded large trading houses in Lisbon for re-exporting goods to Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|Believing, {{along with}} Lincoln, that the U.S. needed a naval {{base in the}} Caribbean, in January 1865, Seward offered to {{purchase}} the Danish West Indies (today the United States Virgin Islands). [...] Late that year, Seward sailed for the Caribbean on a naval vessel. Among <b>the</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies, where Seward admired the large, easily defended harbor. Another stop was in the Dominican Republic, where he opened talks to obtain Samaná Bay. When Congress reconvened in December 1866, Seward caused a sensation by entering the chamber of the House of Representatives and sitting down with the administration's enemy, Congressman Stevens, persuading him to support an appropriation for more money to expedite the purchase of Samaná, and sent his son Frederick to the Dominican Republic to negotiate a treaty. [...] Both attempts fell through; the Senate, in the dying days of the Johnson administration, failed to ratify a treaty {{for the purchase of}} the Danish possessions, while negotiations with the Dominican Republic were not successful.|$|E

On 7 January 1941, Wichita departed Hampton Roads for Guantanamo, arriving four days later. She participated in fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean through March and took part in practice amphibious landings at Puerto Rico. She returned to the United States, docking at the New York Navy Yard, on 23 March. Wichita went to sea again on 6 April, bound for Bermuda; she reached her destination two days later.

He wrote a letter to Wang Tao, inviting him to come to Scotland to continue assisting in the translation of more Chinese classics. [...] Wang Tao boarded a ship and departed from Hong Kong. The ship stopped over at Singapore, Ceylon, Penang, Aden, Messina, and Cairo before reaching Marseille. The voyage from Hong Kong to Marseille took more than forty days.

He visited the Louvre, and also visited the sinologist Stanislas Julien at the Sorbonne. After a short stay of a little under two weeks, Wang Tao crossed the English Channel from Calais to Dover and rode a train to London.

60|$|Their bodies stalked {{brown and}} {{emaciated}} as if dried {{up in the}} sunshine; their lives ran out silently; the homes where they were born, went to rest, and died--flimsy sheds of rushes and coarse grass eked out with a few ragged mats--were hidden out of sight from the open sea. No glow of their household fires ever kindled for a seaman a red spark upon the blind night of the group: and the calms of the coast, the flaming long calms of the equator, the unbreathing, concentrated calms like the deep introspection of a passionate nature, brooded awfully for days and weeks together over the unchangeable inheritance of their children; till at last the stones, hot like live embers, scorched the naked sole, till the water clung warm, and sickly, and as if thickened, about the legs of lean men with girded loins, wading thigh-deep in the pale blaze of the shallows. And it would happen now and then that the Sofala, through some delay in one of <b>the</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> would heave in sight making for Pangu bay as late as noonday.|$|E
