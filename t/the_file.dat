5|$|In 1952, Chotiner {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Knowland. Knowland cross-filed and won both major party primaries, virtually assuring his re-election. The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the California 22nd Congressional district Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> {{which was supposed to}} be for Congressional use only, though he apparently made no public use of <b>the</b> <b>file</b> in the campaign. Holt defeated Tenney in the primary, and {{went on to win the}} general election.|$|E
5|$|Investigating further, Mulder and Scully {{learn that}} Fiore, Barbala, Felder and Morris had all worked closely {{together}} in the past. They also find that Fiore's wife Anita keeps a collection of origami animals made by her first husband—Charlie Morris. Anita tells the agents that Fiore hasn't returned home from the previous night; meanwhile, the agents find that pages are missing from <b>the</b> <b>file</b> on Morris' murder, and Fiore {{was the last one}} to have checked <b>the</b> <b>file</b> out.|$|E

40|$|Medical {{doctors and}} {{researchers}} {{have to send}} medical image files to each other. This may be for a consult, because a patient is treated by a different doctor or because <b>the</b> <b>files</b> are {{to be used for}} research. <b>The</b> <b>files</b> contain personal health information, and privacy rules have to be satisfied before <b>the</b> <b>files</b> may be sent. To securely send <b>the</b> <b>files</b> <b>the</b> data should be encrypted and anonymized. The problem {{led to the development of}} DICOMmunicator, a single page web application. It allows clinicians to use the self-descriptive application to send DICOM files to another doctor. DICOMmunicator removes patient information from <b>the</b> <b>files</b> that are uploaded, encrypts <b>the</b> <b>files</b> and stores them in a database.

5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing <b>the</b> <b>file</b> to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 also {{introduced}} free-format code. Free-format code {{can be placed}} in any column of <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> as in newer programming languages.

5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{uses the}} SCUMM engine {{developed}} for Maniac Mansion. LucasArts had gradually modified the engine since its creation. For example, {{the number of}} input verbs was reduced and items in the character's inventory are represented by icons rather than text. While implementing an animation, the designers encountered a problem later discovered to be limitation of the engine. Upon learning of the limitation, Gilbert reminisced about <b>the</b> <b>file</b> size of the first game. The staff then resolved to include it in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|In Plan 9, {{virtually}} all computing resources, including files, network connections, and peripheral devices, are represented through <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system rather than specialized interfaces.

5|$|Susanne admits her {{deception}} but {{claims that}} she was scapegoated for trying to leave {{her job at the}} weapons facility.

After deciphering <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> the Lone Gunmen find {{that she was}} telling the truth, learning the location of the gas. Susanne also finds evidence that she had a tracking device put in a tooth, which she pulls out.|$|E
50|$|The fate of <b>the</b> <b>files</b> {{was finally}} decided under the Unification Treaty between the GDR and Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). This treaty took the Volkskammer law further and allowed more {{access and use}} of <b>the</b> <b>files.</b> Along with <b>the</b> {{decision}} to keep <b>the</b> <b>files</b> in a central location in the East, they also decided who could see and use <b>the</b> <b>files,</b> allowing people to see their own files.|$|R
50|$|All check-ins in StarTeam are atomic. Whenever {{more than}} one file is checked in {{as the result of}} a single {{transaction}} all of <b>the</b> <b>files,</b> and their associated process items, are updated in a single action. If for some reason, the check-in fails, none of <b>the</b> <b>files</b> are checked in, and the status of the associated process items is not updated. For example, suppose User A selects to check in all modified files in a StarTeam folder, but one of <b>the</b> selected <b>files</b> is locked by User B. Because of <b>the</b> locked <b>file,</b> none of <b>the</b> <b>files</b> are checked in (and none of the process items are updated as fixed) and User A is notified that none of <b>the</b> <b>files</b> were checked in because one of <b>the</b> <b>files</b> was locked by User B.|$|R

5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), <b>the</b> <b>file</b> will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|E
5|$|The data {{division}} is split into six sections which declare different items: <b>the</b> <b>file</b> section, for file records; the working-storage section, for static variables; the local-storage section, for automatic variables; the linkage section, for parameters {{and the return}} value; the report section and the screen section, for text-based user interfaces.|$|E
5|$|The first idea means that, unlike on most {{operating}} systems, processes (running programs) {{each have}} their own view of the namespace, corresponding to what other operating systems call <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system; a single path name may refer to different resources for different processes.

5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including metadata and file data. Metadata and file data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. <b>The</b> <b>file</b> size, number of files in a folder, total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, some {{manufacturers}} (notably Samsung) introduced SSD controllers that extended {{the concept of}} BGC to analyze <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted files and unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this would ensure that even systems (operating systems and SATA controller hardware) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system. It is not clear if this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives {{if they are not}} formatted properly using MBR and NTFS.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. He noted when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though <b>the</b> <b>file</b> strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer Batten, who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E
