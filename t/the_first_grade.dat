5|$|Under his uncle's guidance, O'Neill {{joined the}} St George Cricket Club, in the Sydney Grade competition. He {{steadily}} moved {{up through the}} grades and broke into <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>grade</b> side {{at the age of}} 16. Sensing his potential, the club's selectors informed him that regardless of form, he would play the full season, which allowed him to be uninhibited in his batting. He made 108 in seven innings. The next season, he was out 12 times leg before wicket in 15 innings, and run out in the other three. O'Neill attributed his failures to over-aggressiveness and resolved to improve his patience. In the second match of the new season, the 17-year-old O'Neill made his first century. With all five state selectors onlooking, he made 28 in the next match and was called into the state squad.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sequence}} {{is a consequence}} of the definition of convergence of a spectral sequence. The second page differential with codomain E21,0 originates from E2&minus;1,1, which is zero by assumption. The differential with domain E21,0 has codomain E23,&minus;1, which is also zero by assumption. Similarly, the incoming and outgoing differentials of Er1,0 are zero for all [...] Therefore the (1,0) term of the spectral sequence has converged, meaning that it is isomorphic to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>graded</b> piece of <b>the</b> abutment H 1(A). Because the spectral sequence lies in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> quadrant, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>graded</b> piece is equal to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> subgroup in <b>the</b> filtration defining the graded pieces. The inclusion of this subgroup yields the injection E21,0 &rarr; H 1(A) which begins the five-term exact sequence. This injection is called an edge map.|$|R

40|$|The idea {{to make a}} {{research}} {{on the use of}} the textbook of Geography in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>grades</b> of theelementary school emerged from several discussions during the Course of Geography at the FaculdadeCatólica de Uberlândia-MG. The subject is controversial and there are divergences in what relatesto its importance and use by teachers. We then chose an edition for analysis which is used inseveral state public schools in Uberlândia-MG. We tried to identify and analyze the way somegeographical concepts – that are in our opinion fundamental for the understanding of thegeographical space – are approached in the textbooks. To understand the pedagogic proposal ofsome textbooks of Geography for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>grades</b> of <b>the</b> elementary school it is necessary to evaluate the methodological referential used by the author - or authors - and the criteria that motivate itschoice by teachers and schools. We compared the books content that is suggested by the Secretariade Estado da Educação de Minas Gerais (Education Secretary of the State) to the book content ofthe chosen edition. The objective is not to demerit the work, but to point out ways and someimportant criteria for the choice of textbooks for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>grades</b> of <b>the</b> elementary school. Thisinstrument should not foment discrimination, impartiality or neutrality. It should offer elements sothat teachers and students exercise their potential and creativity on the proposed themes, as a toolto be efficiently used in classrooms...|$|R

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{precursors}} of spelling difficulties in <b>first</b> <b>grade</b> for children with specific language impairment (SLI). A sample of 58 second-year kindergartners in the Netherlands was followed until <b>the</b> end of <b>first</b> <b>grade.</b> Linguistic, phonological, orthographic, letter knowledge, memory, and nonverbal-reasoning skills were considered as precursors, as was spelling level at an earlier point in time. Spelling difficulties at <b>the</b> end of <b>first</b> <b>grade</b> were most accurately identified by letter knowledge at <b>the</b> beginning of <b>first</b> <b>grade</b> and word spelling at <b>the</b> middle of <b>first</b> <b>grade.</b> It is concluded that spelling development in children with SLI {{can be seen as}} an autocatalytic process in which, without intervention, poor spellers generally remain poor spellers, and good spellers remain good spellers. A focus on early spelling intervention is thus emphasized...|$|R
