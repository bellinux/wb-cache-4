40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>shelter</b> {{for storing}} {{electronic}} and technical equipments has high indoor heat dissipation rate, and cooling load exists almost all year around. Energy consumption of cooling system takes majority of entire energy use. Our project aims {{in reducing the}} energy consumption by proper design of building envelop and optimal control of cooling system. Both experimental measurements and computer simulation are carried out to analyze the indoor climate and energy performance of <b>technical</b> <b>shelter</b> in different conditions. The experiments are made on a standard <b>technical</b> <b>shelter.</b> Vertical temperature gradient and air flow rate are measured by thermocouples and tracer gas technology. Energy balance is calculated by simplified analysis method based on measurement results. Simulation program BSim is applied in the study. The simulation results are compared with measurement results. Finally, PV system is planned {{to build on the}} roof to power <b>technical</b> <b>shelter.</b> Both off-grid and on-grid PV systems are designed based on PVSYST software...|$|E
50|$|Washington's Housing Trust Fund was {{established}} in 1987 by RCW 43.185.030. RCW 43.185.050 authorizes the Trust to fund proposals for new construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation as well as rent or mortgage subsidies, down payment or closing cost assistance for first-time home buyers, or mortgage insurance matching funds, social services for housing residents with special needs, <b>technical</b> assistance, <b>shelters</b> for homeless individuals, and projects making housing more accessible for households with disabilities. More detailed priorities for funding are developed by the Department of Commerce {{with the assistance of}} the Affordable Housing Advisory Board, consisting of 22 members primarily appointed by the Governor. Funding targets households earning below 80% of the county's median income and households with special needs, such as physical disabilities or developmental disabilities, and households served by the Departments of Health and Social and Health Services.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by AREP and MaP3 {{during a}} {{competition}} in 2007, {{the station is}} built on Land reclamation by the sea. The project is inspired by marina's landscape (seagulls, boat masts, cables). The structure shape is obtained by moving and rotating identical frames: [...] "arches" [...] and roof beams, connected together by braced brackets and cables diagonals. Arches and beams are welded on a central beam, with a triangular box section, <b>sheltering</b> <b>technical</b> catwalk. The whole structure is fabricated with folded steel sheets. The roofing is made by aluminium plates interrupted by polycarbonate strips. The ceiling is made of aluminium blades.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} photovoltaic-hydrogen {{power system}} for mobile phone station. This {{base transceiver station}} (BTS) is located in neighboring Ouargla city (in the south of Algeria). The power system includes a photovoltaic (PV) field, water electrolyzer and two fuel cells. Each fuel cell is used according to daily and seasonal load of the station. A biphasic model is adopted for the simulation of fuel cell stacks. The governing equations are solved using a program written under Matlab. Multi-criteria optimization with weighting between two opposite objectives is {{used to determine the}} compromise solutions between maximum efficiency and minimal fuel cells size. Genetic algorithm coupled with Quasi-Newton method is used to achieve optimal fuel cells operations. The optimal solutions in Pareto sense are plotted according to weighting coefficient. The obtained results show that PV modules number for the summer period is relatively high which requires introducing some <b>technical</b> improvements on <b>shelter</b> walls for reducing air-conditioning loads...|$|R
