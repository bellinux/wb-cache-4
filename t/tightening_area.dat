40|$|This report {{contains}} a degree project {{made by the}} mechanical engineering students Lennart Andersson and Daniel Jansson. The project has performed in assignment by SOMAS Valves AB in Säffle. SOMAS are leading in development on control and on/off valves. To maintain this position they always want to improve their products. One way in this development is valves that are more tightened. The purpose with our project was to investigate another seat design on a HiCo (High Cobalt Alloy) seat to a SKV 150 PN 25 valve and compare this to an original HiCo seat. By modifying the seat on a ball valve we want to achieve a valve that leaks lesser then a valve whit original seat. At {{the same time the}} maneuver torque should be retained or better and the wear should not be worse. The project begins with a theoretic investigation of valve forces, maneuver torque and seat design. A manufacturing drawing was made in Pro ENGINEER and handed over to SOMAS AB for manufacturing. Four seats are made in the new design and will be compared with four original seats about maneuver torque, tightened and wear. The idea to make a trace {{in the middle of the}} seat was that it would tighten earlier. Water under pressure is pressed against the valve to test its resistance of leaking, the leaking is measured by a measure glass. The modified seats leaks more then the original seats, even though, according to the theory they should have a higher seat force. Even the maneuver torque is higher on the modified seats, but this increase is not a problem. All seats was tested to watch their resistant to wear, to test this, a valve mounted with seats is opened and closed 600 times (about 3 hours). Because of the short wear time it’s hard to see and validated wear, but on the after coming pressure test the valve is more tightened. A reason to leaking is the tolerances between the seats and the ball. The reason why the modified valve seat leaks more is probably that the lathe area functions as a channel for the medium. The medium which passes the first <b>tightened</b> <b>area</b> can easier find a new way to pass the second <b>tightened</b> <b>area.</b> The conclusion is that the new seat design is nothing to go further with, but there are proposals for a new seat design...|$|R

This paper describes our experiments on "Non-Linear Visual Space Transformations" (NLVST). NLVST encompasses several innovative techniques: (1) employing a histogram for calculating the density of data distribution; (2) mapping the raw data values to a non-linear scale for stretching a high-density area; (3) <b>tightening</b> the sparse <b>area</b> to save the display space; (4) employing different color ranges of values on a non-linear scale according to the local density.

The government of sub-province Bulungan prepares various programs to welcome realized by it the vision and mission. One of them is assist and accommodates the investors which will inculcate its capital is especially in coalmine area. With realization of opening of coal-mine in sub-province Bulungan that is in district Bunyu, expected can give contribution to sub-province public Bulungan generally and district public of Bunyu especially. Descriptive method as trouble-shooting procedure investigated by depicting or describes situation of research subject (someone, institute, public and others) at present moment based on facts {{which seems to be}} or as it is. Relates to research title selected by writer that is Government Science Majors, Government Policy Impact Sub-Province Bulungan for Permit from Effort for Coal Mining to PT Lamindo Inter Multikom. Which included in social symptoms and politics which all its haves the character of descriptive. Therefore, that in this research writer applies descriptive research type. Purpose of research which wish to be reached in this research is to know policy impact of government of sub-province Bulungan to permit from effort for mining (IUP) coal to PT Lamindo Inter Multikom No 97 /K-III/ 540 / 2008 in district Bunyu. The impact seen from four areas is social area, economics area, political area and environmental area in district Bunyu. Result from this research, simply policy of government of sub-province Bulungan to permit from effort for coal mining to PT Lamindo Inter Multikom there is problem in one area is environmental area. During operating it this coalmine simply has contaminated source of water residing in orchard Sungai Kapur, so source of water applied for everyday in the orchard improper do applied because rust colored and smells. Although in the field of social, economics, political generates impact that are positive, but negative impact of this environmental area can influence continuity of public life in orchard Sungai Kapur especially and district public of Bunyu in general. From this research can do taken a conclusion that this policy has not so matured for implementation. When run of opening of coalmine started in May the year 2009 has generated impact in environmental area is impure of source of water in orchard Sungai Kapur. This thing influences life of public in orchard Sungai Kapur because source of the wellspring only distance 1. 5 km from chalk river orchard, besides source of the wellspring do applied to fulfill requirement of everyday Sungai Kapur orchard public. Impure of source of his the sure wellspring influencing activity of public in the orchard either present moment and also forwards later, when there is no response from government of sub-province Bulungan and PT Lamindo Inter Multikom as party is holding responsible. With impact which has arisen from opening of coal-mine in district Bunyu, thinks it government of sub-province and PT Lamindo Inter Multikom soon looks for solution to affect the can be overcome. Possibly, with looking for source of new water again which far from location of coal-mine but close to settlement of orchard SUNGAI KAPUR or looks for equipment which can dissociate matter which can contaminate source of water in Sungai Kapur orchard...|$|R

This procedure aims to create a controlled scarring and stricturing of the anal canal. In theory, {{it is thought that}} radiofrequency induced IAS injury may cause collagen deposition and fibrosis (scarring), resulting in the affected <b>area</b> <b>tightening.</b> Specialized surgical instrument called a radiofrequency handpiece is used. It has 4 needles which enter the IAS and heat up to 85 °C. This causes the water molecules in the tissue to vibrate with subsequent frictional heating. The hand piece is cooled by water and monitors the temperature of the tissues it is applied to for safety. It is thought that the improvement in FI occurs over time as collagen is deposited and the tissues undergo remodeling. The procedure is carried out under local anesthesia (with or without conscious sedation) on an outpatient basis. There appear to be relatively few serious complications.Initial studies of the SECCA procedure have shown promising improvements in quality of life and FI severity scores, however large randomized control trials and systematic reviews are currently lacking.|$|R

40|$|Frequent and {{extremely}} damaging severe weather {{conditions in the}} United States during 1991 – 94 caused $ 40 billion in insured losses, creating major impacts and eliciting diverse responses in the weather insurance industry. Population, {{one reason for the}} growing national sensitivity to storm damage, explained much of {{the increase in the number}} of catastrophes (property losses> $ 10 million) as well as the increases in the amount of losses. The largest increases in storms occurred in areas experiencing the greatest population growth (west, southwest, south, and southeast). Shifts in atmospheric variables (particularly in the frequency of extratropical cyclones) explained most of the 1949 – 94 fluctuations found in the intensity of catastrophic storms (losses divided by storm frequency). The property-casualty sector raised rates, made major changes in insurance availability in high-risk <b>areas,</b> <b>tightened</b> underwriting restrictions in hurricane-prone areas, and is making extensive assessments of weather risks. The reinsurance industry raised rates up to 200 %, sought and received funds from the financial markets, and developed new firms. However, some existing firms also withdrew from the marketplace. Crop losses led to major changes in the nation’s crop insurance program. The property casualty and reinsurance sectors, which experienced the greatest losses, have gained a greater appreciation of the need to incorporate atmospheric data, information, and expertise into their operations.

The relevance of this work is due to important national issue for China. Traditionally, China has evolved as a multinational state, which was caused solely as a factor of external influence, for example, the Mongol and Manchu invasion and implementation of foreign policy objectives aimed at expanding the boundaries, resulting in a connection of Xinjiang and Tibet. A key feature of China as a multiethnic state {{has always been a}} numerical predominance of one ethnic group - the Han, as a rule, makes up almost all periods of the history of China, about 90 % of the population. At the same time, China has always been inhabited by many ethnic minorities, which are not only occasionally something borrowed from Han people, but also constantly subjected Sinification. Sinification it was and remains one of the leading destinations for small nations. With the formation of the PRC in 1949, before the new communist government faced the problem of alignment of the national policy with regard to national minorities. The national policy of the Communist Party of China in its development has passed through three stages. In this article is considered the second period of this policy since the late 1950 ‟s. When starting to implement policies "Great Leap Forward" and the end of 1970 ‟s., {{as a result of the}} reforms of Deng Xiaoping began to change and the situation of small nations.
