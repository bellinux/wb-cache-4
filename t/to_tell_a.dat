5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Deangelo {{makes it}} back to the office, still in his {{hospital}} gown, with an IV tube trailing from his arm. His attempts <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> bar joke come out as random gibberish. Gabe and Jim lead him out of the office after Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) calls for an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|In Brooklyn {{during the}} 1980s, a heavyset, middle-aged woman walks alone meets a mysterious man who greets her and shows her {{the remains of}} a black leather jacket. The woman sobs at the sight of it, and the man begins <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story.|$|E
5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.|$|E

5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} how <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions {{the recommendations of}} other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends {{with a description of}} how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E

5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E
5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea {{was of a}} writer with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because it allowed him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> broader story. He was also {{trying to create a}} layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right frame of mind.|$|E

25|$|As with König's paradox, {{this paradox}} cannot be formalized in axiomatic set theory because it {{requires}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>a</b> description applies to a particular set (or, equivalently, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>a</b> formula is actually {{the definition of a}} single set).|$|R
5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} watch them in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> large piece of the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E
5|$|The Lives formed {{part of the}} Cabinet of Biography in the Cabinet Cyclopaedia. Within the set of ten, the three-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal (1835–37) and the two-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France (1838–39) {{consist of}} biographies of {{important}} writers and thinkers of the 14th to 18th centuries. Most of them were written by the Romantic writer Mary Shelley. Shelley's biographies reveal her as a professional woman of letters, contracted to produce several volumes of works and paid well to do so. Her extensive knowledge of history and languages, her ability <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the burgeoning field of feminist historiography are reflected in these works.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, who sought <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> comedic story based on horror film and B-movie clichés. They mapped out {{the project as}} a paper-and-pencil game before coding commenced. While earlier adventure titles had relied on command lines, Gilbert disliked such systems, and he developed Maniac Mansions simpler point-and-click interface as a replacement. To speed up production, he created a game engine called SCUMM, which was used in many later LucasArts titles. After its release, Maniac Mansion was ported to several platforms. A port for the Nintendo Entertainment System had to be reworked heavily, in response to complaints by Nintendo of America that the game was inappropriate for children.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode parodies the {{title of the}} 1988 cult film, Hell Comes to Frogtown. In the opening scene of the episode, Peter, Joe, Quagmire and Cleveland are shown playing ping pong at the local bar. Once Joe accidentally hits their final ping pong ball out a window, Peter {{responds}} by forcing the puppet character Mr. Moose, from the children's television series Captain Kangaroo, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> knock-knock joke. This causes hundreds of ping pong balls to cascade from the ceiling above them. Going on to exclaim the amount of fun he is having, Peter recounts his performance in a Broadway musical version of the 1984 film Red Dawn.|$|E
