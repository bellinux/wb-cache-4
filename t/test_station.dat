5|$|Male progeny go to {{a station}} in Pépieux {{in the south}} of France, where they are fed a ration of corn silage before being {{slaughtered}} at the age of 16 months. In addition to evaluations of growth and conformation in the live animals, carcases, including fat composition, are evaluated. The best bulls identified in progeny testing are formally given the award Young Beef Cattle (in French Viande Jeunes Bovins, abbreviated to JB). Female progeny go to a <b>test</b> <b>station</b> in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The <b>test</b> <b>station</b> evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E

These include: If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.|$|E

5|$|The best bulls go to {{artificial}} insemination (AI) cooperatives where semen is taken. AI allows the wide distribution of a bulls' genetics {{to the benefit}} of more farmers. However, in order to guarantee their genetic qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict selection scheme to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another <b>test</b> <b>station</b> at Naves in Corrèze. Here they are tested more accurately and evaluated for feed conversion efficiency, growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best natural service bulls, are then evaluated. Cows are inseminated to produce 60 to 80 calves per bull tested, which are in turn evaluated.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance <b>Test</b> <b>Station</b> at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse pulling and {{slipping}} parameters of tractors on the base of performed pulling tests and to develop general mathematic formulas suitable for the evaluation of pulling properties of tractors of different types in a roller <b>testing</b> <b>station.</b> For these measurements a JOHN DEERE 7820 tractor was used. Pulling characteristics of this tractor were measured in the roller <b>testing</b> <b>station,</b> which was equipped with a dynamometer VDU E 270 T-E 150 T. This paper presents results of such tests and enables to estimate with a good degree of accuracy and statistical significance final parameters of pulling properties of tractors. Final pulling parameters of tractors of different types can be estimated for arbitrary values of slippage. The derived relationships presented in this paper enable to evaluate pulling properties of tractors in a roller <b>testing</b> <b>station</b> with the same reliability as those defined for standard curves of slippage. The technical equipment of this roller <b>testing</b> <b>station</b> with four dynamometers enables to measure independently driving forces, slippage and speed of each wheel. In this <b>testing</b> <b>station</b> it is possible to evaluate pulling properties of tractors under changing load and to estimate pulling and slipping parameters of a concrete type of tractor...|$|R
