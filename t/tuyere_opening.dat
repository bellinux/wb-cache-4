40|$|AbstractCircumferential BF hearth shell {{stress was}} {{measured}} {{during the two}} blast furnaces blow-in periods. BF 1 had the hearth with not developed salamander. It was blew down after reline and few days of full tuyeres operation. BF 3 hearth had fully developed salamander after 12 years of operation. Before start up both BF hearths were identical cleaned up 1 m bellow the tap hole elevation. Blow in line on BF 1 also BF 3 salamander were circumferential trenched out up to the hearth bottom elevation down. Maximal measured BF 1 hearth shell tension level reached 100 MPa. 160 MPa was the detected maximal BF 3 hearth shell tension. Tension level 100 MPa was detected 6 days after start up on both furnaces, This level stayed identical on BF 1 {{for the next four}} days but on BF 3 tension rose during the next two days period up to level 160 MPa. Maximal pressure started relieve on both furnaces 8 days after start up. Hearth shell stress stabilized on both furnaces on range 30 – 50 MPa when hearth thermocouples readings started stabilize. Data shows significant contribution of hearth refractory to hearth shell stress creation. Melting rate, <b>tuyeres</b> <b>opening</b> strategy, casting schedule can contribute to BF hearth shell stress control during the blow in period...|$|R
