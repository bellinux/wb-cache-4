30|$|In {{addition}} to written comments, {{our system is}} able to allow the teacher to record his/her voice during the assessment such that the <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> provide oral comments.

The <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> underline some sentences and voice out how they can be revised to improve the flow.

25|$|<b>Teachers</b> <b>can,</b> however, accidentally promote {{cheating}} behavior. A {{study found}} {{a correlation between}} how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating {{as a way of}} getting back at the teacher. Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a grade curve, are more likely to cheat.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{publications}} have outlined clearly instructional strategies that <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> use to implement dialogue journal interaction effectively, both {{in writing and}} orally.

The teacher’s strategies may also be designed to have an impact on the students’ language use and learning.|$|E
25|$|Although neither {{introversion}} nor extraversion is pathological, psychotherapists {{can take}} temperament {{into account when}} treating clients. Clients may respond better to different types of treatment depending on where they fall on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. <b>Teachers</b> <b>can</b> also consider temperament when dealing with their pupils, for example acknowledging that introverted children need more encouragement to speak in class while extraverted children may grow restless during long periods of quiet study.|$|E
25|$|School-based mass {{deworming}} {{programs have}} been the most popular strategy {{to address the issue of}} hookworm infection in children. School-based programs are extremely cost-effective as schools already have an available, extensive, and sustained infrastructure with a skilled workforce that has a close relationship with the community.

25|$|One {{important}} aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly assume children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not {{given an opportunity to}} develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. <b>Teachers</b> <b>can</b> model social skills and ask questions in a less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.|$|E
25|$|Exploding Snap is a wizarding {{card game}} in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron are held back from {{investigating}} why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because Fred and George delayed them with this game. Ron later singed his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In Order of the Phoenix, Lee Jordan is punished by Dolores Umbridge for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, {{as one of her}} Educational Decrees states that <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> only talk to students about the subjects they are paid to teach. In Cursed Child Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of Chamber of Secrets and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{developed}} AMS for university with NFC on Nexus. In this system, the <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> form {{a relationship between}} teacher and student, because the <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> recognize the faces displayed on Nexus when the student touch the ID card to it.

25|$|Applied {{behavior}} analysis, a research-based science utilizing behavioral {{principles of}} operant conditioning, {{is effective in}} a range of educational settings. For example, <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> alter student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of self-determination theory, who claim that praise and other rewards undermine intrinsic motivation. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior. But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation. Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis, including pivotal response therapy which is used to treat autism spectrum disorders.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Katsuhisa Fujita, {{a retired}} teacher in Tokyo, was {{threatened}} with imprisonment and fined 200,000 yen (roughly 2,000 US dollars) {{after he was}} accused of disturbing a graduation ceremony at Itabashi High School by urging the attendees to remain seated during the playing of the anthem. At the time of Fujita's sentence, 345 teachers had been punished for refusing to take part in anthem related events, though Fujita is the only man to have been convicted in relation to it. On September 21, 2006, the Tokyo District Court ordered the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to pay compensation to the teachers who had been subjected to punishment under the directive of the Tokyo Board of Education. The then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi commented, [...] "It is a natural idea to treat the national anthem importantly". The ruling has been appealed by the Metropolitan Government. Since October 23, 2003, 410 teachers and school workers have been punished for refusing to stand and sing the anthem as ordered by school principals. <b>Teachers</b> <b>can</b> also be punished if their students do not stand while [...] "Kimigayo" [...] is played during school ceremonies.|$|E
