25|$|Castel Terracena (Terracena Castle), {{built by}} Robert Guiscard in 1076–1086 as a royal mansion, {{next to the}} Eastern walls. Only scarce remains (mainly tower-houses in tuff) can be seen <b>today,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{destroyed}} by an earthquake in 1275.|$|E
25|$|Revived in {{the early}} twentieth century along with other sizes of recorder, it is used <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the eighteenth century—as a {{substitute}} for the transverse flute—though it also has a small repertory of music composed specially for it, from both the Baroque and modern periods.|$|E

It was {{constructed}} in 1906 and remains much the same <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 1912. McAllister was a successful dry goods dealer whose longtime business in the Daniel Pierce Building evolved into the later Henderson's Department Store in downtown Sycamore.|$|E

25|$|For a {{long period}} of time there were two castles in Dellmensingen: the Untere Burg (Lower Castle), {{surrounded}} by a moat, mentioned in the 15th century, of which no remains are visible <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> completely demolished in 1809, and the Obere Burg (Upper Castle). Both castles were destroyed during the Thirty Years War.|$|E
25|$|The Tories were {{in power}} for almost 50 years, {{except for a}} Whig {{ministry}} from 1806 to 1807. Lord Liverpool was Prime Minister for 15 years; he and Pitt held the position for 34 years. Under their long, consistent leadership, Cabinet government became a convention of the constitution. Although subtle issues remained to be settled, the Cabinet system of government {{is essentially the same}} <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 1830.|$|E
25|$|An independent, {{critical}} {{voice on}} politics, literature, science, {{and the arts}} seems as much needed <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when Barbara Epstein and I put out {{the first edition of}} the New York Review fifty years ago – perhaps even more so. Electronic forms of communication grow rapidly in every field of life but many of their effects on culture remain obscure and in need of new kinds of critical scrutiny. That will be a central concern of the Review for the years to come.|$|E

25|$|Catholicism {{has been}} the {{predominant}} religion in France {{for more than a}} millennium, though it is not as actively practised <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic. While in the 1980s, more than 80% of the French still declared themselves to be Catholics, in the 1990s this proportion had fallen to less than 70%, in the 2000s to less than 60%, and in the 2010s it is less than 50%. According to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (Ifop) 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian as of that year; at the same time 39.6% of the population had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.|$|E
25|$|Lessuden village, as it {{was then}} known, {{consisted}} of one long street, now Main Street, and a narrow back-road which ran along Braeheads, on the high banks of the river. Several paths connected Braeheads to the main street. The form of the old village remains pretty much <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in times gone past. It probably was not much different in 1544 when the army of Henry VIII of England under the Earl of Hertford razed the Border Abbeys and caused destruction of dwellings in the village including Lessuden House, which was later rebuilt. Nearby this house stood the original village church called St Mary's which was established in the 12th century in the reign of David I. Through time the worshippers moved to a church erected at Benrig near St Boisil's Chapel which, with repeated repairs and reconstructions, stood until 1952 when it was finally demolished.|$|E
25|$|The Charismatic {{element of}} the Church is seen as being evident <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{in the early days}} of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic {{communities}} conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|Audleya large, {{flat area}} {{at the base of}} one of the larger valleys in the park. The main road into the park from the north drops quickly from the heights to Audley, where it crosses the Hacking River on a weir before {{climbing}} up {{the other side of the}} valley to continue further into the park. Audley was developed in the late 19th century as a picnic area for Sydneysiders on a day trip. A large, heritage listed timber boathouse from that time still exists on the western bank of the weir and currently rents rowing boats and canoes to allow leisurely exploration of the upper reaches of the river. It also rents mountain bikes. A timber dance hall built in the early 20th century on the eastern bank is available for functions. Large picnic areas, grassy meadows and a café, rest rooms and a colony of hungry ducks complete the picnic picture. Audley is as popular with families <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the 19th century. After a heavy rain the weir floods, closing the road and forcing the residents of Bundeena to drive an extra 30 kilometres to the southern end of the park if they wish to drive to Sydney.|$|E

500|$|Trimmer's {{most popular}} book, Fabulous Histories, was reprinted {{for at least}} 133 years and had a {{profound}} impact on generations of readers and writers. In 1877, when the firm of Griffith and Farran published it as part of their [...] "Original Juvenile Library," [...] they advertised it as [...] "the delicious story of Dicksy, Flapsy, and Pecksy, who can have forgotten it? It is as fresh <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> half a century ago." [...] Tess Cosslett has also suggested that the names of Trimmer's birds — Dicksy, Pecksy, Flapsy and Robin—bear a striking resemblance to the rabbits — Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter — in Beatrix Potter's children's books.|$|E

50|$|Ichthyornis {{has been}} {{historically}} important in shedding light on bird evolution. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{the first known}} prehistoric bird relative preserved with teeth, and Charles Darwin noted its significance {{during the early years}} of the theory of evolution. Ichthyornis remains important <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> one of the few Mesozoic era ornithurans known from more than a few specimens.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of broad-leaf herbicides, white clover was more often added to lawn seed mixes than <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> able to grow and provide green cover in poorer soils where turfgrasses do not perform well. Many people consider clover a weed when growing in lawns, {{in part because the}} flowers are attractive to bees and thus could create a danger for people with bare feet.|$|R
500|$|The Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) {{ushered in}} a new era of taxonomy. With his major works Systema Naturae 1st Edition in 1735, Species Plantarum in 1753, and Systema Naturae 10th Edition, he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species, which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, andspecies, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower. Thus the Linnaean system was born, and is still used in essentially the same way <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the 18th century. Currently, plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus' work as the [...] "starting point" [...] for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively). Names published before these dates are referred to as [...] "pre-Linnaean", and not considered valid (with the exception of spiders published in Svenska Spindlar). Even taxonomic names published by Linnaeus himself before these dates are considered pre-Linnaean.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office {{would be a good}} thing.... We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

2500|$|Grade {{inflation}} {{has become an}} issue in Indian secondary education. In CBSE, a 95 per cent aggregate is 21 times as prevalent <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2004, and a 90 per cent close to nine times as prevalent. In the ISC Board, a 95 per cent is almost twice as prevalent <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2012. [...] CBSE called a meeting of all 40 school boards early in 2017 to urge them to discontinue “artifical spiking of marks”. CBSE decided to lead by example and promised not to inflate its results. But although the 2017 results have seen a small correction, the board has clearly not discarded the practice completely. Almost 6.5 per cent of mathematics examinees in 2017 scored 95 or more — 10 times higher than in 2004 — and almost 6 per cent of physics examinees scored 95 or more, 35 times more than in 2004.|$|E
