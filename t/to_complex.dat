Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.

The rooms outside the sanctuary grew larger and more elaborate over time, so that temples evolved from small shrines in the late Predynastic Period (late fourth millenniumBC) to large stone edifices in the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070BC) and later. These edifices are among the largest and most enduring examples of Egyptian architecture, with their elements arranged and decorated according <b>to</b> <b>complex</b> patterns of religious symbolism.

40|$|A {{basic problem}} in the {{classification}} theory of compact <b>complex</b> manifolds is <b>to</b> give simple characterizations of complex tori.

The question whether a compact complex manifold X diffeomorphic <b>to</b> a <b>complex</b> torus is biholomorphic <b>to</b> a <b>complex</b> torus has a negative answer due to a construction by Blanchard and Sommese.
