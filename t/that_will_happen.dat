500|$|The {{splitting}} of {{the moon}} (...) was a claimed miracle attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

500|$|Mullan {{remarked that}} Eugenides' narrator has a proclivity to reveal events <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> in the future.

He chooses instead to relate the story {{beginning}} with his future knowledge. Cal's genes reflect an anticipation of the future: the disclosure of his actual sex identity. Cal mimics this [...] "genetic inevitability" [...] by enjoining the readers to know the future prior to its occurring. Mullan observed that [...] "or the reader, apprehension predominates over surprise" [...] {{as a result of}} this narrative style.|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{believes}} that there's now {{a chance to}} change a political environment he thinks is filled with far too much vitriol. He hoped that the tragedy would also be an opportunity to improve the tone of our national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric. In {{response to a question}} on February 4, regarding the discussions about civility in politics Kelly said: [...] "I haven’t {{spent a lot of time}} following that, but I think that with something that was so horrible and so negative, and the fact that six people lost their lives including a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, Gabby’s staff member Gabe—who was like a younger brother to her—it’s really really a sad situation.

Switching cars with Mulder and Scully, Doggett and Reyes drive off. Black helicopters destroy the cliff dwellings—and The Smoking Man within—thinking that Mulder is still inside before flying away.

[...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E
