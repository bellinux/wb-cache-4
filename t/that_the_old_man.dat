5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E
5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of}} his life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in the metropolis, {{we learn}} that Mike, having married Phyllis on the {{assumption}} that his job as estate manager for Psmith's father would be secure, found on Mr Smith's death <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> was bankrupt, and is working as a poorly paid schoolmaster. Psmith worked for a time for an uncle in the fish business, but could stand the fish no longer and quit.|$|E
60|$|Weston {{shook his}} head resolutely, though he felt the same temptation. It was in one sense curious <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> should defer to him.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} priests among them, one an <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> and <b>the</b> other a young man; {{and that which}} was strangest was, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>man</b> was <b>the</b> worst.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} himself, Sir Charles began {{once more to}} relax in his {{severity}} towards this handsome young scapegrace. His absolute frankness disarmed criticism. It was in a more gracious voice <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> continued <b>the</b> conversation.|$|R
500|$|Tito {{is part of}} a Chinese Cuban {{family of}} {{freelance}} [...] "illegal facilitators", as Brown describes them – forgers, smugglers, and associated support personnel based in New York City – and is assigned by his uncles to hand over a series of iPods to a mysterious old man. Tito is adept in a form of systema that encompasses tradecraft, a variant of free running, and the Santería religion. It is alluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> may have connections to American intelligence circles and Tito hopes he can explain the mysterious death of his father. When the old man calls in a favour, his family dispatches Tito on a dangerous new assignment.|$|E
500|$|Vanger is {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family [...] "dysfunctional", Plummer {{said of the}} character: [...] "I love {{the character of the}} old man, and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power. So in dealing with people, he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, and know how to seduce them." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{surviving}} portrait {{from this}} time shows the prince in armour, mounted on a white horse and pulling the winged figure of Father Time by the forelock. Art historian John Sheeran suggests this is a classical allusion that signifies opportunity. The old man carries Henry's lance and plumed helmet; and scholar Chris Caple points out that his pose {{is similar to that}} of Albrecht Dürer's figure of death in Knight, Death and the Devil (1513).• [...] He also observes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> was painted later than other components of the painting, since the bricks of the wall show through his wings. When the painting was restored in 1985, the wall and the figure of time were revealed to modern eyes for the first time, having been painted over at some point in the seventeenth century by other hands than Peake's. The painting has also been cut down, the only original canvas edge being that on the left.• ...|$|E
60|$|But no pestilence came. And {{in every}} {{direction}} {{the young men and}} maidens were recklessly rushing into wedlock; and so salubrious <b>the</b> climate, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> stuck to <b>the</b> outside of the turf, and refused to go under.|$|R
60|$|Then Graham {{appeared}} and claimed him, {{and it was}} next morning when he saw Alfreton again. He was breakfasting with Colonel Barrington and Dane, and Winston noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> {{did not appear to}} have much appetite. When the meal was finished he drew him aside.|$|R
5000|$|... Clan Head & Presiding Judge, Tarakiri Clan CourtYomukodewaschosenby {{virtue of}} being <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>man</b> in <b>the</b> clan. The clan had no overall leader, no priest being overtly handpicked by Agadagba.

500|$|In chapter 13 of Völsunga saga, {{the hero}} Sigurðr {{is on his}} way to a wood and he meets a long-bearded old man he had never seen before. Sigurd tells the old man that he is going to choose a horse, and asks the old man to come with him to help him decide. The old man says that they should drive the horses down to the river Busiltjörn. The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltjörn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and {{handsome}} grey horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old man says that the horse is from [...] "Sleipnir's kin" [...] and that [...] "he must be raised carefully, because he will become better than any other horse." [...] The old man vanishes. Sigurd names the horse Grani, and the narrative adds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> was none other than (the god) Odin.|$|E
500|$|For the Iron Clad Lover: [...] "Dick makes love to Bessie while Tom plays a game {{of chess}} with her father. Tom, {{naturally}} nervous, plays such a poor game {{that he and the}} old man quarrel and Tom is ordered from the house. Next day is Bessie's birthday. Tom brings a bouquet and a box of candy. But he is turned away from the house and has the gifts thrown at his head by Bessie's father. Dick arrives and is welcomed. Tom, in desperation, buys a suit of armor, puts it on and has himself delivered to the house as a present to Bessie. Dick finds out that Tom is inside the armor and makes life miserable for him, blowing cigar smoke through the visor and making love to Bessie. Tom, unable to stand this, tries to announce himself, but only succeeds in stumbling over and breaking a valuable vase. Bessie's pa has the 'armor' thrown out. Dick's conscience makes him tell Bessie that Tom was in the armor and they started the rescue. They were horrified to learn <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> has sold the armor to a junk dealer; and Dick and Bessie have an exciting chase before the junk man is rounded up, when it takes combined efforts of a policeman, locksmith, and plumber to release Tom from his iron suit." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of Saruman’s other {{appearances}} in the book emerged {{in the process of}} writing. Christopher Tolkien believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> seen by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli at the edge of Fangorn forest near the beginning of The Two Towers is in the original drafts intended to be Gandalf. In the finished version he is Saruman. Similarly, in the first drafts of the chapter The Scouring of the Shire, Sharkey is successively a ruffian met by the hobbits and then that man’s unseen boss. It is only in the second draft of the chapter that, as Christopher Tolkien puts it, his father “perceive” that Sharkey was in fact Saruman. The name used by Saruman's henchmen for their diminished leader [...] is said in a footnote to the final text to be derived from an Orkish term meaning [...] "old man". Saruman's death scene, in which his body shrivels away to skin and bones revealing [...] "long years of death" [...] and [...] "a pale shrouded figure" [...] rises over the corpse, was not added until the page proofs of the completed book were being reviewed by Tolkien. John D. Rateliff and Jared Lobdell are among those to write that the scene shows similarities to the death of the 2000-year-old sorceress Ayesha in H. Rider Haggard's 1887 novel [...]|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{they set out}} upon the short journey to Tarzan's cabin. Four Waziri bore {{the body of the}} dead Englishman.

5000|$|A {{middle-aged man}} {{is taking a}} drink of beer. A young man (Matsuda) appears from under the floor, and it is {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> Mitake, is a former teacher of Kagenuma's father. Kagenuma is being haunted by {{the soul of a}} daughter whom his wife had aborted without his knowledge. Mitake refuses to help him.|$|R
60|$|Orders were {{accordingly}} issued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men,</b> <b>the</b> women, {{and children}} should at once leave the town; and, under guard of one battalion of troops, {{take refuge in}} an almost impregnable hill fort some miles away. One battalion was placed in garrison in the castle. The other three, with the irregulars, took post in the town, whence they could, if necessary, retreat into the castle.|$|R
2500|$|Report of a sad case {{recently}} {{tried before}} the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley. Lord Mayor asks whether either side {{is known to}} the police: Policeman X— Huxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones. People did say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> never got over it, and Owen worritted him to death; but I don't think {{it was so bad}} as that. Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don't {{think it will be a}} harmonic meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street. (Tom Huxley's 'low set' included Hooker 'in the green and vegetable line' and 'Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier'; Owen's 'crib in Bloomsbury' was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. Jermyn Street is known for its shops of men's clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a dandy.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A Mandarin {{announces the}} law of the land (Aria – Popolo di Pechino! – [...] "People of Peking!"). The Prince of Persia has failed to answer the three riddles, and he is to be {{beheaded}} at the next moonrising. As the crowd surges towards the gates of the palace, the imperial guards brutally repulse them, causing a blind old man to be knocked to the ground. The old man's slave-girl, Liù, cries out for help. A young man hears her cry and recognizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is his long-lost father, Timur, the deposed king of Tartary. The young Prince of Tartary is overjoyed at seeing Timur alive, but still urges Timur to not speak his name because he is afraid that the Chinese rulers, who have conquered Tartary, may kill or harm them. Timur then tells his son that, of all his servants, only Liù has remained faithful to him. When the Prince asks her why, she tells him that once, long ago in the palace, the Prince had smiled at her (Trio with chorus – The crowd, Liù, Prince of Tartary, Timur: Indietro, cani! – [...] "Back, dogs!").|$|E
2500|$|The book {{opens with}} former Ranger Captain Woodrow F. Call (now a bounty hunter) and Ned Brookshire, the [...] "salaried man" [...] of the title. [...] Brookshire {{has been sent}} to Texas from New York City by his boss, {{railroad}} tycoon Colonel Terry, to contract Call's services in apprehending a bandit. The bandit in question is a young Mexican named Joey Garza, who has cost Terry significant business and money through his deadly train robberies. Brookshire is surprised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> he encounters has such a reputation, though he notes that Call does have a rather dangerous and respect-demanding aura about him. Brookshire himself does not strike a particularly imposing figure, and soon proves not to be cut out for train or horse travel, inexperienced {{in the ways of}} the west or violence, and very homesick for his bossy but loving wife, Katie. Call, on the other hand, is the very picture of experience. Though he is old and seems almost to have trouble lifting his foot into the stirrups, his reputation speaks for him. He has spent forty years on the border and the frontier, many of those with his more talkative but equally respected late partner, Gus McCrae. Protecting settlers in innumerable skirmishes with hostile Indians, rustlers, and dangerous gangs has earned him {{a great deal of respect}} and a reputation that generally strikes fear into the hearts of criminals.|$|E

50|$|Wynn went {{on trial}} in mid-2010. He {{continued}} to profess his innocence. In addition to the missing body {{and the lack of}} any evidence suggesting Wykel was dead, Wynn argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police had not adequately explored the possibility they originally entertained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> might have suddenly decided to visit Argentina. The court declared a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.|$|R

2500|$|Scavenius {{boarded a}} train {{and headed for}} Berlin, where he arrived on Monday 24 November. The next crisis came when he was met by Renthe-Fink, who {{informed}} him that Ribbentrop had informed Fink {{that there had been}} a [...] "misunderstanding" [...] regarding the four clauses and that clause 2 would be deleted. This had specified that Denmark only had police-like obligations. Scavenius had a strict mandate not to change a sentence and stated that he would be unable to return to Copenhagen with a different content from the one agreed upon, but that he was willing to reopen negotiations to clarify the matter further. This reply enraged Ribbentrop (and rumours claim that he was considering ordering the SS to arrest Scavenius). The task fell to German diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker to patch up a compromise. He watered down the wording but left the content pretty intact. Nonetheless, for Scavenius it was a strong setback that the four clauses would now only get the status of a unilateral Danish declaration (...) with a comment on it by Fink that its content [...] "no doubt" [...] was in compliance with the pact. Furthermore, he was instructed to give a public speech while abstaining from mentioning the four clauses but only making general statements about Denmark's status as a neutral nation. Scavenius signed the pact. At the following reception, the Italian ambassador described Scavenius as [...] "a fish dragged on land ... a small old gentleman in a suit asking himself how on earth he got to this place". Lidegaard comments <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> remained defiant: during a conversation with Ribbentrop in which the latter complained about the [...] "barbarous cannibalism" [...] of Russian POWs, Scavenius rhetorically asked if that statement meant that Germany didn't feed her prisoners.|$|E

60|$|At {{the same}} instant the Mexican threw down his carbine and rushed for {{a window on the}} {{opposite}} side of the room. His ammunition was exhausted and with it had departed his courage. Flight seemed the only course remaining. Bridge made no effort to stop him.
