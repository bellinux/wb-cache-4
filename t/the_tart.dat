25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tart</b> {{was a free}} London-based satirical newspaper, {{and later}} an online webzine.|$|E
25|$|The paper's {{income was}} {{affected}} by the economic downturn, and midway through 2008, <b>The</b> <b>Tart</b> decided to focus on an online webzine. In summer 2008, it relaunched with a new website and editorial team.|$|E
25|$|A website was {{established}} in August 2007, and <b>The</b> <b>Tart</b> was distributed across ten university campuses during termtime in late 2007, including Oxford University, Cambridge University, Bristol University, Warwick University and London School of Economics.|$|E

25|$|In England, {{the celebration}} of the Night before Epiphany, Epiphany Eve, is known as Twelfth Night (The first night of Christmas is December 25–26, and Twelfth Night is January 5–6), and was a {{traditional}} time for mumming and the wassail. The yule log was left burning until this day, and the charcoal left was kept until the next Christmas to kindle next year's yule log, as well as to protect the house from fire and lightning. In the past, Epiphany was also a day for playing practical jokes, similar to April Fool's Day. Today in England, Twelfth Night is still as popular a day for plays as when Shakespeare's Twelfth Night was first performed in 1601, and annual celebrations involving the Holly Man are held in London. A traditional dish for Epiphany was Twelfth Cake, a rich, dense, typically English fruitcake. As in Europe, whoever found the baked-in bean was king for a day, but unique to English tradition other items were sometimes included in the cake. Whoever found the clove was the villain, the twig, the fool, and the rag, <b>the</b> <b>tart.</b> Anything spicy or hot, like ginger snaps and spiced ale, was considered proper Twelfth Night fare, recalling the costly spices brought by the Wise Men. Another English Epiphany dessert was the jam tart, but made into a six-point star for the occasion to symbolize the Star of Bethlehem, and thus called Epiphany tart. The discerning English cook sometimes tried to use thirteen different coloured jams on <b>the</b> <b>tart</b> on this day for luck, creating a dessert with the appearance of stained glass.|$|E
25|$|Since 1960, Coronation Street has {{featured}} many characters whose {{popularity with}} viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast {{was created by}} Tony Warren, with the characters of Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) as central figures. These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became archetypes of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice. Elsie was <b>the</b> <b>tart</b> with a heart, who was constantly hurt by men {{in the search for}} true love. Annie Walker, landlady of the Rovers Return Inn, had delusions of grandeur and saw herself as better than other residents of Coronation Street.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> English custard <b>tart</b> and <b>the</b> Portuguese pastel de nata are European {{forerunners}} of <b>the</b> Chinese egg <b>tart</b> which displays {{characteristics of}} both. Before egg tart {{was introduced to}} Hong Kong, it is reported that it was first found in 1920s Guangzhou. Taking reference from the recipes of fruit <b>tarts,</b> <b>the</b> chefs in Guangzhou turned it into egg tarts by filling egg custards in the middle instead, a similar way to make simmered eggs with milk (燉蛋). However, as butter was very costly at that time, {{it was difficult for}} the chefs to make puff pastry for <b>the</b> <b>tarts.</b> Therefore, they may have used lard instead.|$|R
500|$|In the Carpathian Mountains of {{southern}} Poland, variants of borscht are also made in which <b>the</b> <b>tart</b> taste comes from dairy products, such as whey or buttermilk. Although the deep red color of beetroot borscht may remind those unfamiliar with Polish cuisine of blood, {{the kind of}} borscht that does contain animal (usually poultry) blood mixed with vinegar is dark brownish-gray in color and aptly called [...] "gray borscht" [...] (...) , which is a regional name of the Polish blood soup better known as [...]|$|E
500|$|Unlike Chardonnay, most Riesling do not undergo malolactic fermentation. This helps {{preserve}} <b>the</b> <b>tart,</b> acidic {{characteristic of}} the wine that gives Riesling its [...] "thirst-quenching" [...] quality. (Producers of Sauvignon blanc and Pinot grigio often avoid malolactic fermentation for the same reason.) Riesling is often put {{through a process of}} cold stabilization, where the wine is stored just above its freezing point. The wine is kept at this temperature until much of the tartaric acid has crystallized and precipitated out of the wine. This helps prevent crystallization of the acid (often called [...] "wine diamonds") in the bottle. After this, the wine is normally filtered again to remove any remaining yeast or impurities.|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause <b>the</b> <b>tart</b> flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.|$|E

50|$|Recipes for <b>the</b> butter <b>tart</b> vary {{according}} to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of <b>the</b> butter <b>tart</b> - <b>the</b> firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling - also vary.|$|R
500|$|Perennially [...] "unlucky in love", Donna fits <b>the</b> <b>tart</b> {{with a heart}} stereotype. Her {{numerous}} romances {{during her}} tenure earned her the nickname [...] "Nurse 'Action' Jackson". In 2004, she had a lesbian liaison with Mickie. The scene in which they kissed was edited to half its original length after being deemed too explicit for pre-watershed broadcast. Later that year, Jacobs stated that her ideal storyline would be for Donna {{to find a good}} man and gain a promotion, hoping she would find someone who would treat her well and help her give up her recreational drug habit. Her love interests included physiotherapist Justin Fuller, registrars Ed Keating (Rocky Marshall) and Mubbs Hussein (Ian Aspinall), manager Bradley Hume, senior house officer Sean Thompson (Chinna Wodu), and a love triangle with married consultant Michael Spence and his cardiothoracic colleague Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Although Michael did not initially disclose to Donna that he was married, Jacobs stated that her character was aware of this [...] "deep down", but was unfortunately unperturbed. He treated her badly, to the point that he would only have sex with her in a toilet stall; nonetheless Jacobs assessed that Donna was in love with him, believing him to be [...] "the one" [...] and different from her previous lovers, branding her deluded in this respect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{precursor}} of <b>The</b> <b>Tart</b> was a Bristol University newspaper edited by Tobes Kelly {{in the first}} six months of 2007. <b>The</b> <b>Tart</b> was set up as a response to a perceived lack of variety in the student newspaper market, and Kelly's desire to revive student satire through enabling and encouraging students to collaborate regardless of university campus borders. The Tart's tone was satirical, and has been described as [...] "tolerant, witty and parodying the folly of those in the public eye". The newspaper was part of the TartMedia Group, which is owned by Kelly.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a positive response}} from trial distributions to London commuters, the decision was taken {{to move out of}} the student market. After securing significant funding, <b>The</b> <b>Tart</b> launched for London commuters in January 2008, and enjoyed a brief run in the capital, at a time when other now-defunct London freesheets such as London Lite and thelondonpaper were also distributed as part of a brief [...] "old-fashioned newspaper war".|$|E

2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be <b>the</b> <b>tart</b> with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked. It's not so much a 'whodunnit?' as a 'who-done-her?'" ...|$|E
