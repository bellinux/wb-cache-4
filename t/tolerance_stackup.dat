50|$|While no {{official}} engineering standard covers the process or format of tolerance analysis and stackups, these are essential components of good product design. Tolerance stackups {{should be used}} {{as part of the}} mechanical design process, both as a predictive and a problem-solving tool. The methods used to conduct a <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup</b> depend somewhat upon the engineering dimensioning and tolerancing standards that are referenced in the engineering documentation, such as American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Y14.5, ASME Y14.41, or the relevant ISO dimensioning and tolerancing standards. Understanding the tolerances, concepts and boundaries created by these standards is vital to performing accurate calculations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tolerance</b> <b>stackups</b> or <b>tolerance</b> stacks {{are used}} to {{describe}} the problem-solving process in mechanical engineering of calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and tolerances. Typically these dimensions and tolerances are specified on an engineering drawing. Arithmetic <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackups</b> use the worst-case maximum or minimum values of dimensions and tolerances to calculate the maximum and minimum distance (clearance or interference) between two features or parts. Statistical <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackups</b> evaluate the maximum and minimum values based on the absolute arithmetic calculation combined with some method for establishing likelihood of obtaining the maximum and minimum values, such as Root Sum Square (RSS) or Monte-Carlo methods.|$|R

Tolerance stack up is term used for describing the problem solving process in designing and manufacturing to calculate the effect of accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and <b>tolerances.</b> The <b>stackup</b> conditions based on worst case (WC) model and RSS model are not realistic in general, though these have been widely used in research because of their simplicity. To account for the realistic nature of the process distribution, a few modifications to these traditional approaches have been proposed. In this paper some nontraditional stack up condition methods like modified RSS Spottâ€™s model and EMS are also analyzed to calculate accumulation of tolerance in assembly. A comparative cost analysis of different stack up models is solved by the combined Simulated Annealing and Pattern Search (SA-PS) algorithm. The application of proposed methodology has been demonstrated through simple shaft bearing examples...|$|R
50|$|Worst-case {{tolerance}} {{analysis is}} the traditional type of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup</b> calculation. The individual variables are placed at their tolerance limits {{in order to make}} the measurement as large or as small as possible. The worst-case model does not consider the distribution of the individual variables, but rather that those variables do not exceed their respective specified limits. This model predicts the maximum expected variation of the measurement. Designing to worst-case tolerance requirements guarantees 100 percent of the parts will assemble and function properly, regardless of the actual component variation. The major drawback is that the worst-case model often requires very tight individual component tolerances. The obvious result is expensive manufacturing and inspection processes and/or high scrap rates. Worst-case tolerancing is often required by the customer for critical mechanical interfaces and spare part replacement interfaces. When worst-case tolerancing is not a contract requirement, properly applied statistical tolerancing can ensure acceptable assembly yields with increased component tolerances and lower fabrication costs.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{decipher}} the process of modelling driving to the product behaviour simulation. A simple example of simulation, <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup,</b> allows illustrating this process. The <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup</b> is used daily in industry, however, designers do they know exactly what they do? Are they aware of the assumptions they are introducing?

40|$|Modeling {{is present}} {{throughout}} the design process. Nevertheless, existing studies generally cover only certain activities, and certain technical points of view: functional analysis, preliminary design, detailed design, simulation (structure, thermal, tolerancing, etc.). The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present a general overview for different types of modeling. This approach allows to describe and to formulate the assumptions made during the development of physical models for the simulation. This process allows to transform a real complex system into a simplified simulation model. This process is defined by a set of operations and is represented by a procedural scheme. The definition of simulation models is the result of this modeling process. These notions are illustrated using a simple example from the geometrical tolerancing domain with modeling by a <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Direct Linearization Method (DLM) for {{tolerance}} {{analysis of}} 3 -D mechanical assemblies is presented. Vector assembly models are used, based on 3 -D vector loops which represent the dimensional chains that produce <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup</b> in an assembly. Tolerance analysis procedures are formulated for both open and closed loop assembly models. The method generalizes assembly variation models to include small kinematic adjustments between mating parts. Open vector loops describe critical assembly features. Closed vector loops describe kinematic constraints for an assembly. They {{result in a}} set of algebraic equations which are implicit functions of the resultant assembly dimensions. A general linearization procedure is outlined, by which the variation of assembly parameters may be estimated explicitly by matrix algebra. Solutions to an over-determined system or a system having more equations than unknowns are included. A detailed example is presented to demonstrate the procedures of applying the DLM to a 3 -D mechanical assembly. 1...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{the moral}} sense of obligation, {{legislative}} and social pressures, manufacturers now consider effective part reuse and material recycling {{at the end}} of product life at the design stage. It is a key consideration to use joints that can disengage with minimum labor, part damage, and material contamination. This paper extends our previous work on the design of high-stiffness reversible locator-snap system that can disengage nondestructively with localized heat (Shalaby and Saitou, 2006, Optimal Heat-Reversible Snap Joints for Frame-Panel Assembly in Aluminum Space Frame Automotive Bodies," Proceedings of the LCE 2006 : The 13 th CIRP International Conference on Life Cycle Engineering, Leuven, Belgium, May 31 -Jun. 2, pp. 411 - 416; Shalaby and Saitou, 2008, "Design for Disassembly With High-Stiffness, Heat-Reversible Locator-Snap Systems," ASME J. Mech. Des., 130 (12), p. 121701) to include (1) modeling for tolerance stack-up and (2) lock-and-key concept to ensure that snaps only disengage when the right procedure is followed. The design problem is posed as an optimization problem to find the locations, numbers, and orientations of locators and snaps, and the locations and sizes of heating areas, to release the snaps with minimum heat, compliance, and <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup.</b> The motion and structural requirements are considered constraints. Screw theory is employed to precalculate the set of feasible types and orientations of locators and snaps that are examined during optimization. Multi-objective genetic algorithm coupled with structural and thermal finite element analysis is used to solve the optimization problem. The method is applied on two case studies. The Pareto-optimal solutions present alternative designs with different trade-offs between the design objectives...|$|E
40|$|Error {{equivalence}} {{concerns the}} mechanism whereby different error sources result in identical deviation and variation patterns on part features. This could have dual effects on process variation reduction: it significantly increases {{the complexity of}} root cause diagnosis in process control, and provides an opportunity to use one error source as based error to compensate the others. There are fruitful research accomplishments on establishing error equivalence methodology, such as error equivalence modeling, and an error compensating error strategy. However, no {{work has been done}} on developing an efficient process design approach by investigating error equivalence. Furthermore, besides the process mean shift, process fault also manifests itself as variation increase. In this regard, studying variation equivalence may help to improve the root cause identification approach. This thesis presents engineering driven approaches for process design and control via embedding error equivalence mechanisms to achieve a better, insightful understanding and control of manufacturing processes. The first issue to be studied is manufacturing process design and optimization based on the error equivalence. Using the error prediction model that transforms different types of errors to the equivalent amount of one base error, the research derives a novel process <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup</b> model allowing tolerance synthesis to be conducted. Design of computer experiments is introduced to assist the process design optimization. Secondly, diagnosis of multiple variation sources under error equivalence is conducted. This allows for exploration and study of the possible equivalent variation patterns among multiple error sources and the construction of the library of equivalent covariance matrices. Based on the equivalent variation patterns library, this thesis presents an excitation-response path orientation approach to improve the process variation sources identification under variation equivalence. The results show that error equivalence mechanism can significantly reduce design space and release us from considerable symbol computation load, thus improve process design. Moreover, by studying the variation equivalence mechanism, we can improve the process diagnosis and root cause identification...|$|E
40|$|Tolerance {{measure is}} an {{important}} part of engineering, however, to date the system of applying this important technology has been left to the assessment of the engineer using appropriate guidelines. This work offers a major departure from the trial and error or random number generation techniques that have been used previously by using a knowledge-based system to ensure the intelligent optimisation within the manufacturing system. A system to optimise manufacturing tolerance allocation to a part known as Knowledge-based Automatic Tolerance Analysis (KATA) has been developed. KATA is a knowledge-based system shell built within AutoCAD. It has the ability for geometry creation in CAD and the capability to optimise the tolerance heuristically as an expert system. Besides the worst-case tolerancing equation to optimise the tolerance allocation, KATA's algorithm is supported by actual production information such as machine capability, types of cutting tools, materials, process capabilities etc. KATA's prototype is currently able to analyse a cylindrical shape workpiece and a simple prismatic part. Analyses of tolerance include dimensional tolerance and geometrical tolerance. KATA is also able to do angular cuts such as tapers and chamfers. The investigation has also led to the significant development of the single tolerance reference technique. This method departs from the common practice of multiple tolerance referencing technique to optimise tolerance allocation. Utilisation of this new technique has eradicated the error of <b>tolerance</b> <b>stackup.</b> The retests have been undertaken, two of which are cylindrical parts meant to test dimensional tolerance and an angular cut. The third is a simple prismatic part to experiment with the geometrical tolerance analysis. The ability to optimise tolerance allocation is based on real production data and not imaginary or random number generation and has improved the accuracy of the expected result after manufacturing. Any failure caused by machining parameters is cautioned at an early stage before an actual production run has commenced. Thus, the manufacturer is assured that the product manufactured will be within the required tolerance limits. Being the central database for all production capability information enables KATA to opt for several approaches and techniques of processing. Hence, giving the user flexibility of selecting the process plan best suited for any required situation...|$|E
