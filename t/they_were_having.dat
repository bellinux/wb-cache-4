5|$|The Germans had not {{achieved}} {{a degree of}} success commensurate with their exertions. Nevertheless, in the belief <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> considerable effect on Fighter Command, they prepared to launch their all-out assault on the RAF the following day. By 12 August, German air strength had reached acceptable levels. After bringing its serviceable rates up, the Luftwaffe began Adlertag with 71 percent of its bomber force, 85 percent of its Bf 109 units, and 83 percent of its Bf 110 units operational.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} to Botany Bay {{on the evening}} of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the year, the Hardy Boyz {{continued}} to win as a tag team, winning the WWF Tag Team Titles two more times, and the WCW Tag Team Championship during the Invasion. By {{the end of}} the year, the Hardy Boyz began a storyline where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> trouble co-existing. This culminated in a match between the two, with Lita as the guest referee, at the Vengeance pay-per-view, which Jeff won.

5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
5|$|In early 2015, the two again began {{showing signs}} of tension between them - with Stardust {{becoming}} further entrenched in his gimmick, leaving Goldust to {{have to try to}} communicate with his brother, Cody; through his new entity. Stardust would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time since}} their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and smooth out the problems <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>having.</b> Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day, Stardust hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached Stardust backstage, Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, and now his own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood. Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody, Goldust won their first encounter via roll-up. Backstage, Stardust viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family's fault for his mental decline.|$|E

Natasha throws a house party, but it gets {{out of control and}} the street is trashed. When Natasha is fined by the police, she is forced to seek {{employment}} to earn some money. She competes with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) for a job at Charlie's and Celeste McIntyre (Cassandra Magrath) gives them both a two-week trial. When Michael informs her that he is selling the house, Natasha tries to put off potential buyers and decides to sabotage Kate's chances of getting the job at Charlie's. Natasha becomes upset when Mason Reeves (Carter Doyle) tries to ask her out, revealing that he saw her pictures online. Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita) comforts Natasha and opens up to her about an abusive relationship that she was once in.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August, and the Luftwaffe quickly {{escalated}} its offensive. The Germans did not achieve {{a degree of}} success commensurate with their exertions on this date. Nevertheless, in the belief <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> considerable effect on Fighter Command, they prepared to launch their all-out assault on the RAF the following day. By 13 August, German air strength had reached acceptable levels. After bringing its serviceable rates up, the Luftwaffe carried out heavy attacks under the codename Adlertag (or Eagle Day), with 71 per cent of its bomber force, 85 per cent of its Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter units, and 83 per cent of its Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter/fighter-bomber units operational. The day went badly for the Germans, who failed to impair Fighter Command and its bases or command and control system. This was {{due in large part}} to poor intelligence, which failed to identify Fighter Command airfields and distinguish them from those of Bomber and Coastal Commands. Still, the Germans pursued their strategy against Fighter Command on 15 August, suffering 76 losses. Undeterred, they prepared to make another large-scale attack on RAF bases on 18 August. The month of August witnessed an escalation in air combat, as the Germans made a concentrated effort against Fighter Command.|$|E

25|$|This was a problem, as some 20,000 mercenaries, {{formerly}} {{under the}} command of Hamilcar Barca (who had resigned his command {{at the end of the}} First Punic War), would shortly be returning from Lilybaeum (modern Marsala in Sicily) to Carthage. Concerned about the possibility of a large, disgruntled, mercenary force encamped near Carthage, Gesco (Gisco), the Carthaginian commandant responsible for transporting the mercenaries from Sicily, attempted to deploy the mercenaries throughout Carthaginian territory. It was his plan to bring the mercenary units back to the capital one at a time, for demobilization and payment. However, delays by the Carthaginian government, and a belief that the mercenaries could be convinced to settle for less than their agreed wages, resulted in the eventual gathering of most of the mercenary armies near Carthage. Wary of such a large foreign army near the capital, and alarmed by the disruptive effects <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> on the city, the Carthaginian government convinced the mercenaries to withdraw to the nearby city of Sicca Veneria (modern El Kef), 170km south-west of Carthage, taking their families and baggage trains with them.|$|E
