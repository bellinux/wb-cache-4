5|$|In June 2006, talks {{concerning}} a territorial {{dispute over the}} Bakassi peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of Cameroon, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and resulted in Cameroonian control of <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally {{handed over to the}} Cameroonian government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to Cameroon 2 years later, in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The hostage-takers {{were members}} of the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA), Iranian Arabs protesting for the {{establishment}} of an autonomous Arab state in the southern region of the Iranian province of Khūzestān (also known as Arabistan) which is home to an Arabic-speaking minority. <b>The</b> <b>oil-rich</b> area had become the source of much of Iran's wealth, having been developed by multi-national companies during the reign of the Shah.|$|E
5|$|As aide-de-camp, Tintin opposes Alcazar's {{decision}} to go to war with neighbouring Nuevo Rico over <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Gran Chapo, and is framed as a traitor by the international oil and weapon companies. He escapes imprisonment with the aid of the mercenary Pablo; and decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbayas, in the hope that they can explain to him why people wish to steal the fetish. From a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was stolen and hidden inside the statue.|$|E
50|$|Harper {{is caught}} up in a power {{struggle}} between Olivia, the owner of <b>the</b> valuable, <b>oil-rich</b> Devereux estate, and oil tycoon Jay Hue Kilbourne (Murray Hamilton), while local police authority Broussard (Anthony Franciosa) has a personal interest in the family and wants the private eye gone.|$|R
50|$|The Delta State People's Democratic Party (also {{known as}} Delta PDP) {{is the state}} level chapter of the People's Democratic Party in Delta State, Nigeria.

25|$|On May 17, 2011 Aktobe was {{the site}} of one of Kazakhstan's first {{terrorist}} attacks, when a suicide bomber blew himself up in the headquarters of the local national security services. Some analysts have interpreted this as a sign of increasing instability in <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich,</b> but socially unequal, region.|$|E
50|$|The April 1978 Marxist {{revolution}} further strained {{relations between}} the two states. Pakistan took the lead diplomatically in the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in opposing the Soviet invasion. It feared that after Afghanistan the Soviets would then enter Pakistani territory, especially the Balochistan region next to <b>the</b> <b>oil-riched</b> Persian Gulf. <b>The</b> United States was more fearing that Soviet reach to the Persian Gulf would threaten or suspend Arab oil supply so it began Operation Cyclone to provide billions of dollars to Pakistan for the training of Mujahideen against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The United States and Saudi Arabia provided as much as $40 billion to Pakistan. Supported and funded by the UNHCR, about 3 million Afghan refugees were allowed to stay in Pakistan, most of them in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.|$|R
50|$|Geologically, the Empty Quarter is <b>the</b> most <b>oil-rich</b> site in <b>the</b> world. Vast oil {{reserves}} {{have been discovered}} underneath the sand dunes. Sheyba, at the northeastern edge of the Rub' al Khali, is a major light crude oil-producing site in Saudi Arabia. Ghawar, the largest oil field in the world, extends southward into the northernmost parts of the Empty Quarter.|$|R
5000|$|In March and April 2003 the Syria Times {{received}} some international attention {{because of its}} harsh condemnation of the US-led war against Iraq, well {{in line with the}} official Syrian discourse in the debates of the UN Security Council. For instance the Irish Times noticed that the “Syria Times attacks Bush's [...] "unholy war" [...] and his [...] "imperialist strategy to control <b>the</b> Arab <b>oil-rich</b> region””.|$|R
25|$|On 18 March 2014, Bahrain's ruler King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa {{started a}} three-day {{official}} visit to Pakistan {{becoming the first}} visit of the King of Bahrain to Pakistan in four decades, during the trip the two sides signed six agreements hoping to draw investment from <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Gulf country.|$|E
25|$|From 1922 to 1924 in Iraq, a Kingdom of Kurdistan existed. When Ba'athist administrators thwarted Kurdish {{nationalist}} ambitions in Iraq, {{war broke}} out in the 1960s. In 1970 the Kurds rejected limited territorial self-rule within Iraq, demanding larger areas including <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Kirkuk region. For recent developments see Iraqi Kurdistan.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January 2015, ISIL {{launched}} a surprise attack on <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Kurdish city of Kirkuk, {{in an attempt}} to draw Kurdish Peshmerga fighters away from Mosul. However, Peshmerga forces managed to staunch the attack and regain some lost territory in the region, with the US ramping up their airstrikes near Kirkuk to 19 on 1 February 2015, in response to the ISIL advance.|$|E

She was released on bail on 21 February 2007 but was required to remain in a hotel while investigations continued. She was eventually freed and returned to the UK in March 2007.|$|R
50|$|The Niger Delta area is <b>oil-rich.</b> <b>The</b> {{government}} has made little to address environmental degradation, endemic {{state and local government}} corruption, or political sponsorship of armed groups, which drive and underlie violence and poverty in the region.|$|R
50|$|A long-standing {{border dispute}} with Cameroon over <b>the</b> {{potentially}} <b>oil-rich</b> Bakassi Peninsula was resolved by a 2002 {{decision by the}} International Court of Justice which granted Cameroon ownership {{of the region and}} the 2006 signing of the Greentree Agreement which led to the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from Bakassi in 2008 and complete administrative control being taken over by Cameroon in August 2013. Nigeria released about 150 Cameroonian prisoners of war in late 1998.|$|R
25|$|Fighting also {{centered}} on the Shabwa Province, in <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Usaylan region, where Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Ansar al-Sharia hold sway. On 29 March, 38 were killed in fighting between the Houthis and Sunni tribesmen. Tribal sources confirmed the death toll, and claimed only eight of them were from their side, with the other 30 either Houthis or their allies from the Yemeni military.|$|E
25|$|Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani {{were engaged}} in heavy {{fighting}} against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. The First Iraqi–Kurdish War (1961–1970) led to a stalemate and in March 1970 Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years. However, at the same time, the Iraqi regime started an Arabization program in <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Afghanistan, Daoud made plans that his government would diminish its {{relationships with the}} Soviet Union, and instead forge closer contacts with the West as well as <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Saudi Arabia and Iran. Afghanistan signed a co-operative military treaty with Egypt and by 1977, the Afghan military and police force were being trained by Egyptian Armed forces. This angered the Soviet Union because Egypt took the same route in 1974 and distanced itself from the Soviets.|$|E
50|$|The lake is {{important}} to <b>the</b> people of <b>oil-rich</b> Njaba River basin including Oguta, Orsu, Mgbidi, Nkwesi, Osemotor, Awo-Omamma and Izombe {{as a source of}} water, fish, tourism and an outlet for sewerage. Uhamiri is the goddess of the Lake.|$|R
40|$|Norway {{is due to}} hold {{parliamentary}} elections in September. Sveinung Arnesen looks ahead to the elections, arguing {{that the cost of}} ruling is taking its toll on the governing centre-left coalition. Despite <b>the</b> country’s <b>oil-rich</b> economy, evidence suggests that the incumbent government is still likely to lose support. He concludes that the stage is set for a centre-right government to come into power in September, unless they stumble like they did in the last elections four years ago...|$|R
40|$|Background: Today, oil, gas, and {{petrochemical}} {{industries are}} of strategic significance in <b>the</b> macro-development of <b>oil-rich</b> countries.

25|$|During the 1960s, Lebanon {{enjoyed a}} period of {{relative}} calm, with Beirut-focused tourism and banking sector-driven prosperity. Lebanon reached the peak of its economic success in the mid-1960s – the country {{was seen as a}} bastion of economic strength by <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Persian Gulf Arab states, whose funds made Lebanon one of the world’s fastest growing economies. This period of economic stability and prosperity was brought to an abrupt halt with the collapse of Yousef Beidas' Intra Bank, the country's largest bank and financial backbone, in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA) is {{the name}} of the United States {{military}} operation to combat militant Islamism and piracy in the Horn of Africa. It is one component of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which includes eight African states stretching from the far northeast of the continent to <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> Gulf of Guinea in the west. The other OEF mission in Africa is known as Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara (OEF-TS), which, until the creation of the new United States Africa Command, was run from the United States European Command.|$|E
25|$|The Tehran Conference in late 1943 was {{the first}} Allied conference in which Stalin was present. At the conference the Soviets {{expressed}} frustration that the Western Allies had not yet opened a second front against Germany in Western Europe. In Tehran, the Allies also considered the political status of Iran. At the time, the British had occupied southern Iran, while the Soviets had occupied an area of northern Iran bordering the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, {{at the end of}} the war, tensions emerged over the timing of the pull out of both sides from <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> region.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the flesh}} of Hodgsonia fruit is {{inedible}} and considered worthless, <b>the</b> large, <b>oil-rich</b> seeds are {{an important source of}} food. The kernels are occasionally eaten raw; they are slightly bitter, possibly due to an unidentified alkaloid or glucoside, but [...] "perfectly safe" [...] to eat. More commonly, the seeds are roasted, after which they taste like pork scraps or lard; many mountain peoples consider these roasted seeds a delicacy. In addition to eating the seeds alone, the Naga incorporate them into various types of curry.|$|R
50|$|In {{the biggest}} {{mobilisation}} of Australian Forces since the Vietnam War, the Government committed Australian naval {{forces to the}} 1991 Gulf War {{in support of the}} United States led coalition against the regime of Saddam Hussein, following <b>the</b> invasion of <b>oil-rich</b> Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August 1990.|$|R
25|$|In {{some other}} parts of the world where it has been introduced, most notably South Australia, the olive has become a major woody weed that {{displaces}} native vegetation. In South Australia, its seeds are spread by the introduced red fox and by many bird species, including the European starling and the native emu, into woodlands, where they germinate and eventually form a dense canopy that prevents regeneration of native trees. As the climate of South Australia is very dry and bushfire prone, <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> feral olive tree substantially increases the fire hazard of native sclerophyll woodlands.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{cannot be}} {{estimated}} {{to what extent}} the boycott hurt Israel's economy, the boycott cannot be said to have affected it to the extent the Arabs intended. Israel's economy has performed relatively well since 1948, achieving a higher GDP per capita than that of all Arab countries except for <b>the</b> <b>oil-rich</b> gulf states of Kuwait and Qatar. The boycott nevertheless has undoubtedly harmed Israel to some extent. The Israeli Chamber of Commerce estimates that with the boycott Israeli exports are 10 percent less than they would be without the boycott and investment in Israel likewise 10 percent lower.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Persian Gulf {{nations of}} Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE {{produced}} about 25% of the world's oil, held {{nearly two-thirds of}} the world's crude oil reserves, and about 35% of the world's natural gas reserves. <b>The</b> <b>oil-rich</b> countries (excluding Iraq) that have a coastline on the Persian Gulf are referred to as the Persian Gulf States. Iraq's egress to the gulf is narrow and easily blockaded consisting of the marshy river delta of the Shatt al-Arab, which carries the waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, where the east bank is held by Iran.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} did {{not take}} part in any true wars during its career with the Fleet Air Arm though it took part in many operations. In 1961, President Abdul Karim Kassem of Iraq threatened to annex <b>the</b> neighbouring <b>oil-rich</b> state of Kuwait. In response to Kuwait's appeal for external help, the United Kingdom dispatched a number of ships to the region, including two fleet carriers. Sea Vixens aboard the fleet carriers flew patrols in the region, and Kassem's aggressive actions wilted {{in the face of}} the strong naval presence, thus averting a war over Kuwait.|$|R
50|$|Intervention {{is needed}} to solve many of these {{infrastructure}} issues in the villages of Awo-Omamma, Izombe, Oguta, <b>the</b> greater <b>oil-rich</b> river basin and many other farming communities in Imo State. Assistance is needed in development of motorable access roads to these fishing villages and ports such as Umuezukwe, Ubahaeze, Abiaziem, Izombe et al. {{as well as in}} support of modern fish and crop processing activities through electricity generation and agricultural subsidies On Monday, January 28, 2013, angry youths protested the State Government’s insensitivity to plight of their people whose roads linking Awo-omamma to Okwudor and other neighbouring communities, they alleged had been abandoned for years by successive administrations in the state.|$|R
50|$|Some analysts {{claim the}} bombings were {{the work of}} Iran in {{cooperation}} with Shia allies from Iraq and Lebanon. Kuwait had given considerable support to Iraq in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War. Between 1983 and 1984, Kuwait provided $7 billion in financial assistance and was second to Saudi Arabia in aiding Iraq, Massive destruction and loss of life in Kuwait would also have provided an example to <b>the</b> other <b>oil-rich,</b> population-poor, Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf, also helping Iraq against its larger, non-Arab, anti-monarchist revolutionary Islamic neighbor. In 1985, the Arab States of the Persian Gulf provided Iraq with financial contributions, totaling {{in the range of}} $40 billion to 50 billion.|$|R
