But {{there is no}} {{evidence}} that this topos existed in the thinking of the Anglo-Saxons, since Old English does not possess the requisite taxonomy, and has difficulty with translations of Latin texts that do.|$|E

However, simulating perpendicular recording {{is itself a}} challenge for several reasons; it requires a large simulation box that includes both write head and hard disk and must be treated at high spatial resolution, and the simulations must run {{for long periods of}} time and for numerous data inputs. To accomplish this complex modeling, we have developed novel techniques which involve a mixed real-space/Fourier-space representation and which compute time scales linearly with system size, enabling large simulations to be performed efficiently. We show tests of our methodology and provide an example of a simulation that involves writing three bits (a <b>tribit)</b> to disk...|$|E
