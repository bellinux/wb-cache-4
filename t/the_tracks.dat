5|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> are powered {{with a third}} rail, except Track 1. The {{station has}} two {{high-level}} side platforms, each eight cars long.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on May 24, 2004, {{construction}} of new platforms began at Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both consist of a single high-level platform {{on the south side}} of <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. Construction at Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished with the opening of the rebuilt station platform on July 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station has}} seen many {{accidents}} and almost-accidents. In 1965, a deadly accident occurred between Ullevål and Berg stations, when a train ran over a 33-year-old man walking in <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> In 2002, a 24-year-old man was {{run over by}} a metro train approaching the station. The man survived the accident with minor wounds. In 2008, a 21-year-old drunk man was found crawling around on <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> between the platforms. The police removed him from the station and sent him home in a taxi.|$|E
50|$|Speedway Miramichi is a 1/3-mile short track {{located in}} Miramichi, New Brunswick. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> {{originally}} opened as a dirt track called Douglastown Speedway but was paved in 1968. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> closed {{a few years}} after opening in 1974. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> was reopened as Williston Speedway. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> ran races with large crowds for years as <b>the</b> <b>track</b> continued improvements. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> also went through several name changes including MacKay Speedway and Miramichi Speedway. In 1997 <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was sold to Reg Tozer and renamed Miramichi City Speedway. Shortly after, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> started running demolition events instead of stock car racing. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> shut down following the 2009 season. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> sat dormant for two seasons {{with the exception of one}} race weekend in September each year. In late 2011, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was sold to Jason Carnahan and David Neilson. The owners renamed <b>the</b> <b>track</b> Speedway Miramichi and have made continuous improvements to the facility, which is currently running 5-6 races per season. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> once had a well known sportsman race called the Brunswick 100.|$|R
50|$|Midget {{car racing}} was invented at <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> <b>track</b> hosted midget car racing from <b>the</b> <b>track's</b> debut in May 1934 to 1950. The 1939 Turkey Night Grand Prix {{was held at}} <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> {{was closed}} from the 1970s to racing, until North Buncombe High School {{was built on}} the {{property}} of <b>the</b> former <b>track.</b> In <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was used as softball fields and sports practice fields. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> itself had been disabled by first placing earthen barriers on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> and later, concrete barriers at 8 locations around <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5|$|East of 21st Street–Queensbridge, {{before the}} IND 63rd Street Line {{connects to the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line, <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> veer left while the tunnel wall goes straight. The bellmouths {{were part of a}} {{proposed}} super-express bypass running under the LIRR mainline between Queens Boulevard and Forest Hills. This plan was not in the original Second System plan, but rather, as part of the Program for Action plan that had <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> from 21st Street–Queensbridge go straight to Forest Hills.|$|E

5|$|In August 2007, the MBTA {{published}} a feasibility study exploring {{the possibility of}} rebuilding Yawkey as a full-service station. The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60%, from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937. On November 15, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station, originally {{expected to be completed}} in the spring of 2012. The new station has two full-length high-level platforms that provide level, handicapped-accessible boarding for all passengers; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility. The two 700-foot-long platforms (a side platform between <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> plus a side platform {{on the south side of}} <b>the</b> <b>tracks)</b> are connected with an overpass, and passengers no longer have to cross <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> to access certain outbound trains.|$|E
50|$|One plan to refloat <b>the</b> <b>track</b> with {{horsemen}} {{investing in}} <b>the</b> <b>track</b> failed. In May 1996, retired newspaper executive Michel St. Louis and 28 other investors purchased <b>the</b> <b>track</b> for $1.2 million and $500,000 in unpaid taxes. St. Louis, a horseman himself, and the investors pooled their RRSP savings to buy <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> <b>track</b> reopened as Hippodrome d'Aylmer on September 29, 1996.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> listing {{for both}} editions is the same. However, the running time {{of most of}} <b>the</b> remastered <b>tracks</b> vary from <b>the</b> {{original}} release due to a different placement of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> marks between songs. In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> mark changes move a song's spoken introduction {{from the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>track</b> to <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> preceding <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> {{originally}} leaked in August 2014, but Kanye {{continued to}} work on <b>the</b> <b>track</b> on and off until March 2015. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> was debuted live at the 2015 Brit Awards on February 26, 2015.

5|$|Made up {{of various}} {{unreleased}} tracks, b-sides, and singles, the album contains tracks from the band's first recording session in March 1990, {{as well as}} recordings sourced from several live performances. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> feature various bassists and drummers from past lineups, including drummers Caroline Rue and Patty Schemel, and bassists Jill Emery and Kristen Pfaff. Frontwoman Courtney Love is also featured playing bass guitar in one of <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The album is dedicated to Pfaff's memory.|$|E
5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed from the gate) is allowed. In heavy snow conditions <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> can become clogged up, which reduces inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> from clogging up with snow.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{constructed}} in 1910, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was renovated in 1933 and was 1525 m long. Costing RM 155,000 to complete, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> {{was used for}} the 1936 Games. Having seven different seating locations, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> could seat 17,940 and the events were sold out during competition. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> was demolished in 1966. Remnants of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> can be seen on sleigh rides near the lake.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>track</b> are extant at Middle Bluff, <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> however, is not {{particularly}} clear. Following the path north the North Bluff lighthouse, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> becomes clearer. At one point, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> disappears and reappears further along. <b>The</b> rock-lined <b>track</b> runs for approximately four kilometres, apart from the section (of around one kilometre) where it disappears.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> had {{an annual}} American Speed Association event. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> resumed hosting ASA events after {{the series was}} reorganized, and it held an event in 2007. Earlier the USAC Stock Car series had raced at <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> ASA series {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>track</b> in 2014 now sanctioned as the ARCA Midwest Tour.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> is {{constructed}} with about 54 mi of ammonia refrigeration pipes to help form ice on <b>the</b> <b>track</b> for proper sliding. Numerous sensors located along <b>the</b> <b>track</b> ensure that <b>the</b> ice's thickness is kept between 5 and 10 cm to keep <b>the</b> <b>track</b> properly smooth during competitions.|$|R
50|$|A plastic {{piece at}} one end of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> serves as both a {{handhold}} for the toy and an adjustable slider to position the width of <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> narrower <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> <b>the</b> faster the wheel goes, because the axle is thicker in the middle and you get more distance per each rotation of the wheel. Widen <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> and <b>the</b> wheel goes slower.|$|R
5|$|The Superliner I cars stored {{waste in}} onboard {{retention}} tanks, but then macerated and dumped it along <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> once the train had attained a preset speed. This was an improvement on the Hi-Levels, which dumped directly to <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> Growing public concern about such dumping {{led to the}} adoption of a full-retention system in the Superliner IIs. They were the first long-distance cars with such a system. The Superliner I cars were retrofitted with a full-retention system in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The railroad's Purdy's {{station is}} a short {{distance}} west of the next junction, NY116, after which NY22 crosses under I-684, remaining {{between it and the}} railroad tracks. Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> away from the interstate {{to the site of the}} next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, Route22 crosses under <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> and is joined by US202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|The track layout is {{such that}} each line has its own pair of tracks {{and a pair of}} double {{switches}} between these tracks, and each service has its own island platform serving these tracks. In regular operation, no service needs to cross over <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> of another service. <b>The</b> <b>tracks</b> are numbered sequentially from east to west, with the N train at tracks 1 and 2; the Q at tracks 3 and 4; the F at tracks 5 and 6; and the D at tracks 7 and 8.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> is {{continued}} {{briefly in}} the absence of any detections. Tracks with no detections become coasted <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> velocity information is used to move <b>the</b> <b>track</b> volume through space briefly as <b>the</b> <b>track</b> volume is expanded.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>tracking</b> {{convergent}} {{property is}} an important guideline for a reticle seeker. <b>The</b> <b>tracking</b> of <b>the</b> reticle seeker {{is driven by the}} period mean torque which is generated by <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> signal. In this paper, the convergent property of the reticle seeker was analyzed and some significant conclusions were attained using series theory. The convergence of <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> procession was affected by both <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> coefficient and <b>the</b> phase bias Δθ between the target location and <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> signal. <b>The</b> convergent conditions and the convergent step function were also obtained. These conclusions are important for the design of <b>the</b> convergent <b>tracking</b> algorithm of <b>the</b> reticle seeker. 中国科学院光电信息处理重点实验室基金(OEIP- 0201103...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> {{was built}} in 1968, {{originally}} as a clay oval and called Raven Speedway. Current NASCAR CEO Brian France took over operations of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> in 1990.

5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. <b>The</b> <b>tracks</b> were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response to a common criticism of the original Destruction Derby, <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to one stop because the team {{did not want to}} detract from the action and because a penalty system would have added a lot of extra work. Cars nearing destruction were designed to behave in a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the bonnet (hood) and catching on fire.|$|E
5|$|When the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western {{expanded}} the Kingsland Shops in 1903, a new station depot was constructed of brick {{along with a}} cut and cover tunnel. The tunnel itself cost $71,500 (1903 USD) and permitted the local street, Schuyler Avenue to cross over the rail line. The new station depot was built on Ridge Road over <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> with platforms crossing over the new bridge. The design of the station depot located above <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> was later replicated by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western's Montclair Branch for its Watsessing Avenue station in Bloomfield, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|A few {{copies of}} the {{original}} pressing of the LP with the four deleted tracks have turned up over the years, despite Columbia's supposed destruction of all copies during the pre-release phase (all copies found were in the standard album sleeve with the revised track selection). Other permutations of the Freewheelin album include versions with a different running order of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> on the album, and a Canadian version of the album that listed <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in the wrong order. The original pressing of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is considered the most valuable and rarest record in America, with one copy having sold for $35,000.|$|E
50|$|The velodrome is outdoor and uncovered. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> is 1093.6 ft (333.3 m) {{in length}} with a {{concrete}} surface. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> has 30-degree banked turns and 12.5-degree straightaways. At {{the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>track</b> is an 8 feet (2.4 m) concrete apron. Time trial lines are painted on <b>the</b> <b>track</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|Costing about $25 million US$ to construct, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> uses 297,000 {{watts of}} track lighting, 62 water hydrants, 24 cameras, eight scoreboards, and 49 timing points. Generally open from October {{to the end}} of March annually, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> takes a total of 18 days to ice down to the {{required}} thickness needed to run sliding events. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> has 54 mi of piping with 110000 lb of ammonia refrigeration able to keep <b>the</b> <b>track</b> to -14 F. During operating season, a nine-man crew smooths <b>the</b> <b>track</b> every day. A total of 59 temperature probes are located throughout <b>the</b> <b>track</b> to ensure <b>the</b> ice temperature is properly monitored. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> a $1 million retractable shading system protects the course from sun and snow, which reduces energy usage by 25 percent and the need to clear <b>the</b> <b>track</b> from snow.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} to separate <b>the</b> <b>track</b> noise contribution is proposed based on identifying and extracting <b>the</b> <b>track</b> signature from <b>the</b> pass-by noise information {{measured with a}} microphone array relatively close to <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> Separation of <b>the</b> contributions of the vehicle and <b>the</b> <b>track</b> in <b>the</b> pass-by noise spectra is a challenging task, which is currently addressed {{by a combination of}} direct and indirect measurements and model predictions. Due to the uncertainties in the separation of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> contribution, whether a vehicle will comply with regulations during certification tests is still very much track dependent. Therefore, accurate means to identify <b>the</b> <b>track</b> contribution to <b>the</b> pass-by noise are needed. In this paper we propose {{to make use of the}} fact that in a wide frequency range <b>the</b> <b>track</b> is a distributed source that radiates plane waves at a given angle with respect to <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> By measuring <b>the</b> sound field close to <b>the</b> <b>track</b> with a microphone array, the wavenumber spectrum of the radiated sound can be determined. For <b>the</b> <b>track</b> contribution this wavenumber spectrum is tonal and therefore sparse. We make use of this property to design filters that extract <b>the</b> <b>track</b> contribution to <b>the</b> total pass-by noise. This is illustrated with simulations and experiments.   QC 20160913 Roll 2 Rai...|$|R
