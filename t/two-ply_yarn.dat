2500|$|Yarns {{can be made}} of two, three, four, or more plies, or {{may be used as}} singles without plying. <b>Two-ply</b> <b>yarn</b> {{can also}} be plied from both ends of one long strand of singles using a centre-pull ball, where one end feeds from within a ball of yarn while the other end feeds from the outside. [...] So-called [...] "Andean" [...] plying, in which the single is first wound around one hand in a {{specific}} manner that allows unwinding both ends at once without tangling, is another way to ply smaller amounts of yarn. [...] The name comes from a method used by Andean spinners to manage and splice unevenly matched singles being plied from multiple spindles. [...] "Navajo" [...] (aka [...] "chain-") plying is another method of producing a three-ply yarn, in which one strand of singles is looped around itself {{in a manner similar to}} crochet and the resulting three parallel strands twisted together. This method is often used to keep colours together on singles dyed in sequential colours. Cabled yarns are usually four-ply yarns made by plying two strands of <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn</b> together in the direction opposite to the plying direction for the two-ply yarns.|$|E
50|$|The {{creation}} of <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn</b> requires two separate spools of singles and either a lazy kate {{or something to}} hold the spools in place. On a wheel, two-ply is created by taking two spools of singles, placing them on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the spool attached to the wheel, and spinning the wheel {{in the opposite direction}} to that in which the singles were spun, while also feeding the yarn onto the spool on the wheel. On a drop spindle, two-ply is created by placing the spools on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the drop spindle, holding equal lengths of singles together and dropping the spindle. The weight of the drop spindle combined with the twist in the singles, causes the drop spindle to turn in the opposite direction that the singles were twisted in until the two singles are plied together.|$|E
50|$|Preparing {{the fiber}} was an {{extensive}} process that involved cleaning and teasing the fiber, spinning the yarn and plying it, dyeing the coloured yarns, and lastly weaving. Creating the yarn {{was done with}} a shank which is usually 2-3 ft. long and holds the stone or preferably whalebone whorl. The spindle is rotated by striking the lower side of the whorl with the right hand, while {{the upper end of}} the shank is held between the thumb and forefinger of the other hand, and the lower end rests on the ground. Using the spindle the two strands of yarn are twisted round each other into a single thread. Goat hair was always spun “s” meaning that the whorl would be turned counterclockwise in spinning. As goat hair was always made into <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn,</b> the doubled yarn would have been spun by attaching two lengths of single -ply “s” spun yarn and then turning the whorl clockwise in a “l” twist.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{analysis of the}} mechanical governing equations applying to the torsional behaviour of multi-ply yarns under tension has been carried out. This analysis clearly shows {{that there are two}} components, a geometric component that determines the slope or gradient of the torque due to tension and a component that determines the yarn torque at zero applied tension (intrinsic torque) that depends on the fibre number, fibre moduli and diameter as well as the strand structural geometry. The effect of the ratio of the ply twist to the spinning twist on the two components of yarn torque has been numerically analysed for two-, three- and four-ply yarns prepared from singles 31 yarns spun with different spinning twists and for two different fibre diameters. Other comparisons are made for <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarns</b> prepared from 40 and 80 tex singles yarn. The model allows the effects of the various yarn and fibre parameters to be assessed and compared with experimental data. Experimental torque data for a range of <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarns</b> plied at different percentages of the singles spinning twist and also with different yarn histories and test environments are consistent with the trends identified by the model...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a flexible two-ply piezoelectric yarn-type generator using an electrospun polyvinylidenefluoride-co- trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) mat and a commercially available silver-coated nylon fiber. By rolling the silver-coated nylon fiber into the electrospun PVDF-TrFE mat as the inner electrode, the two-dimensional piezoelectric PVDF-TrFE mat was easily {{transformed into a}} one-dimensional fiber. Then silver-coated nylon fiber rolled in PVDF-TrFE was plied with another similar fiber to make a flexible <b>two-ply</b> piezoelectric <b>yarn.</b> The overall fabrication processes of the flexible <b>two-ply</b> piezoelectric <b>yarn</b> are simple and have a high application potential. The flexible <b>two-ply</b> piezoelectric <b>yarn</b> can generate up to 0. 7 V in compression and 0. 55 V in tension. The yarn retained the piezoelectric performance in various shapes, such as a sewn structure. In addition, the piezoelectric performance was sensitive to velocity and pressure. The flexible <b>two-ply</b> piezoelectric <b>yarn</b> has potential applications as a human motion sensor, as a building block of energy- harvesting textiles, and in self-powered biomedical applications.

50|$|A hand {{woven textile}} sling was {{collected}} by Loud in 1912 {{but it was}} not reported or studied extensively until years later. Archaeologists are interested in the specific specimen because it is {{recognized as one of the}} earliest slings in North America. The Indians of the Northern Paiute or Paviotso were occupants of the area during historic times and they recognized the sling as a toy or used for hunting and war. Slings were known to serve different purposes such as a toy, a forehead band, or a mechanism for hunting birds. The design of the sling found at Lovelock was constructed through a simple knotting technique from a <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn.</b> The pattern on the sling is reversible. It was likely made from various pieces of available fiber. The sling found at Lovelock is just one of the many handmade textile items of the cave. Traps and nets were also crafted to assist hunters during their search for food. Baskets and other food storage items were used to ensure that during times of resource scarcity everyone would have enough food for survival.|$|E
40|$|Spirality is a {{particularly}} serious problem for plain knitted fabrics due to asymmetric loops. This study investigates {{the relationship between the}} spirality of plain wool knits and various variables. The experimental results show that the twist factor of two-ply wool yarn is the most important factor influencing fabric spirality. Loop length and fiber diameter also show significant effects. In general, increasing the twist factor of <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn,</b> loop length, and fiber diameter increases the angle of spirality. The experimental results demonstrate that relaxation treatment of fabrics in water decreases the angle of spirality. The experimental data also lead to the derivation of empirical equations linking the angle of spirality to the twist factor of <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn,</b> loop length, and fiber diameter in both the dry relaxed and simulated industrial relaxed states.

40|$|A {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) sewing thread has been {{designed}} which consists of a <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn</b> in a 122 turns-per-meter-twist construction. Two processing aids in thread construction were evaluated. Prototype blankets were sewn using an SiC thread prepared either with polytetrafluoroethylene sizing or with an overwrap of rayon/dacron service yarn. The rayon/dacron-wrapped SiC thread was stronger, as shown by higher break-strength retention and less damage to the outer-mold-line fabric. This thread enables thermal protection system articles to be sewn or joined, or have perimeter close-out of assembled parts when using SiC fabric for high-temperature applications...|$|E
50|$|The first {{waxed cotton}} {{products}} of Egyptian cotton with linseed oil applied, started to appear from the mid-1850s. Tea clipper sails {{were made from}} strong <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarns</b> in both warp and weft, which provided lighter cloth with extra strength for the larger sails. The recipe for waxing each cloth remained unique to that cloth, but all cloths suffered the same problems: stiffness in the cold; and a tendency to turn a shade of yellow towards that of pure linseed oil, creating the early yellow of fisherman's clothing.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Fair Isle or Shetland garments, however, Cowichan sweaters {{are always}} hand knit of thick, handspun, one-ply natural-coloured yarn {{in two or}} three colours (generally cream, black and grey), {{producing}} a warm bulky outer garment that is heavier than the multi-coloured Scottish garments made from lightweight <b>two-ply</b> dyed <b>yarn.</b>|$|R
40|$|Color {{discrimination}} and desirable melange {{effect in the}} colored <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarns</b> were assessed by 20 observers in visual testing the seriplanes of the plied two-colored yarns together with the dyed single yarns of three primary colors and of 12 vivid colors, respectively, which were carefully prepared after color-matching with the color cards of vivid tone on the color ring of PCCS (Practical Color Coordinate System). The results of the color {{discrimination and}} desirable color combinations were discussed in the relation to color {{differences between the two}} colors in the ply yarns. It was necessary for desirable melange color effect of the two colored ply yarns to select medium hue contrast combination. High hue contrast combination to be consequently high color differences between the two colored yarns led the color discrimination to improve, while it also led the desirable melange effect to change for the worse. The result of the desirable color effects in the colored yarns was different from that in the colored fiber assemblies previously reported, due to size as a visual object...|$|R
40|$|As an {{electrical}} double layer capacitor, dry-spun carbon nanotube yarn possesses relatively low specific capacitance. This can be significantly increased {{as a result}} of the pseudocapacitance of functional groups on the carbon nanotubes developed by oxidation using a gamma irradiation treatment in the presence of air. When coated with high-performance polyaniline nanowires, the gamma-irradiated carbon nanotube yarn acts as a high-strength reinforcement and a high-efficiency current collector in <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn</b> supercapacitors for transporting charges generated along the long electrodes. The resulting supercapacitors demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, cycle stability, and resistance to folding-unfolding that are required in wearable electronic textiles...|$|E
40|$|Yarn supercapacitors {{have great}} {{potential}} in future portable and wearable electronics {{because of their}} tiny volume, flexibility and weavability. However, low-energy density limits their development {{in the area of}} wearable high-energy density devices. How to enhance their energy densities while retaining their high-power densities is a critical challenge for yarn supercapacitor development. Here we propose a coaxial wet-spinning assembly approach to continuously spin polyelectrolyte-wrapped graphene/carbon nanotube core-sheath fibres, which are used directly as safe electrodes to assembly <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarn</b> supercapacitors. The yarn supercapacitors using liquid and solid electrolytes show ultra-high capacitances of 269 and 177 mFcm 2 and energy densities of 5. 91 and 3. 84 mWhcm 2, respectively. A cloth supercapacitor superior to commercial capacitor is further interwoven from two individual 40 -cm-long coaxial fibres. The combination of scalable coaxial wet-spinning technology and excellent performance of yarn supercapacitors paves the way to wearable and safe electronics...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{geometrical}} model {{was introduced to}} improve the hair trapping via a surface contacting the yarn-twisting triangle during ring twisting of two single yarns. The fiber-trapping improvement with the contact surface was analyzed theoretically. Then, single Ne 80 ring cotton yarns were used to produce <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarns</b> under different ring-twisting conditions, namely conventional twisting, dry twisting of yarns with a plane surface, wet twisting of yarns with a plane surface, dry twisting of yarns with a grooved surface, and wet twisting of yarns with a grooved surface. Plied yarn properties, including yarn hairiness, strength, and irregularity, were tested. The Student Newman Keuls (SNK) test and variation analysis were also {{carried out in the}} SPSS program to study the effect of different contact surfaces on related yarn properties; the significance level was 0. 05 for the SNK test and variation analysis. The hairiness of plied yarns was significantly reduced when twisting with the plane or grooved surface, especially for the wet twisting cases. This corresponds well with our model on improving fiber trapping. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|Thread {{count is}} often used {{as a measure of}} fabric quality, so that [...] "standard" [...] cotton thread counts are around 150 while good-quality sheets start at 180 and a count of 200 or higher is {{considered}} percale. Some, but not all, of the extremely high thread counts (typically over 500) tend to be misleading as they usually count the individual threads in [...] "plied" [...] yarns (a yarn that is made by twisting together multiple finer threads). For marketing purposes, a fabric with 250 <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarns</b> in both the vertical and horizontal direction could have the component threads counted to a 1000 thread count although [...] "according to the National Textile Association (NTA), which cites the international standards group ASTM, accepted industry practice is to count each thread as one, even threads spun as two- or three-ply yarn. The Federal Trade Commission in an August 2005 letter to NTA agreed that consumers 'could be deceived or misled' by inflated thread counts. In 2002, ASTM proposed a definition for [...] "thread count" [...] that has been called [...] "the industry's first formal definition for thread count". A minority on the ASTM committee argued for the higher yarn count number obtained by counting each single yarn in a plied yarn and cited as authority the provision relating to woven fabric in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, which states each ply should be counted as one using the [...] "average yarn number." ...|$|R
40|$|Until now, {{describing}} yarn {{structure has}} been more art than science, especially for complex yarns and cordage like those encountered at Cerrillos, a Paracas (ca. 900 - 100 B. C. E.) site in the Ica Valley of Peru, where yarns and cordage frequently involve multiple colors, sub-structures, and materials (e. g., Image 1). My early attempts at describing yarn structures using notation were essentially undecipherable to others. Likewise, narrative methods proved too wordy and no less confusing. (For instance, a narrative description {{of the structure of}} specimen 2001 -L 185 -B 1654 - S 001, a rope-like yarn pictured in Images 2 and 3, would be: Twelve Z-spun-singly-ply yarns Ztwisted with six <b>two-ply</b> <b>yarns,</b> each Z-spun-S-plied, the resulting yarn being doubled and twisted S.) Using a depictive (diagrammatic) method of recording structure (Image 4), albeit unambiguous, nonetheless proved difficult-to-impossible to reproduce as text on a printed page (i. e., it must be treated as an image). As an alternative to these unsatisfactory methods, I developed a new technique called parenthetical notation, which can describe any yarn, however complex, {{in a way that is}} both intuitive and flexible. Using parenthetical notation, the yarn in Images 2 and 3, for instance, is described as S(2 z(12 z+ 6 S(2 z))). Among its other practical benefits, parenthetical notation makes it easy for researchers to tabulate yarn structures so they can be sorted and statistically analyzed. In this talk, aside from presenting a brief history of yarnstructure notation, using examples from my research, I will demonstrate how parenthetical notation works so people can apply it to their own projects...|$|R
