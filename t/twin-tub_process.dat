40|$|In {{this paper}} a bulk twin-tub and an {{epitaxial}} CMOS technology are studied {{from the viewpoint}} of latch-up hardness reduction due to interaction between adjacent structures, by means of static triggering measurements performed on "ad hoc" test patterns. The experimental results indicate that such interactions can seriously increase the latch-up susceptibility of the devices under test {{in the case of the}} bulk <b>twin-tub</b> <b>process,</b> while the epitaxial one shows in general better stability of the latch-up behavior...|$|E
40|$|We {{present in}} this work an {{analysis}} of transiently triggered latch-up in test structures fabricate using a <b>twin-tub</b> <b>process</b> implemented on two different substrates: a p-type and a p/p+ epitaxial one. Steady-state electrical characterization confirmed the well-known increased latch-up resistance of epitaxial structures with respect to standard ones. In this paper it is shown that, depending on the chosen electrical configuration, when latch-up is transiently triggered, epitaxial structures may have dynamic triggering currents lower than twin-tub ones. The influence of some layout variables on turn-on threshold voltage has been investigated for all samples...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a design {{solution}} for implementing high-value resistance circuit, intended to bias the floating gate of PolyVinyliDene Fluorine (PVDF) based tactile sensors. The solution was proposed to design circuits based on Twin-tub and N-well processes. The formulations of mathematical equations {{were derived from}} EKV model. Our simulation results are in terms of frequency and transient responses, and they show that both the circuits were able to realize very high value of resistance suited for this sensor application in typical cases. However, in terms of process, voltage, and temperature variations, the results shown by the N-well process were better {{than those of the}} <b>Twin-tub</b> <b>process</b> at corner cases...|$|E
