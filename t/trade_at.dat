5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade.

5|$|In 1497 Bristol was the {{starting}} point for John Cabot's voyage of exploration to North America. For many years Bristol merchants had bought freeze-dried cod, called stockfish, from Iceland for consumption in England. However the Hanseatic League, which was trying to control North Atlantic <b>trade</b> <b>at</b> this time, sought to cut off supplies to English merchants. It has often been suggested that this drove Bristol's merchants to look West for new sources of cod fish. On the other hand, while Bristol merchants did largely abandon Iceland in the late-15th century, Hull merchants continued to trade there. Moreover, recent research has shown that England's fisheries off Iceland actually grew significantly from the 1490s, albeit the centre for this activity shifted from Bristol to East Anglia. This makes it hard to sustain the argument that Bristol merchants were somehow 'pushed out' of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Moncton's {{shipbuilding}} era {{began in}} 1840 {{with the arrival}} of Stewart Russell, a shipbuilder from Hopewell. Russell built the Aginora, which sailed down the Petitcodiac River to <b>trade</b> <b>at</b> the ports in Saint John and New England. The ship and its crew sank in a storm on 24 December 1850, during a trip to Boston for Christmas. A ferry service on the Petitcodiac River was launched around 1841, thanks to a license obtained by Simon Outhouse. The Larch, built by Stephen Binney in 1845, was another important vessel, becoming the largest to sail on the river. But {{it was not until the}} arrival of Joseph Salter in 1846 that the shipbuilding boom began: a shipyard founded by Binney and Salter produced 24 vessels from 1847 to 1859, and employed almost 500 of the 1,000 inhabitants in Moncton. Salter would become the first mayor of Moncton in April 1855, the year the town was incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Northern England, as {{the first}} area {{in the world to}} industrialise, was the birthplace of much modern {{political}} thought. Reports into the lives of the Northern working class, from Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England to George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier, shaped Marxism and, more generally, socialism. Meanwhile, enterprise and <b>trade</b> <b>at</b> the North's ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a laissez-faire free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian, the movement's greatest success was the repeal of the Corn Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} Penang was {{established}} as a port by the British {{at the end of}} the 18th century, Vietnamese junks began to visit the area for <b>trade</b> <b>at</b> the instruction of the Vietnamese emperor in Hue. An early account in the late 1790s showed Nguyen Anh's (who became Emperor Gia Long) merchant ship docking in Penang carrying cargoes of sugarcane en route to India. Soldiers referred to Penang in its Sino-Vietnamese terminology, Tân Lang dữ (Chinese character: 檳榔嶼); a royal narrative in 1810 showed the Vietnamese began to refer to Penang as Cù lao Cau, meaning Palm Island. Vietnamese Catholics travelled to Penang for seminary studies from the 1840s; these included illuminary Pétrus Ky. ethnic Chinese from Cochinchina sailed to the east in the Sultanate of Terengganu to trade in poultry and rice; some also settled there and assimilated with the local Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season {{fears of}} a {{conflict}} with Keenan were realized, as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was not comfortable with.

He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet {{so as not to}} become a distraction to the team, although Tanguay's request was revealed in the off-season.

The Flames' first selection was early in the third round, a pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Anton Stralman. They selected Max Reinhart with that pick. His father Paul was also a former Flames draft pick. Calgary made one <b>trade</b> <b>at</b> the draft, sending their sixth round pick (163rd overall) to the Sharks in exchange for goaltender Henrik Karlsson.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} the trans-Atlantic slave trade {{increased}} maritime <b>trade</b> <b>at</b> Malagasy ports, including food products. In 1696, a trading vessel {{en route to the}} American colonies reportedly took a stock of local Malagasy rice to Charleston, South Carolina, where the grain formed the basis of the plantation industry. Trading ships brought crops from the Americas—such as sweet potato, tomato, maize, peanuts, tobacco and lima beans—to Madagascar in the 16th and 17thcenturies; cassava arrived after 1735 from a French colony at nearby Réunion Island. These products were first cultivated in coastal areas nearest to their ports of arrival, but soon spread throughout the island; within 100years of their introduction they were widespread throughout the central highlands. Similarly, pineapple and citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, consumed by sailors to ward off scurvy on long cross-Atlantic trips, were introduced at coastal Malagasy ports. Local cultivation began soon afterward.|$|E
5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle <b>trade.</b> <b>At</b> the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Sutter {{engineered}} a seven player <b>trade</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} January {{that sent}} Dion Phaneuf and Fredrik Sjostrom to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for four players led by Matt Stajan, Ian White and Niklas Hagman. The deal ended weeks of speculation about the Calgary defenceman's future amid reports that Phaneuf had requested a trade – a claim he had denied. One day later, the Flames sent Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins. The deals resulted in the change of over {{one third of the}} roster in the period of a day, moves that were seen as a sign of panic as the Flames hovered around the final playoff spot. While rumours circulated that Phaneuf was dealt because he was a divisive influence in the locker room, Jokinen later blamed the fans in Calgary for the defenceman's departure. Jokinen admitted that he was traded because he failed to produce in Calgary, while in Kotalik, the Flames received a player who was having a similarly disappointing season in New York.|$|E
