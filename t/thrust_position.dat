5000|$|INTERSTATE AVIATION COMMITTEEFINAL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT, page 115The {{cause of}} Sibir A-310 F-OGYP {{accident}} was the erroneous and uncontrolled {{actions by the}} crew during rollout after landing in a configuration with one engine reverser deactivated.

50|$|One common active {{clearance}} control {{consists of}} the ACC valve which mixes hot and cold air from the compressor exit and the bypass duct, respectively, to a desired temperature. The air is routed to flow through tubes surrounding the casing at each turbine stage. This air expands or contracts the turbine case and in doing so, it maintains the accurate clearance between the turbine case and the blade tip.

25|$|Attempts to {{actively}} expel {{water from the}} airway by abdominal <b>thrusts</b> or <b>positioning</b> head downwards should be avoided as they delay the start of ventilation and {{increase the risk of}} vomiting, with a significantly increased risk of death, as aspiration of stomach contents is a common complication of resuscitation efforts. Administration of oxygen at 15 litres per minute by face mask or bag mask is often sufficient, but tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against the need for oxygenisation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve oxygenation.|$|R

40|$|Potentially low lithospheric densities, {{caused by}} high Venus surface and perhaps mantle temperatures, could inhibit the {{development}} of negative buoyancy-driven subduction and a global system of plate tectonics/crustal recycling on that planet. No evidence for a global plate tectonic system was found so far, however, specific features strongly resembling terrestrial subduction zones in planform and topographic cross-section were described, including trenches around large coronae and chasmata in eastern Aphrodite Terra. The cause for the absence, or an altered expression, of plate tectonics on Venus remains to be found. Slab buoyancy {{may play a role}} in this difference, with higher lithospheric temperatures and a tendency toward positive buoyancy acting to oppose the descent of slabs and favoring under thrusting instead. The effect of slab buoyancy on subduction was explored and the conditions which would lead to under thrusting versus those allowing the formation of trenches and self-perpetuating subduction were defined. Applying a finite element code to assess the effects of buoyant forces on slabs subducting into a viscous mantle, it was found that mantle flow induced by horizontal motion of the convergent lithosphere greatly influences subduction angle, while buoyancy forces produce a lesser effect. Induced mantle flow tends to decrease subduction angle to near an under <b>thrusting</b> <b>position</b> when the subducting lithosphere converges on a stationary overriding lithosphere. When the overriding lithosphere is in motion, as in the case of an expanding corona, subduction angles are expected to increase. An initial stage involved estimating the changes in slab buoyancy due to slab healing and pressurization over the course of subduction. Modeling a slab, descending at a fixed angle and heated by conduction, radioactivity, and the heat released in phase changes, slab material density changes due to changing temperature, phase, and pressure were derived...|$|R

40|$|To be {{published}} in the proceedings of the 27 th AAS/AIAA Spaceflight Mechanics Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Feb. 6 - 9, 2017 In this paper, we develop a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach for spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD) with a rotating target platform. A strategy to enforce and handle constraints is proposed for collision-free and soft docking while real-time computation is achieved. In the strategy, constraints on <b>thrust,</b> spacecraft <b>positioning</b> within the entry cone from the docking port, and collision avoidance are systemically treated and switched in two-phase spacecraft RVD maneuvering. Dynamically reconfigurable constraints with a switching algorithm are introduced to guide the chaser spacecraft into the docking port in the final docking phase. The performance of the developed NMPC controller is analyzed for test cases using a MATLAB/Simulink-based simulator. The controller is also implemented on an air-bearing test bed to demonstrate the capability to perform real-time computation and to satisfy constraints...|$|R
