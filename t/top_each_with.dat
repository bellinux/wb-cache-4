50|$|The brown tubular sponge {{is a large}} sponge forming mounds {{that may}} be a metre (yard) across. The base is encrusted on the {{substrate}} or may develop lobes but above this there are several dozen large vertical tubes, narrowing at the <b>top,</b> <b>each</b> <b>with</b> a hollow centre or atrium and a large hole or osculum at the apex. They are up to 16 cm long and 8 cm wide and are soft, elastic and resilient. The walls are strengthened by a skeleton of spongin fibres and tiny calcareous spicules. On the side of these tubes there are deep grooves and shallow cup shaped depressions up to 2.5 cm across each occupied by a dark reddish brown zoanthid (Parazoanthus sp.). This is a colonial coral living symbiotically with the sponge and the polyps are connected together by tissue called coenenchyme inside the atrium of the sponge. The general colour of the sponge is brownish orange or brick red.|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} and analysis is given of a wetness duration experiment, {{carried out in}} a potato field in {{the centre of the}} Netherlands in September 2005. The observations are used to design and evaluate a within-canopy dew model which provides the leaf wetness distribution within the canopy caused by dew processes and by precipitation. This withincanopy dew model consists of three layers (bottom, centre, <b>top)</b> <b>each</b> <b>with</b> equal contribution to the leaf area index. The model results compared favourably with experimental evidence. The sensitivity of the dew and precipitation interception on the amount of free water and the duration of the leaf wetness was analysed by varying the leaf area index and some important weather variables. The findings suggest that the leaf area index affects the amount of free water, but is barely sensitive to leaf wetness duration. Wind speed has hardly any effect on the amount of free water collection as well as on leaf wetness duration. The net radiation, however, appears {{to be sensitive to the}} amount of collected free water as well as the leaf wetness duratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{time-varying}} {{feature of}} wireless channels usu-ally makes the hard delay bound for data transmissions unre-alistic to guarantee. In contrast, the statistically-bounded delay {{with a small}} violation probability has been widely used for delay quality-of-service (QoS) characterization and evaluation. While existing research mainly focused on the statistical-delay control in single-hop links, {{in this paper we}} propose the QoS-driven power-allocation scheme over two-hop wireless relay links to statistically upper-bound the end-to-end delay under the decode-and-forward (DF) relay transmissions. Specifically, by applying the effective capacity and effective bandwidth theories, we first analyze the delay-bound violation probability over two <b>tops</b> <b>each</b> <b>with</b> independent service processes. Then, we show that an efficient approach for statistical-delay guarantees is to make the delay distributions of both hops identical, which, however, needs to be obtained through asymmetric resource allocations over the two hops. Motivated by this fact, we formulate and solve an optimization problem aiming at minimizing the average power consumptions to satisfy the specified end-to-end delay-bound violation probability over two-hop relay links. Also conducted is a set of simulations results to show the impact of the QoS requirements, traffic load, and position of the relay node on the power allocation under our proposed optimal scheme.
