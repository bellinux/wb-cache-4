5|$|Anoplotherium is an extinct mammal {{from the}} Eocene to Oligocene epochs, first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's {{speculation}} about its camel-like appearance. (<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> {{thought to be}} related to hippopotamus and pigs). Three models were made, forming a small herd.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Ramanujan {{discovered}} mock theta functions. For many years these functions were a mystery, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak Maass forms.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications were {{included}} on the Antiquities List of 1925, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>now,</b> indeed, little {{nearer to}} {{capturing}} the castle than <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> before.|$|R

5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E
5|$|Cavaldi {{stays in}} the village and joins the villagers for the feast. Angelika kisses both the Grimms and tells them that they are always welcome at the village. The Brothers Grimm decide to pursue a new profession, presumably {{recording}} fairy tales, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> wanted criminals of the state. One of the Queen's crows is seen flying off with the last shard of her mirror, still holding the Queen's watchful eye and presumably, her living soul.|$|E
5|$|Dugongidae, unlike Trichechidae, is paraphyletic, {{comprising}} the Dugonginae and Hydrodamalinae (which are both monophyletic) and the paraphyletic Halitheriinae. The tusks of modern day dugongs may have originally {{have been used}} for digging, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> used for social interaction. The genus Dugong probably originated in the Indo-Pacific area.|$|E

5|$|First bred in 1795 in Hastings, East Sussex for {{specific}} hunting conditions, they nearly became extinct during the Second World War. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> more {{popular in the}} United States {{than any other country}} and are recognised by all major kennel clubs. Notably, a Sussex Spaniel won the best in show in 2009 at the 133rd Westminster Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, when India {{became a}} republic, Gurkhas {{serving in the}} Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army lost their {{eligibility}} for the Victoria Cross and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> covered under the separate Indian honours system. Under this system the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), which is India's highest military decoration for valour, {{is considered to be}} equivalent to the Victoria Cross. As such only those serving in the Gurkha units of the British Army remain eligible for the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Marmalard {{and other}} Omegas lure Otter to a motel {{and beat him}} up, believing that Otter is {{having an affair with}} Marmalard's girlfriend, Mandy. The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all, having already {{notified}} their local draft boards that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> eligible for military service. The news shocks Flounder so badly that he vomits on Wormer.|$|E

5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian is a {{versatile}} breed. Arabians dominate {{the discipline of}} endurance riding, and compete today in many other fields of equestrian sport. They {{are one of the}} top ten most popular horse breeds in the world. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> found worldwide, including the United States and Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, continental Europe, South America (especially Brazil), and their land of origin, the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} breed dog of the spaniel type. They were originally developed to be all-black show {{dogs in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog. However, during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable {{to be used for}} field work. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> considered to be a rare breed, and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, the Boers {{feared that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> {{vulnerable}} to being outflanked, and withdrew during the night.|$|R

5|$|The {{eggs were}} first named in 1994, {{when the two}} oospecies were {{classified}} in distinct oogenera as Cairanoolithus dughii and Dughioolithus roussetensis. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> considered to belong in a single oogenus, possibly even a single oospecies. Though it has been classified as a megaloolithid, Cairanoolithus is now placed in its own oofamily, Cairanoolithidae.|$|E
5|$|The {{house and}} {{ancillary}} structures are listed buildings that {{have now been}} converted into private residences. The original grounds are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England and now include St. Brendan's Sixth Form College, sports pitches and some farmland. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> included on the Heritage at Risk register.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> on display.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> given various {{tasks to}} learn {{becoming}} singers and performers, while {{competing for the}} grand prize.|$|R

5|$|At {{morning they}} find that three cairns have been built around their tent during the night, which unnerves them. As they continue, Heather realizes her map is missing and Mike later reveals he kicked it into a creek the {{previous}} day out of frustration, which prompts Heather and Josh to attack him in a rage. They realize <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> lost and decide simply to head south. They eventually reach a section where they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear sounds again, including the sound of children laughing among other strange noises. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{there were}} {{detailed}} contemporaneous histories on Caligula, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them {{are described as}} biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus {{was a friend of}} Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation. Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Wilhelmina (Vanessa Williams) is {{in a coma}} from being shot by Tyler (Neal Bledsoe). Claire Meade (Judith Light) is the only witness and a {{possible}} suspect. When she wakes up, she is visited by Connor Owens (Grant Bowler), who tells her that he cannot live without her. Upon leaving the hospital, Wilhelmina holds a press conference and tells the reporters that she shot herself accidentally. Claire thanks her for not mentioning Tyler and Wilhelmina tells her that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> good. Daniel later tells Wilhelmina that he is stepping down as editor of MODE and gives her his job.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> {{standing}} at his house-door, and a cheerful sound of voices and laughter was heard within.|$|R
