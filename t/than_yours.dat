The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote that: So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered <b>than</b> <b>yours,</b> for he separates the vile from the decent, and sequesters even from their fellow-retiarii the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, and even in gaol, such creatures herd apart….|$|E

500|$|Between 1797 and 1799 {{alongside}} {{the suppression of}} mutiny Jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of Gibraltar including building a new Victualling Yard and Water Tanks to replenish his ships. After the Battle of the Nile the dockyards, under Jervis' watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet. Lady Lavinia Bingham, wife of Earl Spencer wrote to St Vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for Nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the Nile. [...] "Never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward <b>than</b> <b>yours</b> has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend." [...] Nelson commented that he had [...] "never beheld a fleet equal to Sir John Jervis'" [...] Having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the Admiral arranged for large tanks {{to be built in}} Gibraltar. On 14 February 1799 St Vincent was created admiral of the white. Constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. Despite his failing health, St Vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the Board reluctant to supersede him. By 17 June 1799 {{he had no choice but}} to resign his command and return to England. During his time ashore the Earl lived in Rochetts, Essex with his wife.|$|E

2500|$|Days {{before the}} decree {{absolute}} of divorce, letters patent were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style Her Royal Highness {{because she was}} no longer married to the Prince of Wales and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: [...] "Don't worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you one day when I am King." [...] Almost a year before, according to Tina Brown, the Duke of Edinburgh had warned the Princess of Wales: [...] "If you don't behave, my girl, we'll take your title away." [...] She is said to have replied: [...] "My title is a lot older <b>than</b> <b>yours,</b> Philip." [...] Diana and her mother quarrelled in May 1997 after she told Hello! magazine that Diana was happy to lose her title of Her Royal Highness following her controversial divorce from Prince Charles. They were reportedly not on speaking terms with each other by the time of Diana's death.|$|E
