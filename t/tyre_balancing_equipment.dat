A {{series of}} organic-inorganic hybrids were {{developed}} via intercalation process of primary, secondary and tertiary ammonium cations into different alkali and alkaline earth and transition metal cation forms of bentonite clay {{to be used}} as adsorbent materials for CO 2 capture under ambient temperature and slightly high pressure.

40|$|An {{unbalance}} is {{the most}} common issue affecting the turbomachinery rotors. A machine operation at high vibration level due to the rotor disk unbalance will result in the damage to rotor bearings. The vibration level in industrial turbomachinery is hardly ever monitored in online systems to record all exceeded parameters. It is usually monitored in the key process machines. The operation of a supervision system will result in their deactivation at reaching the alarm threshold vibration level. The rotor disk is in almost all cases balanced in its own bearings supporting the shaft using the influence coefficient method. In some cases, the rotor disk is balanced in normal operation using automatic balancers. Although they do not solve the rotor unbalance issue, they reduce the vibration level at any given time. The main disadvantage of the system is its high price, often exceeding the costs of a new pump or fan. If technical conditions allow to stop the rotor for a short period, the disk can be balanced using manual balancers, with a significantly lower cost compared to the automatic <b>balancing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The operation of the manual balancing system is described herein...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{load and}} stress imposed from a {{connecting}} piping system can greatly affect {{the reliability of}} an equipment; these loads either from expansion of a pipe or from other source can cause shaft misalignment as well as shell deformation interfering with the internal moving parts. Therefore {{it is important to}} design the piping system to impose a little stress as possible on the equipment, ideally, it is not possible. This project work is focused on to stress analysis of a pump piping system as per process piping codes B 31. 3 by CAESAR-II and rethinking the nozzle allowable loads provided by the pump manufacture, to optimize the design and reduced the design, material as well as manufacturing cost. To achieve this, implement various methods. The loads which are imposed on the pump nozzle can be reduced by possible re-routing the piping system with less modification. But this re-routing of a piping has its practical & layout limitation, so as to overcome this difficulty, explores the methods for setting a higher allowable loads without changing pump manufacturer design consideration and size of pump. A more realistic allowable should be established as per API 610 standard to better <b>balance</b> <b>equipment</b> cost against piping engineering. I...|$|R

The SLE recommendations define protocols for extending the space link from ground terminals to other facilities deeper within a ground network, allowing distributed access to space link telecommand and telemetry services. The SLE protocols are widely used to provide cross support between sites, programs, and agencies. In traditional SLE deployments, individual service instances have been manually provisioned well in advance of the commencement of cross support for a particular mission, and hardware and software resources have been allocated to those service instances at the time of provisioning. While valid, this approach requires that dedicated resources be provided for each mission and service instance, and limits an SLE provider's ability to reallocate resources in real time based on system availability or other factors. This paper discusses an alternative approach to SLE service provisioning, in which individual service instances are assigned resources from a common resource pool at the time that each service instance is initialized.

40|$|An {{integrated}} microalgal biorefinery {{is desirable}} {{from an economic}} standpoint but challenging to synthesize, due to diversity of options. This work uses a model-based optimization approach to address this challenge in a systematic manner. A superstructure of the integrated biorefinery is developed where biodiesel is considered as the main product, while polar lipid, protein, and carbohydrate are also processed to various value-added compounds. Mass <b>balances,</b> <b>equipment</b> capacity limitations, and cost functions corresponding to these processes constitute {{the constraints of the}} optimization problem. The decision variables include the process synthesis as well as process scheduling and operations-related decisions. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was developed to minimize the net annualized life cycle cost (ALCC) of the biorefinery. For a scenario of 30 Mg/d production target of biodiesel, with no intermediate storage between the stages, the superstructure yielded an optimal biodiesel production cost of US$ 8. 53 /L and reduced sugar was selected as a co-product. Several cases were analyzed in terms of the decision making of the process on the upstream and downstream levels, as well as variations in scheduling strategies. Co-cultivation of the phototrophic and heterotrophic strains resulted in net ALCC of US$ 7. 66 /L, which was 10. 2 % less than the base case.

This five-month study {{investigated}} the effects {{of different types of}} movement programming and class size upon the in-tune singing and memory for melodic phrases of 25 learning disabled students, 6 to 11 years old, enrolled in a suburban elementary public school. Music classroom behaviors (singing participation, auditory discrimination for music sounds, motor skills, overall attending and self-confidence) were rated by a trained observer during all treatment sessions. The influence of balance-related activities upon on-task behaviors and music-related motor skills was also addressed. Subjects were pre- and post-tested on reading skills and auditory memory for words. Data were gathered {{through the use of a}} constructed music test, standardized tests, daily observation charts, and anecdotal records. Posttreatment student feedback was tape-recorded. Results indicated significant improvement for all self-contained music class groups in the areas of intune singing and memory for melodic phrases; subjects in the mainstreamed music classes realized losses in both areas.
