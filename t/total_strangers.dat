25|$|Episodes {{revolve around}} the adventures of Sarah and her friends in Valley Village, California, a {{district}} in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles, which is portrayed as an autonomous city within the show. Silverman plays a fictionalized version of herself, an unemployed woman who leads an irresponsible life. Her most notable trait is her undiluted, childlike self-absorption, which commonly leads to awkward comedic situations in which she insults friends, family, and <b>total</b> <b>strangers.</b> The show tackled issues such as abortion, racism, and same-sex marriage; it was canceled after three seasons. The show was filmed at Hollywood Center Studios, Hollywood, California.|$|E

500|$|When {{she passed}} her driving test, Lennon {{serially}} {{bought her a}} white Mini, a gold Porsche, a red Ferrari, and a green Volkswagen Beetle, usually as surprises without consulting her first. Cynthia enjoyed the closeness of Pattie Boyd (George Harrison's wife) and Maureen Starkey (Ringo Starr's wife), as both lived nearby, often going on holiday together or shopping. She was often photographed at Beatles' movie premieres and special occasions, and sometimes with Lennon and Julian at home, which meant she had {{the role of a}} Beatle wife, as well as being a mother. The Lennons often went to a nightclub in central London until nearly dawn, after which she took Julian to school. [...] Kenwood became the place to visit for the other Beatles, various American musicians, and <b>total</b> <b>strangers</b> who Lennon had met the previous night in London nightclubs.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{initiative}} was usually the husband's, the wife {{had to agree}} to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that [...] "after several biddings she [...] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and a quart of ale". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from <b>total</b> <b>strangers.</b> In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife [...] "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, the man asked his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth.|$|E

2500|$|The film's poster, {{featuring}} the five characters huddled together, was photographed by Annie Leibovitz {{toward the end}} of shooting.

She disagreed with the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling, stating there was no right to sodomy written in the Constitution and that under federalism each individual state and territory would have to repeal their sodomy laws. She stated she opposed banning same-sex sexual intercourse. She also stated that same-sex sexual intercourse was already protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prevents police from going into your home without a search warrant or court order.|$|E

2500|$|Elaine Benes [...] (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) – Elaine is Jerry's ex-girlfriend {{and later}} friend. She is {{attractive}} and genial, while also being humorous, arrogant and occasionally impulsive. She sometimes {{has a tendency}} to be too honest with people (usually by losing her temper), which often gets her into trouble. She usually gets caught up in her boyfriends' quirks, eccentric employers' unusual behaviors and idiosyncrasies, and the maladjustment of <b>total</b> <b>strangers.</b> She tends to make poor choices in men she chooses to date and is often overly reactionary. First she works at Pendant Publishing with Mr. Lippman, is later hired as a personal assistant for Mr. Pitt, and later works for the J. Peterman catalogue as a glorified assistant. Elaine is popularly described as an amalgamation of David's and Seinfeld's girlfriends during their early days in New York as struggling comedians.|$|E
2500|$|All these rituals are {{symbolic}} of one's development. Before each is performed, the individual spends time with community elders {{to prepare for}} the next stage. The elders' teachings are not written, but transmitted from generation to generation by oral tradition. The iziduko (clan) for instance—which matters most to the Xhosa identity (even more than names and surnames) are transferred {{from one to the other}} through oral tradition. Knowing your isiduko is vital to the Xhosas and it is considered a shame and uburhanuka (lack-of-identity) if one doesn’t know one's clan. This is considered so important that when two strangers meet for the first time, the first identity that gets shared is isiduko. It is so important that two people with the same surname but different clan are considered <b>total</b> <b>strangers</b> but the same two people from the same clan but different surnames are regarded as close relatives. This forms the roots of ubuntu (human kindness) – a behaviour synonymous to this tribe as extending a helping hand to a complete stranger when in need. Ubuntu goes further than just helping one another – it is so deep that it even extends to looking after and reprimanding your neighbour's child when in the wrong. Hence the saying [...] "it takes a village to raise a child".|$|E
2500|$|Irish Wolfhounds have {{a varied}} range of {{personal}}ities and {{are most often}} noted for their personal quirks and individualism. An Irish Wolfhound, however, is rarely mindless, and despite its large size is rarely found to be destructive in the house or boisterous. This is because the breed is generally introverted, intelligent, and reserved in character. An easygoing animal, the Irish Wolfhound is quiet by nature. Wolfhounds often create a strong bond with their family and can become quite destructive or morose if left alone {{for long periods of}} time. An Irish Wolfhound is not a guard dog and will protect individuals rather than the house or the owner’s possessions. However independent the wolfhound is, the breed becomes attached to both owners and other dogs they are raised with and is therefore not the most adaptable of breeds. Bred for independence, an Irish Wolfhound is not necessarily keen on defending spaces. A wolfhound is most easily described by its historical motto, “gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked”. [...] Despite the need for their own people, Wolfhounds generally are somewhat stand-offish with <b>total</b> <b>strangers.</b> They should not be territorially aggressive to other domestic dogs but are born with specialized skills and it is common for hounds at play to course another dog. This is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior. Most Wolfhounds are very gentle with children. The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train. They respond well to firm, but gentle, consistent leadership. However, historically these dogs were required to work at great distances from their masters and think independently when hunting rather than waiting for detailed commands and this can still be seen in the breed.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{frequency}} and negative consequences of stranger harassment, only a scant {{number of studies have}} explicitly examined stranger harassment and its consequences through the lens of objectification theory. The current study introduced and tested a mediation model in which women’s experiences of stranger harassment may lead to self-objectification, which in turn may lead to objectification of other people. To examine this model, undergraduate women (N = 501) completed measures of stranger harassment (including the verbal harassment and sexual pressure subscales of the Stranger Harassment Index), body surveillance, and objectification of other women and men. Consistent with hypotheses, significant positive correlations emerged among <b>total</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment, verbal harassment, sexual pressure, body surveillance, and other objectification of women. Other-objectification of men showed a similar pattern of results, with the exception of being unrelated to <b>total</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment and sexual pressure. Consistent with the proposed model, body surveillance was a significant mediator of the relation between <b>total</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment and other-objectification of both women and men, as well as the relation between verbal harassment and other-objectification of both women and men. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as future directions for research on stranger harassment, are discussed...|$|R
