We study {{unification}} {{and matching}} in equational theories based on semirings, which include Kleene algebra and extensions with {{different forms of}} concurrency, constraint semirings, and synchronous ac-tions algebra. Generally the unification problems are undecidable in this setting, but different undecidability proofs are required. On the other hand, the matching problems are decidable and a general pattern can be drawn. This pattern is developed into a matching algorithm, relying on {{a new way of}} combining non-disjoint theories, which we call stratification, and on a relaxation of the finite variant property, which we call separa-bility. Consequently, <b>we</b> believe <b>that</b> our algorithm and <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> introduce have an importance i) beyond theories based on semirings; ii) for other problems related to unification and matching. ...|$|R

Sir John Cam Hobhouse wrote his thoughts down in his diary: [...] "In spite of the allusions to the creative will of God the cosmogony is atheistic—at least the introduction of an author of all things seems very like a formality for the sake of saving appearances—it is not a necessary part of the scheme". While disquieted by its information on embryology implying human origins from animals, he thought its tone was good. He concluded that [...] "It does not meddle with revealed religion—but unless I am mistaken the leaders of revealed religion will meddle with it." [...] Lord Morpeth thought it had [...] "much that is able, startling, striking" [...] and progressive development did not conflict with Genesis more than then current geology, but did [...] "not care much for <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are engendered by monkeys" [...] and objected strongly to the idea that the Earth was [...] "a member of a democracy" [...] of similar planets.|$|E
2500|$|In Aupers and Houtman (2010) Bovbjerg {{identifies}} NLP as a New Age [...] "psycho-religion" [...] {{and uses}} NLP as a case-study {{to demonstrate the}} thesis that the New Age psycho-religions such as NLP are predicated on an instrinsically religious idea, namely concern with a transcendent [...] "other". In the world's monotheistic faiths, argues Bovbjerg, the purpose of religious practice is communion and fellowship with a [...] transcendent 'other', i.e. a God. [...] With the New Age psycho-religions, argues Bovbjerg, this orientation towards a transcendent 'other' persists but the other has become [...] "the other in our selves", the so-called unconscious: [...] "he individual's inner life becomes the intangible focus of religious practices and the subconscious becomes a constituent part of modern individuals' understanding of the Self." [...] Bovbjerg adds, [...] "ourses in personal development would make no sense without an unconscious that contains hidden resources and hidden knowledge of the self." [...] Thus psycho-religious practice revolves around ideas of the conscious and unconscious self and communicating with and accessing the hidden resources of the unconscious self—the transcendent other. According to Bovbjerg <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have an unconscious self underlies many NLP techniques either explicitly or implicitly. Bovbjerg argues, [...] "hrough particular practices, the [...] psycho-religious practitioner expects to achieve self-perfection in a never-ending transformation of the self." ...|$|E
2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another. He rejects {{the notion that}} any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of {{some sense of the}} power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action).

40|$|For {{many years}} in the 20 th Century, Western {{thinking}} in education has been defined against the background of Cartesian dualisms, both with respect to philosophy and methodology.

60|$|To summarise; before {{touching}} the philosophy which Shaw has ultimately adopted, we must quit <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know it already {{and that it}} is hit off in such journalistic terms as these three. Shaw does not wish to multiply problem plays or even problems. He has such scepticism as is the misfortune of his age; but he has this dignified and courageous quality, that he does not come to ask questions but to answer them. He is not a paradox-monger; he is a wild logician, far too simple even to be called a sophist. He understands everything in life except its paradoxes, especially that ultimate paradox that the very things that we cannot comprehend are {{the things that we have}} to take for granted. Lastly, he is not especially social or collectivist. On the contrary, he rather dislikes men in the mass, though he can appreciate them individually. He has no respect for collective humanity in its two great forms; either in that momentary form which we call a mob, or in that enduring form which we call a convention.|$|E

6000|$|The {{followers}} of the Father Christian Rosencrux, says the old tradition, wrapped his imperishable body in noble raiment and laid it under the house of their order, in a tomb containing the symbols of all things in heaven and earth, and in the waters under the earth, and set about him inextinguishable magical lamps, which burnt on generation after generation, until other students of the order came upon the tomb by chance. It {{seems to me that}} the imagination has had no very different history during the last two hundred years, but has been laid in a great tomb of criticism, and had set over it inextinguishable magical lamps of wisdom and romance, and has been altogether so nobly housed and apparelled that we have forgotten that its wizard lips are closed, or but opened for the complaining of some melancholy and ghostly voice. The ancients and the Elizabethans abandoned themselves to imagination as a woman abandons herself to love, and created great beings who made the people of this world seem but shadows, and great passions which made our loves and hatreds appear but ephemeral and trivial phantasies; but now it is not the great persons, or the great passions we imagine, which absorb us, for the persons and passions in our poems are mainly reflections our mirror has caught from older poems or from the life about us, but the wise comments we make upon them, the criticism of life we wring from their fortunes. Arthur and his Court are nothing, but the many-coloured lights that play about them are as beautiful as the lights from cathedral windows; Pompilia and Guido are but little, while the ever-recurring meditations and expositions which climax in the mouth of the Pope are among the wisest of the Christian age. I cannot get it out of my mind that this age of criticism is about to pass, and an age of imagination, of emotion, of moods, of revelation, about to come in its place; for certainly belief in a supersensual world is at hand again; and when <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are 'phantoms of the earth and water' has gone down the wind, we will trust our own being and all it desires to invent; and when the external world is no more the standard of reality, we will learn again that the great Passions are angels of God, and that to embody them 'uncurbed in their eternal glory,' even in their labour for the ending of man's peace and prosperity, is more than to comment, however wisely, upon the tendencies of our time, or to express the socialistic, or humanitarian, or other forces of our time, or even 'to sum up' our time, as the phrase is; for Art is a revelation, and not a criticism, and the life of the artist is in the old saying, 'The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the spirit.' ...|$|E

[...] This is the more remarkable because Mr. Gladstone has done less to [...] lay down any systematised course of action than almost any man of [...] his political standing, has a cautiousness of speech which [...] frequently puzzles his audience even while they are cheering his [...] oratory, and perceives alternatives with a clearness which often [...] leaves on his own advice an impression of indecision....

They believe, with certain [...] misgivings, that he can offer them a new and more satisfactory [...] system of foreign policy; and, with no misgivings, that he will [...] break up the torpor which has fallen upon internal affairs. Mr. [...] Gladstone, say his admirers, may be too much afraid of war, too [...] zealous for economy, too certain of the status of England as a [...] fact altogether independent of her action. But he is sure to [...] abandon those traditional ideas to which we have adhered so long: [...] <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are a continental people, bound to maintain the [...] continental system, interested in petty matters of boundary, [...] concerned to dictate to Germany whether she shall be united or [...] not, to the Christians of Servia whether they shall rebel against [...] the Turk or obey him, to everybody whether they shall or shall not [...] develop themselves as they can. He is sure to initiate that [...] temporary policy of abstention which is needed to make a breach in [...] the great chain of English traditions, and enable the nation to [...] act as its interests or duties or dignity may require, without [...] reference to the mode in which it has acted heretofore. Mr. [...] Gladstone, for example, certainly would not support the Turk as if [...] Turkish sway were a moral law, would not trouble himself to [...] interfere with the project for cutting an Eider Canal, would not [...] from very haughtiness of temperament protest in the face of Europe [...] unless he intended his protests to be followed by some form of [...] action.... That impression may be true or it may be false, but it [...] exists; it is justified in part by Mr. Gladstone’s recent [...] speeches, and it indicates a very noteworthy change in the [...] disposition of the public mind: a weariness of the line of action [...] called “a spirited foreign policy.” ... The expectation as to [...] internal affairs is far more definite and more strong.... All his [...] speeches point to the inauguration of a new activity in all [...] internal affairs, to a steady determination to improve, if [...] possible, both the constitution and the condition of the millions [...] who have to live under it. Most ministers have that idea in their [...] heads, but Mr. Gladstone has more than the idea, he has plans, and [...] the courage to propose and maintain them. He is not afraid of the [...] suffrage, as he indicated in his celebrated speech; he is not [...] alarmed at risking the treasury as his reductions have proved; [...] does not hesitate to apply the full power of the state to [...] ameliorate social anomalies, as he showed by creating state banks, [...] state insurance offices, and state annuity funds for the very [...] poor.

Recently there has been a wave of refugees towards European countries, which has resulted in many asylum seekers. Many refugees have risked their lives to travel across the Mediterranean Sea for a better life. They have sought towards democratic countries, because of their perception of democracy. There are many definitions of democracy, that have been developed by theorists such as Robert A. Dahl, Platon and Hal Koch. Therefore, we have chosen three <b>notions</b> to examine <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of democracy. <b>The</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have chosen are freedom, safety and the intentions regarding the future. To do so we have selected methods and analytic models, such as the qualitative methods, interview, hermeneutics and abduction, that have provided this project report with {{a better understanding of the}} definition of democracy. The analysis focuses on the asylum seeker’s experiences and what they associate with democracy based on those three notions. Our literature has also helped us in obtaining a profound understanding of the theorists’ definitions of the phenomenon, democracy. The literature has been in the form of books, websites etc. After a discussion based on our analysis, the project report concludes that asylum seekers view on democracy is indeed idealistic and positive, because their rights had been oppressed previously by the regime in their country.
