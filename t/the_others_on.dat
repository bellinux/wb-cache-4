Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E

5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since {{there seemed to be no}} official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, a workers' tent {{camp was}} erected {{on the eastern}} side of Stirling Ridge to house the men working on the main intercepting sewer. The {{following}} year saw the start of the construction of 62 small, four-room, unlined timber cottages, to be used as housing for the married tradesmen involved {{in the construction of the}} provisional Parliament House. Other camps were established at the eastern end of Stirling Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie's settlement (1922–30), consisting of 25 timber cottages for his married men and timber barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single men's tent camps were established nearby—Old Tradesmen's Camp (1923–27) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924–27). The men from Howie's worked on the Hotel Canberra and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> the construction of the provisional Parliament House and nearby administrative buildings.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E

25|$|With an {{eye toward}} self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the {{contributions}} of his collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation, are {{largely responsible for the}} final form of the bridge.

Only much later were the contributions of <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> the design team properly appreciated.
