30|$|<b>The</b> <b>relief</b> {{ratio is}} defined as the ratio of maximum relief to {{horizontal}} distance along the longest dimension of the basin parallel to the principal drainage line (Schumm 1956). <b>The</b> <b>relief</b> ratio is generally increases with decreasing drainage area and size of the watershed in a given basin. There is a big correlation between hydrological characteristics and <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> ratio of <b>the</b> drainage basin (Ahmed et al. 2010).

40|$|Relief valves {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} machinery. Due to the outlet of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve being connected to the tank, the pressure drop of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve is frequently equal to the inlet pressure. Accordingly, the energy loss of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve is very high in some cases and this will worsen {{with an increase in}} the rated pressure of the hydraulic system. In order to overcome the disadvantage of overflow energy loss in a relief valve, a hydraulic energy regeneration unit (HERU) is connected to the outlet of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve to decrease the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve. <b>The</b> overflow loss, which is characterized by the pressure drop, can be reduced accordingly. The approach is to convert the overflow energy loss in hydraulic form and allow for release when needed. The configuration and working principle of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve with HERU is introduced in this present study. The mathematical model is established to obtain the factors influencing the stability of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve. <b>The</b> working pressure of the hydraulic accumulator (HA) is explored. Furthermore, the control process of the operating state of the HA is scheduled to decide whether to regenerate the energy via the HERU. The software AMESim is utilized to analyze the performance and characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve with HERU. Following this, the test rig is built and used to verify the effectiveness of <b>the</b> proposed <b>relief</b> valve with HERU. The experimental results show that <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve with <b>the</b> HERU connected to its outlet can still achieve better pressure-regulating characteristics. The energy regeneration efficiency saved by the HA is up to 83. 6 %, with a higher pre-charge pressure of the HA. This indicates that the proposed structure of <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> valve with HERU can achieve a better performance and higher regeneration efficiency...|$|R
