40|$|Abstract — <b>Time</b> <b>overruns</b> and Cost overruns {{has been}} a major issue in many Indian {{construction}} projects. The successful execution of construction projects and keeping them within prescribed schedule and cost is very important for effective time performance and cost performance. This research work is carried out on studying significant factors causing <b>Time</b> <b>overruns</b> and Cost overruns in Indian construction projects. A valid questionnaire for the survey was developed based on factors for <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> and factors for cost overruns identified from literature review. These factors are grouped into 12 categories for <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> and 8 categories for cost overruns and distributed to Contractors, Consultants, and Owners of Indian construction Industry. The data from the questionnaire was analyzed statistically. Relative important index method was used to found out the most significant factors affecting <b>Time</b> and Cost <b>overruns.</b> The result accomplished from the survey revealed that the major cause for <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> are material market rate, contract modification, and high level of quality requirement and the major cause for cost overruns are high transportation cost, change in material specification, and escalation of materials price.

40|$|Construction {{projects}} have a worldwide history of being completed beyond their schedule durations. Road construction {{is not an}} exception, as such client organisations end up paying huge sums of money in compensations for delayed projects while contractors {{on the other hand}} suffer losses from delayed projects. The study aims at identifying causes, effects and measures for minimising <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> in road construction projects in Malawi. A detailed literature review and structured questionnaire surveys were used for the study; and results revealed the presence of <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> in road construction projects in Malawi. Results of the study have revealed that inadequate planning, inability to pre-finance projects, delays in processing contractors’ payments, delayed mobilisation to project sites, slow decision making, delayed approvals for scope changes, workers risky behaviours, poor planning and scheduling, price fluctuations, political interference, equipment unavailability, inclement weather as causes of <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> in projects. <b>Time</b> <b>overruns</b> in road {{projects have}} cost <b>overruns,</b> extension of <b>time,</b> claims, disputes, contract termination, loss of profits, project abandonment, poor quality of work due to hurried execution, idling of resources, bankruptcy, arbitration, litigation and loss of employees as their effects. The study has established the following measures which when effectively implemented will minimise <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> in road construction projects: proper project planning and scheduling, effective and efficient management of sites and supervision services, availability of complete designs at project commencement, coordination on site, adherence to specification, use of appropriate construction methods; use of proper and modern equipment, conducting frequent progress meetings, construction according to drawings and use of up to date technology. As a way of mitigating <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> in road construction projects in Malawi, the study recommends the following: ensuring secure and reliable funding for the entire project duration; availability of complete designs at project commencement; awarding contracts to technically and financially sound contractors; ensure availability by revamping activities of PVHO; implementation of measures which will counter the occurrence of <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> in projects; and holding of frequent progress site meetings...|$|R

Problem statement Many construction projects suffer from cost and or <b>time</b> <b>overruns.</b> A lot of research has been done into causes of these overruns. In order to prevent overruns, an early warning is needed by an early recognition. When indicators with a predictive value for cost and <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> are known, a steering or intervention method can be used to reduce or prevent the overrun. This research will reveal these indicators. Objective By revealing indicators, steering and intervention methods, {{it might be possible to}} respond to possible cost and <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> in an early phase. Next to that, a look has been taken into which party should have the responsibility of recognising and responding to these indicators and in which phase the indicator should be taken into account. By also taking a look at possible contracttypes, the amount of information that is shared between parties during a construction project, the party which is currently harmed most and the role of the projectmanager, these themes and their relation with cost and <b>time</b> <b>overruns</b> have also been researched. The result of the research can be used at the beginning and during construction projects by all the parties that are involved. Research method A literature research has been done into causes of cost and <b>time</b> <b>overruns.</b> Interviews have been done with different types of parties involved in construction projects who have experience with overruns. Based on their experience with projects, indicators and related themes have been discussed.

In an attempt to reverse this trend, this study aims at establishing the relationship between <b>time</b> <b>overrun</b> and labour productivity on construction sites in Lagos, Nigeria. 43 technical and management staff of some medium and large construction firms based in Lagos, Nigeria were sampled and administered a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire contained 18 causes of project <b>time</b> <b>overrun</b> and 14 causes of low labour productivity which had been identified from the literature reviewed. With these a relationship between project <b>time</b> <b>overrun</b> and low labour productivity was established. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used in analyzing the data.

40|$|Malaysia is a fast {{developing}} {{country in the}} Asian region which has undergone rapid growth since the 1970 s. The construction industry is an important sector in socialeconomic development. It is generally understood that construction project delivery in Malaysia frequently experiences cost and time overruns, leading to many being completed at excessive cost and <b>time</b> <b>overrun,</b> or, in some situations, abandoned. The overall aim of the study, therefore, {{was to develop a}} framework to proactively minimise <b>time</b> <b>overrun</b> in Malaysian construction projects. This aim was fulfilled by achieving research objectives, including an investigation of the factors that contribute to time overruns, the relationship between the time and cost of construction projects, and to compare the factors related to <b>time</b> <b>overrun</b> in the 'best' and 'worst' Malaysian construction projects. A four-stage approach was adopted for the study. The quantitative data sets obtained were subjected to a rigorous statistical analysis. The main limitation of this research was due to a low response rate from the respondents. The personal contact with the respondents was used to'increase the response rate in all questionnaire surveys. The study concluded {{that there is a need}} to develop a framework for minimising <b>time</b> <b>overrun</b> in Malaysian construction projects. The results from the four stages were found suitable for further use in framework development. From the 84 <b>time</b> <b>overrun</b> factors investigated, 37 significant factors were determined, which were focused on for framework development. The research proceeded to develop a comprehensive framework to minimise <b>time</b> <b>overrun,</b> followed by several mitigation measures being suggested for each of the factors. The use of professionals and experts in the construction industry helped to identify the effectiveness and practicality of the mitigation measures for each factor. The framework came together with the risk management strategy for a construction project. It is anticipated that the framework will encourage the construction industry to understand the importance of minimising <b>time</b> <b>overrun,</b> as well as assisting and enabling the clients, consultants, contractors and others parties involved in construction projects. It is hoped that this will lead to future improvements in the Malaysian construction industry, through a continuous culture of improvement in the industry, and act as a vehicle for change within the industry, which is required to assist in improving current standard practices in delivering construction projects of better quality that fulfill client satisfaction and minimise <b>time</b> <b>overrun.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
