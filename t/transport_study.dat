5|$|Dunstan {{wasted no}} time in organising his new ministry, taking several {{portfolios}} for himself, and again taking the position of Treasurer of South Australia. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide <b>Transport</b> <b>Study</b> (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.|$|E

It is a matter of debate whether Beeching left by mutual arrangement with the government or if he was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the House of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom Fraser. Beeching denied this, pointing out that he had returned early to ICI as he would not have had enough time to undertake an in-depth <b>transport</b> <b>study</b> before the formal end of his secondment.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 the 'M.A.T.S.' plan (Metropolitan Adelaide <b>Transport</b> <b>Study)</b> was {{commissioned}} by the Government of South Australia. It examined establishing a large network of highways along Adelaide's main urban transport corridors. The plan {{went as far as}} the State Government of the day purchasing land along Adelaide's major roads, in preparation for highway construction. However, later State Governments abandoned the plan during the 1970s. The consequences of the political rejection of this plan are now being realised as increased traffic has caused travel times to increase, and congestion on main thoroughfares such as South Road has become a daily reality.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, a Metropolitan Adelaide <b>Transport</b> <b>Study</b> Plan was {{proposed}} {{in order to}} cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, expressways and the upgrade of {{certain aspects of the}} public transport system. The then premier Steele Hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later Labor government elected under Don Dunstan shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the Liberal party won government and premier David Tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.|$|E

500|$|The {{system was}} closed during World WarII. [...] By the war's end, the tram network was {{damaged beyond repair}} amid a city that lay in ruins. [...] It was {{dismantled}} and jeepneys became the city's primary form of transportation, plying the routes once served by the tram lines. [...] With the return of buses and cars to the streets, traffic congestion became a problem. [...] In 1966, the Philippine government granted a franchise to Philippine Monorail Transport Systems (PMTS) for the operation of an inner-city monorail. [...] The monorail's feasibility was still being evaluated when the government asked the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to conduct a separate <b>transport</b> <b>study.</b> [...] Prepared between 1971 and 1973, the JICA study proposed a series of circumferential and radial roads, an inner-city rapid transit system, a commuter railway, and an expressway with three branches. [...] After further examination, many recommendations were adopted; however, none of them involved rapid transit and the monorail was never built. [...] PMTS' franchise subsequently expired in 1974.|$|E

The airport is signposted from the M5, from junction 22 when approaching from the south and junction 18 when approaching from the north. Neither gives quick access to the airport, a fact which was recognised by the Greater Bristol Strategic <b>Transport</b> <b>Study.</b> In November 2013, Bristol and North Somerset councils approved a planning application for the South Bristol Link Road. This provides a link from the A38 northwards to the A370 at Long Ashton, giving the airport an improved connection to the M5, and a link from the A38 southwards to Hengrove Park, connecting to the Bristol Ring Road. The South Bristol Link, part of the MetroBus rapid transit route, was opened in January 2017 and is expected to provide a reduction in journey times to the airport for both bus passengers and car drivers.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} fundamental {{questions concerning the}} origins and evolution of academic <b>transport</b> <b>studies</b> and the dynamics of its historical development. These fundamental questions are generally little discussed, yet are vital in gaining {{a better understanding of}} how the subject is driven forward. This article therefore attempts to answer these questions by taking the UK as a case study, with the principal method being evidence from semi-structured interviews with 20 senior figures integrally involved in the development of the subject. The characterization of <b>transport</b> <b>studies</b> provided by Allsop is employed as an analytical framework, enabling the construction of a historical narrative that can provide salient insights. Thus, it is argued that for academic <b>transport</b> <b>studies</b> the degree of early cross-fertilization with public arenas has meant that subsequent developments have been shaped by the subject's contextual environment. Most prominent among these developments has been the trend towards wider disciplinary breadth. This {{article examines}} the evolution of these processes, while the concluding section discusses their implications for consequent strengths and limitations of the subject. <br/...|$|R

2500|$|As well as {{improvements}} to public transport, the 2005 Greater Bristol Strategic <b>Transport</b> <b>Study,</b> {{commissioned by the}} regional government office, recommended road building to tackle congestion. [...] These include re-routing and extended the South Bristol Ring Road. [...] The road is currently partially single carriageway and indirect, terminating at the A38 in a built-up area. [...] When the current sections of the road were built it was intended that the road would continue as dual carriageway to {{a section of the}} A38 further south, and development prevented on the intended route. [...] The proposals follow this route west from Hengrove Park roundabout to the A38 at Castle Farm (phase 1), and from there to the A370 near Long Ashton Park and Ride (phase 2). [...] There are additional recommendations (phase 3) for a new Whitchurch bypass from Hengrove Park roundabout, along the base of Dundry Hill, around Stockwood and joining the existing A4174 at Hicks Gate roundabout on the A4. Phase one and two of the ring road are the only major road building schemes adopted by the Joint Local Transport Plan, which claimed they would reduce delays across the Greater Bristol area by 6%, and lead to a 9% increase in public transport use. Bristol City Council has since endorsed all three phases, hoping to begin construction of the first two phases in 2010 and 2011, and the third phase potentially some time after 2016.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} other major road {{developments}} {{proposed by the}} Strategic <b>Transport</b> <b>Study.</b> Emersons Green, a rapidly expanding business and industrial suburb with a £300 million [...] "science park" [...] currently in development, could {{be connected to the}} M4, with a new junction where the motorway crosses the dismantled Midlands railway (ST689779) and a new road following the route of the railway to the A4174 roundabout (ST675771). [...] When St Philip's Causeway was built by Bristol Development Corporation in the 1980s, connecting the M32 in St Pauls to the A4 at Arno's Vale, it was originally intended {{to be part of a}} larger road scheme. A proposed Callington Road Link would extend the road along the route of the dismantled Radstock railway line to the A4174, with a junction on the A4. Bristol Airport has also been attracting increasing levels of transport to roads south of Bristol, and an Airport link has been discussed for several years. [...] Two schemes are suggested in the STS, both entirely new roads. [...] One route connects Junction 20 of the M5 at Clevedon to the west end of the Long Ashton bypass as a new [...] "Nailsea Bypass", coupled with an [...] "Orange Route" [...] link from the Long Ashton bypass, approximately one kilometre from its west end, to the A38 at the B3130 junction. [...] The other route would run from the A38 just south of the airport, north of Wrington and south of Congresbury to the M5 at Weston-super-Mare. [...] The final major project proposal is a second Avonmouth Bridge. [...] This would be a lower level to the M5 bridge, with a swing or lifting mechanism, to the West of the existing bridge, and would relieve the motorway of the local traffic it carries.|$|E
