The survey was conducted over a 25 x 6 km area with ground height variation from 1, 800 masl to 3, 400 masl. The resolution of survey points on the ground varied from 1 per sq metre to around 1 per 4 sq metres, depending on elevation. Correspondence from swath <b>to</b> <b>swath</b> is very good despite the extreme nature of the topography & individual ground laser heights are accurate to within 20 cm.

40|$|A {{motion study}} is {{conducted}} on the SLICE Advanced Technology Demonstration vessel utilizing an existing software code. The SLICE concept is an advancement of conventional small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) design, conceived by the Lockheed Missile and Space Company of Sunnyvale, California. The SLICE is a multiple mission capable vessel due to the modular payload design. The weight report for the ferry application is used to construct a weight curve for input into the modeling program. The motions of surge, heave, sway, pitch, roll, and yaw are analyzed and discussed for excitations in regular and irregular waves; covering sea state one through seven. General seakeeping criteria are applied to rate {{the performance of the}} SLICE. The results of this study indicate the SLICE to be within the given criteria in seas up through sea state four provided, active/passive control surfaces can reduce vertical plane motions common <b>to</b> <b>SWATH</b> vessels.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a first application-oriented analysis of MERIS products for Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Chlorophyll-a (CHL) concentration in Belgian coastal waters. Regional algorithms designed for Belgian waters {{have been implemented}} and compared with the standard MERIS products, termed Total Suspended Matter and Algal 2 respectively. The standard and regional SPM products seem robust and give similar data. Notwithstanding a more complete match-up validation analysis, these products seem sufficiently mature for use in applications such as sediment transport model validation. Results for CHL products are less convincing and further analysis is required before this data can be reliably used. In particular the MERIS Product Confidence flags {{have not yet been}} validated. The red and near infrared bands are particularly important in turbid coastal waters and should be considered a priority for further validation. MERIS full resolution mode is attractive for SPM mapping when compared with other sensors. For CHL mapping in coastal waters the superior spectral resolution and algorithm design give MERIS a distinct advantage over other ocean colour sensors. The disadvantages of MERIS, particularly for SPM mapping, are the reduced frequency (related <b>to</b> <b>swath</b> and sunglint) and availability of data...|$|E
40|$|Forensic and {{clinical}} toxicological screening procedures {{are more and}} more employing LC-MS/MS techniques with information dependent acquisition (IDA) approaches. It is known that complexity of sample and settings of IDA might prevent important compounds from being triggered. Therefore, data independent acquisition methods (DIA) should be more suitable for systematic toxicological analysis (STA). The DIA method sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (SWATH) which uses Q 1 windows of 20 - 35 Da for data independent fragmentation, was systematically investigated for its suitability for STA. Quality of SWATH generated mass spectra were evaluated with regard to mass error, relative abundance of the fragments and library hits. With the Q 1 window set to 20 - 25 Da, several precursors pass Q 1 {{at the same time and}} are fragmented thus impairing the library search algorithms to a different extent: forward fit was less affected than reverse fit and purity fit. Mass error was not affected. Relative abundance of the fragments was concentration dependent for some analytes and was influenced by co-fragmentation, especially of deuterated analogues. Also the detection rate of IDA compared <b>to</b> <b>SWATH</b> was investigated in a forced coelution experiment (up to 20 analytes coeluting). Even using several different IDA settings it was observed that IDA failed to trigger relevant compounds. Screening results of 382 authentic forensic cases revealed that SWATH’s detection rate was superior to IDA, which failed to trigger about 10 % of the analytes...|$|E

40|$|For traffic {{monitoring}} applications using multi-channel {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) systems operating on air- or spaceborne platforms the vehicles moving on ground have to be detected and their motion parameters have to be estimated. Up to now, with DLR’s airborne F-SAR system {{as well as with}} the spaceborne TerraSAR-X Dual receive antenna mode only two channels of an along-track array have been combined coherently for purposes of ground moving target indication (GMTI) using techniques such as displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) and along-track interferometry (ATI). This work steps from target motion parameter estimation using two-channel techniques (ATI) to multi-channel STAP techniques. The drawback of two-channel target motion parameter estimation techniques such as ATI is that they cannot handle situations where moving target signals interfere with high clutter environments. By use of multi-channel STAP techniques and along-track arrays with more than two channels enough degrees of freedom are available such that even high clutter can be suppressed and at the same time target motion parameters can be estimated. In the frame of this work various STAP parameter estimation algorithms are implemented and tested. The performance of the estimators is tested by use of Monte-Carlo simulations and compared to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). In a next step the estimators are tested with experimental F-SAR four-channel X-band data and the performance achieved with the real data is compared to the performance predicted by the CRLB and achieved in the Monte Carlo simulations in order to evaluate the quality of the performance prediction. With airborne radar systems and GMTI applications usually high PRF values are used such that the stationary world signals are highly oversampled. This is not possible with spaceborne radar systems due <b>to</b> <b>swath</b> width restrictions induced by the range ambiguities. For spaceborne multi-channel SAR systems range and azimuth ambiguities usually have to be considered for GMTI applications and the choice of the antenna length, the number of channels and the PRF are critical parameters in the multi-channel SAR satellite system design. Since the STAP parameter estimation techniques provide a general processing rule for coherently combining the signals from along-track arrays with arbitrary number of channels, arbitrary arrangement of the channels (as long as the system can be considered quasi-monostatic) and PRF they can also very well be used for the multi-channel SAR satellite system design. The impact of the antenna length, the number of channels and the PRF on the predicted moving target motion parameter estimation accuracy is shown for various near-future multi-channel SAR satellite system concepts...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} use of {{crop yield}} monitoringequipment, it is now more feasible tomeasure spatial crop response to variablewater and nutrient applications. During the past decade, there has been increasing interest in applying water and chemicals to crops based on need or yield potential rather than applying uniformly to the entire field. While ground-driven variable-rate chemical application equipment is now being used, most irrigation systems continue to apply nominally uniform water depths. Some of the traveling irrigation systems {{have the capability to}} vary application depths by changing travel speed but only for large areas constrained <b>to</b> <b>swaths</b> along the system structure. For site-specific crop management to be acceptable to growers, variable application depths must be available in smaller, arbitrary areas, which requires that each sprinkler or nozzle be capable of variable flow rates.

Basically, the model has been realized for mission analysis and simulation, as will be shown in the next chapter.
