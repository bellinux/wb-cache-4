40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{different}} models for track flexibility on the simulation of railway vehicle running dynamics on tangent and curved track. To this end, a multi-body model of the rail vehicle is defined including track flexibility effects on three levels of detail: a perfectly rigid pair of rails, a sectional <b>track</b> <b>model</b> and a three-dimensional finite element <b>track</b> <b>model.</b> The influence of the <b>track</b> <b>model</b> on the calculation of the nonlinear critical speed is pointed out and it is shown that neglecting {{the effect of}} track flexibility results in an overestimation of the critical speed by more than 10 %. Vehicle response to stochastic excitation from track irregularity is also investigated, analysing the effect of track flexibility models on the vertical and lateral wheel-rail contact forces. Finally, {{the effect of the}} <b>track</b> <b>model</b> on the calculation of dynamic forces produced by wheel out-of-roundness is analysed, showing that peak dynamic loads are very sensitive to the <b>track</b> <b>model</b> used in the simulation...|$|E

30|$|Results of {{the contact}} forces under {{different}} structure flexibilities are presented for {{two kinds of}} rail corrugation: a randomly corrugated track and several single-harmonic corrugated tracks. For the random corrugation, the Timoshenko beam <b>track</b> <b>model</b> shows obvious difference compared with a rigid <b>track</b> <b>model.</b> Force peaks on the three directions {{could be found in}} the discrete support flexible track at each sleeper bay position. In the frequency range below 800  Hz, the flexible <b>track</b> <b>model</b> shows lower contact forces than the rigid model, while for frequency higher than 1000  Hz, the contact forces of the flexible <b>track</b> <b>model</b> are slightly higher than for the rigid <b>track</b> <b>model.</b> The rotating flexibility of the wheelset produces a higher longitudinal force when compared with a non-rotating flexible wheelset, while the vertical and lateral forces show little difference between the two wheelset models. For the single-harmonic corrugation case, the numerical results show that the wheel–rail contact force amplitude is generally increasing with growing velocities and shows a peak when the frequency of excitation meets the resonance frequencies of the flexible structure. However, it must be highlighted that the effect of velocity is more remarkable.|$|E
40|$|In {{the future}} International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment, high {{performance}} tracking {{is essential to}} its physics program including precision Higgs studies. One of major challenges for a detector such as the proposed International Large Detector (ILD) is to provide excellent momentum resolution in a magnetic filed with small (but non-negligible) non-uniformity. The non-uniform magnetic field implies deviation from a helical track and hence requires the extension of a helical <b>track</b> <b>model</b> used for track fitting in a uniform magnetic field. In this paper, a segment-wise helical <b>track</b> <b>model</b> is introduced as such an extension. The segment-wise helical <b>track</b> <b>model</b> approximates the magnetic field between two nearby measurement sites to be uniform and steps between the two sites along a helix. The helix frame is then transformed {{according to the new}} magnetic field direction for the next step, so as {{to take into account the}} non-uniformity of the magnetic field. Details of the algorithm and mathematical aspects of the segment-wise helical <b>track</b> <b>model</b> in a Kalman-filter-based track fitting in the non-uniform magnetic field are elaborated. The new <b>track</b> <b>model</b> is implemented and successfully tested in the framework of the Kalman filter tracking software package, KalTest, which was originally developed for tracking in a uniform magnetic field.

40|$|Tropical cyclone (TC) or typhoon wind hazard {{and risk}} are {{significant}} for China. The return period value of the maximum typhoon wind speed is used to characterize the typhoon wind hazard and assign wind load in building design code. Since the historical surface observations of typhoon wind speed are often scarce and of short period, the typhoon wind hazard assessment is often carried out using the wind field model and TC <b>track</b> <b>model.</b> For a few major cities in the coastal region of mainland China, simple or approximated wind field models and a circular subregion method (CSM) {{have been used to}} assess the typhoon wind hazard in different studies. However, there are differences among the values given by these studies and by the Chinese building design code. Moreover, {{there is a lack of}} a TC full <b>track</b> <b>model</b> simulating the TC from genesis to lysis developed for China. A TC full <b>track</b> <b>model</b> and a planetary wind field model (PBL) have been applied to assess the hurricane wind hazard for the U. S. and used to update the U. S. design code. This study finds this PBL wind field model is approximated and the effect of such approximation on the estimated hurricane wind hazards needs to be investigated. By using the best track dataset given by HURDAT, the TC full <b>track</b> <b>model</b> and a simplified version are developed for the U. S. The performance of the simplified TC full <b>track</b> <b>model</b> is verified and found to be comparable with the full version. For assessing the typhoon wind hazard for China, the best track dataset released from China Meteorological Administration (CMA) is used. The PBL wind field model is used with the CSM to assess a few coastal cities of mainland China. The practice is extended to cover the whole region of the southeast part of mainland China to develop the contour maps of the typhoon wind hazards. By using the CMA best track dataset, a full <b>track</b> <b>model</b> is developed for the western North Pacific basin. This full <b>track</b> <b>model</b> is combined again with the PBL wind field model to assess the typhoon wind hazard for mainland China.

30|$|In {{state-of-the-art}} papers, different {{configurations of}} the vehicle model and the <b>track</b> <b>model</b> are used to investigate the dynamic influences of a train running along a track under specific targets. To investigate the track dynamics, detailed <b>track</b> <b>model</b> coupled with relatively simple wheelset model was used. Zhai et al. [9] investigated the influence of elastic track structures on the lateral hunting stability of different railway vehicles. Baeza et al. [10] developed a cyclic boundary <b>track</b> <b>model</b> based on modal substructuring. Di Gialleonardo et al. [13] investigated the effect of different levels of track flexibility on running behaviours of both tangent and curved tracks. To investigate the wheelset dynamics, efforts {{have been made to}} develop detailed rotating flexible wheelset model. Arnold et al. [5] and Kaiser et al. [7, 13], proposed the use of a semi-analytical solution of a rotational symmetric structure in two dimensions, using Navier’s equations. Baeza et al. [8, 11], on the other hand, modelled the rotating wheelset based on Brown and Shabana’s formulation [15, 16] of kinematics of flexible rotating structure using a Lagrangian coordinate. However, open problems still exist related to wheel–rail interaction in the high-frequency range and its relationship with wheelset flexibility. Furthermore, the effect of wheelset and track flexibility at different levels still needs to be investigated in full.|$|E
40|$|Wheel/track impact due to {{rail joints}} or wheel flats {{has been studied}} over many years. The railway track is usually assumed to be linear {{in order to simplify}} the <b>track</b> <b>model,</b> {{although}} the rail pad and ballast are actually non-linear. This may cause incorrect results to some extent in some circumstances, as the pad and ballast stiffness varies with load. In this paper wheel/track impact is studied using a non-linear <b>track</b> <b>model.</b> The rail is represented by a finite element (FE) model and is supported by a non-linear track foundation. Wheel/track impacts are simulated at different train speeds and three types of rail pad, soft, medium and stiff, are used in the simulations. It is shown that the impact forces rise dramatically when the stiff rail pads are used. On the other hand, using soft pads can reduce impact forces significantly. Compared with the results from the linear <b>track</b> <b>model,</b> both the impact force and the track vibration level are shown to be noticeably higher from the nonlinear track than those from the linear track. It is therefore concluded that linear track models are not appropriate for wheel/track impact because the track foundation stiffness varies dramatically under the impact force...|$|E
