5|$|A {{positive}} {{development for the}} Allies during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> the appearance of another Spanish force in the region. The Spanish Regency at Cádiz had sent General Joaquín Blake, with the two divisions of Zayas and Lardizábal, by sea to Ayamonte on {{the mouth of the}} Guadiana. Landing on 18 April, Blake's army moved to join General Francisco Ballesteros at the Spanish town of Xeres.|$|E
5|$|After {{stalling}} {{several hundred}} kilometres offshore, the storm weakened over cooler waters {{that it had}} upwelled. By May27, the system weakened to a cyclonic storm and by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> approaching the northwestern coastline of India, near Gujarat. The following day, the storm made landfall in the Saurashtra region as a deep depression with winds of 55km/h (35mph 3-minute winds). The depression quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated early on May29.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who {{maintained}} Frankish influence in Northumbria {{and is known}} to have supported Offa's enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> Odberht, a priest, who is almost certainly the same person as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.|$|E

5|$|Capitalization during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} as lots were sold southward to present day Oak Street, {{about a third}} of the way between Broadway and the House of Refuge. The principal road through the suburb at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> Central Plank Road, which became Third Street. The emerging area was called the Southern Extension by this time. Growth south of Oak was very slow until the Southern Exposition was held annually in the area from 1883 to 1887.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E

5|$|Following the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe {{started its}} attacks on Channel convoys {{as a prelude}} to the Battle of Britain. The primary task of JG 51 during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> to provide fighter escort to these bomber missions. The {{commander}} of JG 51, Oberst Theo Osterkamp established a policy of unrestricted combat air patrol (freie Jagd) of fighter Staffeln providing loose protection rather than close escort to the bombers, actively seeking out Royal Air Force fighters. On 7 July 1940 Oesau claimed one Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|Friday, however, {{saw more}} panic on the exchange. Morgan again {{approached}} the bank presidents, but <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> {{only able to}} convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money {{could not be used}} for margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.|$|E
5|$|From 1919 until 1920 Rau {{was head}} of the local KPD group in Zuffenhausen, and chaired the KPD {{organisation}} in Stuttgart.

Hoernle had visited Rau's youth group in Zuffenhausen and had become a long-standing friend; he was an influential teacher for Rau and made his voluminous library available to Rau to use.|$|E

5|$|Globalization at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> {{hindered}} by war, diseases {{and population growth}} in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> generally shaped by the miasma theory, and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E
5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases.

However, his tenure was marred by personal and professional conflicts with his superior, General der Flieger Erhard Milch, and Kesselring asked to be relieved. The head of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, acquiesced and Kesselring became the commander of Air District III in Dresden. On 1 October 1938, he was promoted to General der Flieger (air general) and became commander of Luftflotte 1, based in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Territories {{political}} system used at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> {{run by an}} early form of consensus government. Candidates stood for election independent of the political parties that exist in other provinces and territories and the federal level within Canada. The government had not yet developed {{to the point of}} being a Responsible government as the majority of members were appointed and not elected. The district was served by three representatives during its eight-year history.|$|E
5|$|The rectors {{were almost}} all royal favourites or up-and-coming ecclesiastical leaders, {{who would have}} rarely visited the church.

Antony Bek became bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem, but was more noted as a warrior than for his piety.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few months}} of the war's end in November 1918 a draft {{agreement}} had been accepted by the Paris Peace Conference to create a League of Nations, as a means of resolving disputes between nations by peaceful means.

5|$|Æthelred took {{possession}} of Lindsey {{again after the}} battle; the change in control <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> lasting, and Lindsey remained part of Mercia until the Viking invasion of the 9th century remade the map of England. Conflict between Northumbria and Mercia did not completely cease after this date: Scottish annals record that Æthelbald, an 8th-century Mercian king, ravaged Northumbrian territory in 740 while King Eadberht of Northumbria was absent fighting the Picts. However, the Battle of the Trent effectively ended Northumbrian involvement in southern Britain.|$|E
