Saudi Arabia and the UAE {{were the only}} two member countries not to agree to a 10% increase in January 1977 followed by an additional 5% increase in July. This led to a period of <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> with Saudi Arabia and the UAE charging $12.09 per barrel and the other OPEC countries $12.70 per barrel. In July 1977, an OPEC meeting in Stockholm ended <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing,</b> with prices re-unified at $12.70.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{commerce}} advanced here captures prominent features of retail trade: large employment, congestion effects, anonymous posted prices, and quantity discounts. This theory {{is built around}} a directed search model where buyers’ preferences are private information. The analytical solution is easily inserted in a Neoclassical growth framework. In this framework, the parameters of retail trade are calibrated using commercial margins and employment. Welfare properties depend on the sellers’ ability to charge <b>two-tier</b> <b>prices.</b> With <b>two-tier</b> <b>prices,</b> the directed search equilibrium is efficient. Otherwise, it is not.

40|$|The eastern {{route of}} the South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD-ER) project is a massive-scale interbasin system to {{transfer}} water from the Yangtze River to North China. With the infrastructure construction close to completion, the project is now faced with many complicated operations management problem at different levels. The problems are unique in that, on the one hand, the project {{is expected to be}} financially self-sustainable by charging water usages, and on the other hand, the water price is regulated for its nature as a social product. One such problem is to achieve a rational water allocation among different users by appropriate pricing schemes. In this paper, we study how to use a <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme to balance the water allocation by using a Stackelberg game model. From the study, we find that (1) the Stackelberg game always has equilibrium solutions to balance the benefit of every party in the system, which implies that the <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme can effectively coordinate the water allocation; (2) the <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme can also result in multiple desirable by-products such as encouraging the implementation of water saving mechanism and giving the local water users certain priority; and (3) the government can adjust the pricing parameters to control and balance the profit of every party. As such we conclude that the <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme is an effective way that integrates both the government control and market powers to ensure the public interest and the economic benefit, which is suitable for SNWD-ER project...|$|E
40|$|The British Post Office {{introduced}} <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> in the 1970 s. The {{basic idea}} was to differentiate First Class from Second Class mail according to service quality rather than content. Processing of Second Class Mail is deferred during peak periods, recognizing inter alia the added cost of meeting fixed service standards at such times. The introduction of <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> was a major breakthrough at the time, both from a practical {{as well as a}} theoretical point of view, and it has been employed successfully in varying forms by several other Post Offices (POs) since then. Crew, Kleindorfer and Smith (1990) (CKS) showed how <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> was related to the mainstream of the theory of peak-load pricing, which can be traced back at least to Boiteux (1949). CKS demonstrated that such servicedifferentiated pricing offered an efficient solution to the peak-load problem. In practice, the system of First Class and Second Class has continued basically unchanged from the original path-breaking idea of the 70 ’s, with some adjustments being made in the application, definition and measurement of service standards. In other areas of the postal sector, considerable change has taken place, not least in the continuation of the process of liberalization of postal markets worldwide and especially in the EU. In addition, POs are facing significant electronic competition, principally from the Internet, which was not envisaged a decade ago.

500|$|Silver {{inventories}} at the Treasury {{continued to}} drop through 1966 {{as the government}} attempted to maintain the $1.2929 price of silver. [...] The Joint Commission on the Coinage, authorized by the Coinage Act, held its first meeting in May 1967 to recommend {{how to deal with}} the situation. At its recommendation, the Treasury discontinued sales it deemed speculative, and to foreign buyers, attempting to supply only U.S. industry at that price, and resulting in a <b>two-tier</b> <b>price</b> system for silver. It also invoked its authority under the Coinage Act to prohibit the melting or export of silver coins. In June 1967, it obtained legislation making silver certificates no longer exchangeable for bullion effective after a year. After the Joint Commission's second meeting, in July 1967, the Treasury announced that it would no longer attempt to maintain the $1.2929 price as it could keep the nation supplied even if all the remaining silver coins vanished from circulation, as they soon did. By the time silver certificate redemptions ended on June 24, 1968, the price of silver had risen to $2.56 per ounce. Although the Joint Commission in December 1968 voted to recommend making the prohibitions on melting or exporting silver coin permanent, it reconsidered and in March 1969, the bans were lifted. In November 1969, the government left the silver market, making its final sales of bullion to the Franklin Mint. Mint marks returned to the coinage in 1968.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive {{femtocell}} {{has been}} envisioned as a promis-ing technology for covering indoor environment and assisting heavy-loaded macrocell network. Although lots of technical issues of cognitive femtocell network have been studied, e. g., spectrum sharing, interference mitigation, etc., the economic {{issues that are}} very important for practical femtocell deployment have not been well investigated in the literatures. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} pricing issues in the cognitive femtocell network and propose a <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> game theoretic framework with two models: static and dynamic pricing models. In the static pricing model, we derive the closed-form expressions for pricing and demand functions, as well as the Nash equilibrium pricing strategies for both macrocell and femtocell operators. In the dynamic pricing model, we first model the cognitive users ’ network access behavior as a two-dimensional Markov decision process and propose a modified value iteration algorithm to find the best strategy profiles for cognitive users. Based on the analysis of users ’ behavior, we further design an iterative gradient descent algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium pricing strategies for both macrocell and femto-cell operators. Simulation results verify our theoretic analysis and show that the proposed algorithm in the dynamic pricing model can quickly converge to the Nash equilibrium prices.

Our main finding is that simply eliminating the multipart tariff structure does not necessarily lead to better decisions. Rather it is multipart tariffs with included values in excess of monthly fees, thus entailing <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> structures with increasing marginal costs, which lead to the worst decisions.

40|$|India's {{government}} procures {{agricultural products}} such as rice, wheat, and sugar at below-market prices and sells them in both urban and rural ration shops. The rest of such crops is sold in the open market. This creates a <b>two-tier</b> <b>price</b> system for consumers and producers. Many (including Dantwala, Mellor, and Hayami, Subbarao, and Otsuka) claim that such a policy raises the open-market price {{so much that it}} ultimately increases the average price received by farmers. Iftrue, the gainers would be the farm sector as a whole and low-income urban consumers with access to the ration shops. Losers would be the high-income urban consumers who buy at the open-market price. This view has provided an intellectual basis for the policy. The author examines a variety of cases: with and without rationing, with rationing by ration cards or by queuing, with and without the urban rich having access to the ration shops, with and without free trade, and with a marketable surplus with positive, negative, or zero price elasticity. He finds that in most cases the policy's impact on the average price is either negative or ambiguous, and it is negative in the more realistic cases. A negative impact implies that farmers on the whole lose from the procurement policy. But small farmers who are net buyers of the procured crops, and landless laborers, gain from a lower average price in the short run (especially if they have easy access to the rural ration shops). The long-run effect depends on the impact of the lower average price on rural employment and wages.

40|$|The dairy {{industry}} in Korea has achieved remarkable {{growth over the}} past three decades, mainly supported by the rapid expansion of fluid milk consumption. However, at the Uruguay Round, Korea failed to build proper tariff barriers for formulated butter and mixed milk powder, which have strong competitiveness, fungibles for butter and milk powder. Therefore, both have only single-rate tariffs of 8 percent for formulated butter and 36 percent for mixed milk powder. Consequently, following the enactment of WTO agreement in 1995, domestically manufactured dairy products lost markets due to the increased imports of formulated butter and mixed milk powder. And the {{dairy industry}} in Korea has suffered from raw milk in excess of fluid milk use. Drastic policy changes including a <b>two-tier</b> <b>price</b> system have been introduced as the stock of milk powder reached unprecedented high levels in June 2002. Also, a committee consisting of producers, processors, university professors, cooperatives and government officials was formed to discuss dairy reforms. The committee reached a consensus on the introduction of a marketing quota. However, the details of the quota system are still to be settled, since producers and processors failed to bridge the gap regarding the methods of moving to realizing the quota. Nevertheless, the Korean dairy industry needs an early settlement of dairy reforms based on the marketing quota, to secure stabilization of dairy markets. For this, producers and processors need to negotiate a new system under which both can be represented on an equal footing. Also, the government has to play {{a more active role in}} suggesting arbitration acceptable by both parties. In addition, dairy farming in the future is required to maintain environmentally friendly management by establishing an area-wide mixed farming system and providing consumers with safe and fresh dairy products at reasonable prices...|$|R
40|$|The {{roll-out}} {{of smart}} meters in electricity networks introduces risks for consumer privacy {{due to increased}} measurement frequency and granularity. Through various Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring techniques, consumer behavior may be inferred from their metering data. In this paper, we propose an energy management method that reduces energy cost and protects privacy through the minimization of information leakage. The method {{is based on a}} Model Predictive Controller that utilizes energy storage and local generation, and that predicts the effects of its actions on the statistics of the actual energy consumption of a consumer and that seen by the grid. Computationally, the method requires solving a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program of manageable size whenever new meter readings are available. We simulate the controller on generated residential load profiles with different privacy costs in a <b>two-tier</b> time-of-use energy <b>pricing</b> environment. Results show that information leakage is effectively reduced at the expense of increased energy cost. The results also show that with the proposed controller the consumer load profile seen by the grid resembles a mixture between that obtained with Non-Intrusive Load Leveling and Lazy Stepping.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} the issue costs and initial pricing of bonds {{in the international}} market. In particular, we investigate the determinants of three components of issue costs: underwriter fee, underwriter spread (the difference between the offering price and the guaranteed price to the issuer), and underpricing (the difference between the market price and the offering price). Total underwriter compensation increases with the bonds ’ credit risk and maturity, but it is insignificantly related to issue size. Interestingly, underwriters appear to price some issue characteristics directly (by adjusting the fee) and other characteristics indirectly (by setting the guaranteed price). The two compensation components (fee and spread) are negatively related to each other. We provide evidence that this trade-off is consistent with income tax considerations, {{as well as with}} <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> by underwriters. We find no evidence of underpricing...|$|E
40|$|Many new demand {{response}} strategies are emerging for energy management in smart grids. Real-Time Energy Pricing (RTP) is one {{important aspect of}} consumer Demand Side Management (DSM), which encourages consumers to participate in load scheduling. This can help reduce peak demand and improve power system efficiency. The use of Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSSs) for load scheduling has become {{necessary in order to}} enable consumers to respond to the changing economic value of energy across different hours of the day. The type of scheduling problem encountered by a consumer IDSS is typically NP-hard, which warrants the search for good heuristics with efficient computational performance and ease of implementation. This paper presents an extensive evaluation of a heuristic scheduling algorithm for use in a consumer IDSS. A generic cost model for hourly pricing is utilized, which can be configured for traditional on/off peak pricing, RTP, Time of Use Pricing (TOUP), <b>Two-Tier</b> <b>Pricing</b> (2 TP) and combinations thereof. The heuristic greedily schedules controllable appliances to minimize smart appliance energy costs and has a polynomial worst-case computation time. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the obtained results indicate the gaps between the optimal achievable costs are negligible...|$|E
40|$|The price {{elasticity}} of raw milk supply in Japan is estimated over time by a structural time-series model in state space form, {{and the changes}} in elasticity are tested by the diagnosing test of de John and Penzer in 1998. The supply function is modeled with a local linear trend and a strictly exogenous autoregressive distributed lag price. The seasonality in the data is adjusted by a structural time-series model. In the 1970 - 1997 period, there were major dairy policy changes in Japan: a production adjustment, related penalties, and <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing.</b> Hokkaido is the region that mainly provides the supply of raw milk for milk products, while Tofuken is the region that mainly produces drinking milk. The estimated {{price elasticity}} in Hokkaido became stable after imposition of the production adjustment. On the other hand, price elasticity in Tofuken became stable after the inflation of the mid- 1970 s.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the electricity cost minimization problem in a residential network where each community {{is equipped with a}} distributed power generation source and every household in the community has a set of essential and shiftable power demands. We allow bi-directional power transactions and assume a <b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> model for the buying and selling of electricity from the grid. In this situation, {{in order to reduce the}} cost of electricity we are required to make, 1) Scheduling decisions for the shiftable demands, 2) The decisions on the amount of energy purchased from the gird by the users, 3) The decisions on the amount of energy sold to the grid by the users. We formulate a global centralized optimization problem and obtain the optimal amount of electricity consumed, sold and purchased for each household, respectively by assuming the availability of all current and future values of time-varying parameters. In reality, the lack of perfect information hampers the implementation of such global centralized optimization. Hence, we propose a distributed online algorithm which only requires the current values of the timevarying supply and demand processes. We then compare and determine the tradeoff between both formulations. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can provide effective management for household electricity usage...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{two decades}} ago, the {{information}} {{flow in the}} pharmaceutical industry was relatively simple {{and the application of}} technology was limited. However, as we progress into a more integrated world where technology has {{become an integral part of}} the business processes, the process of transfer of information has become more complicated. Today increasingly technology is being used to help the pharmaceutical firms manage their inventories and to develop new product and services. The implications are such that by a simple process of merging the drug usage and cost of medicines (after completing the legal requirements) with the patient care records of doctors and hospitals helping firms to conduct nation wide trials for its new drugs. Other possible uses of information technology in the field of pharmaceuticals include pricing (<b>two-tier</b> <b>pricing</b> strategy) and exchange of information between vertically integrated drug companies for mutual benefit. Nevertheless, the challenge remains though data collection methods have improved data manipulation techniques are yet to keep pace with them. Data mining fondly called patterns analysis on large sets of data uses tools like association, clustering, segmentation and classification for helping better manipulation of the data help the pharma firms compete on lower costs while improving the quality of drug discovery and delivery methods.

40|$|The current HIV/AIDS {{scenario}} in India is quite grim {{with an estimated}} 2. 4 million people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in 2008, just behind South Africa and Nigeria. The anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) remain the main stay of global HIV/AIDS treatment. Over 30 ARVs (single and FDCs) available under six categories viz., NRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), Protease inhibitors, the new Fusion inhibitors, Entry inhibitors-CCR 5 co-receptor antagonists and HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors. The major originator companies for these ARVs are: Abbott, Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck, Pfizer, Roche, and Tibotec. Beginning with zidovidine in 1987, all the drugs {{are available in the}} developed countries. In India, about 30 ARVs are available as generics manufactured by Aurobindo, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh; Cipla Limited, Goa; Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Pune, Maharashtra; Hetero Drugs, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh; Macleods Pharmaceuticals, Daman; Matrix Laboratories, Nashik, Maharashtra; Ranbaxy, Sirmour, Himachal Pradesh; and Strides Arcolab, Bangalore, Karnataka. The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) set up in 1992 by the Govt. of India provides free ARVs to HIV positive patients in India since 2004. The drugs available in India include both single drugs and FDCs covering both first line and second line ARVs. Even while there are claims of stabilization of the disease load, there is still huge gap of those who require ARVs as only about 150, 000 PLHA receive the ARVs from the Govt. and other sources. Access to ARVs therefore is still a cause of serious concern ever since India became fully Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) -complaint in 2005. Therefore, the Indian pharmaceutical companies cannot make generics for those for drugs introduced post- 2005 due to product patent regime. Other concerns include heat stable, other better formulations and second line ARVs for adults and more drugs and formulations for paediatric groups, that are still to be widely available in India and other developing countries. To examine whether strong intellectual property (IP) protection systems are to be considered important barriers for the limited or lack of access to ARVs, we studied the patent profile of the ARVs of the originator companies within and outside India. We could record 93 patents in the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). The originator companies have been also aggressively filing and enforcing patents in India. There have been a few efforts by companies like Gilead and GSK to grant licenses to generic manufacturers in developing countries, ostensibly to promote access to ARVs through lower (<b>two-tier)</b> <b>pricing.</b> These steps are considered as too little and too late. There is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies to promote access to ARVs both linked to and independent of IPRs. Patent pooling as a viable strategy mooted by the UNITAID should be seriously explored to promote access to ARVs. India is ideally suited for trying out the patent pool strategy as most of the global requirement of affordable ARV drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment is sourced from Indian generic companies...|$|E
