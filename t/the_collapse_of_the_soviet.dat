5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes brought about by <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation {{in dealing with the}} numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E

5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Production {{slowed down}} with <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and {{economic}} stagnation {{in the independent}} Republic of Georgia. In 1995, bottling of Borjomi was restarted by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Waters Company (GG), which increased the production forty-fold. According to the company, 80% of Borjomi produced that year was exported abroad—more than half of this amount to Russia. Despite counterfeit drinks being produced under the Borjomi label {{as a result of}} rising piracy during the 1990s, Borjomi water was able to reclaim its reputation by 2000 in a distinctive packaging campaign. The piracy also slowed down due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately after <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the Soviet Navy fell apart, without {{sufficient}} {{personnel to}} man {{many of its}} ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, {{many of them were}} sold to foreign nations. This left the United States as the world's undisputed naval superpower. U.S. naval forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' naval power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States naval strategy was based on the overall military strategy of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to {{capitalist}} reformers between 1989 and 1991 {{and many}} Western observers expected {{the same in}} Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election. With <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted {{that this was a}} manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|The first variant was {{designed}} during the 1980s as an upgrade of the Su-27, and was initially {{known as the}} Su-27M. This derivative incorporated canards and a multi-function radar that transformed the aircraft into a multi-role aircraft, and was structurally reinforced to support its heavier weight. The first prototype made its maiden flight in June 1988. As the aircraft was not mass produced due to <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Sukhoi re-designated the aircraft as Su-35 to attract export orders. At the same time, the fourteen aircraft produced were used for tests and demonstrations; one example had thrust-vectoring engines installed, and the resultant Su-37 {{was used as a}} technology demonstrator. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that strongly resembled the Su-30MK family.|$|E

5|$|After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy {{entered the}} 45 year long Cold War {{and participated in}} the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Persian Gulf War, and the Second Persian Gulf War / Iraq War. Following <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy fell apart, which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. Nuclear power and {{ballistic}} missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which {{were used in the}} s and s. By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was gradually}} modernised {{in the decades}} following the Second World War, including newer main artillery {{for some of the}} forts and newer secondary artillery for all forts as well as other improvements. But the development of new weapons and the evolution of warfare during the Cold War gradually decreased the importance of the fortifications. Weapons such as cruise missiles and smart bombs made large static fortifications such as Boden Fortress obsolete when they demonstrated their worth during the Gulf War in 1991. Mjösjöberget Fort had been decommissioned and removed from the wartime organisation twelve years earlier in 1979, and less than ten years after the Gulf War and <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the four other forts followed suit. The last shot was fired from Rödberget on 14:11 local time on 31 December 1997, and exactly one year later, on 31 December 1998, that last fort was decommissioned after 90 years in service.|$|E
