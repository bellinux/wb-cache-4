5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>runs</b> the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{refers to}} Jack Kevorkian, the right-to-die activist {{best known for}} his {{advocacy}} of physician-assisted suicide, although Kyle mistakenly refers to him as [...] "Jack Leborkian". When Terrance and Phillip is cancelled in [...] "Death", it is replaced by She's the Sheriff, a sitcom starring actress Suzanne Somers. The Cartoon Central network in [...] "Death" [...] is based on Comedy Central, the real-life television network that broadcasts South Park. John Warsog, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>runs</b> Cartoon Central in [...] "Death", is based on Doug Herzog, the Comedy Central executive who was responsible for bringing South Park to the network. Herzog was excited to be featured in the episode and enjoyed the portrayal. During one scene, Stan's grandfather locks him in a room and plays music by the Irish vocalist Enya as a form of torture to show Stan what it's like to be his age, and convince Stan to kill him. The parody of Enya's Orinoco Flow used in [...] "Death" [...] was sung by Toddy Walters, who played protagonist Polly Pry in Trey Parker's 1996 film, Cannibal! The Musical. [...] "Death" [...] marked the first appearance of Snacky Cakes, one of Cartman's favorite snack foods.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Wanna later {{commented that}} [...] "with Labor in disarray, {{no amount of}} money, {{campaign}} tactics or flying visits could repair the damage." [...] A political commentator based in Townsville told the Sydney Morning Herald that the electoral roll had changed by about 30% since July, due {{to a lot of}} movement by public servants and the army, and that some new residents did not qualify to vote as they had arrived too late to enrol. On election day, The Age described the campaign in retrospect as a [...] "thrill-a-minute plot with spellbinding dirty tricks that have kept locals—used to this sort of thing—away in droves", and characterised the main candidates as [...] "the man who talks to God, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>runs</b> on hurt, or the ambitious Mayor".|$|E

[...] "A beautiful boat, but <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>runs</b> her will want a coal-mine of his own. Got her cheap, I figure, but it's only at top-freights she could make a living. Guess Merril's screwing all he can out of those miners, but those rates won't last when the C.P.R. and the Americans cut in, and if I had a boat of that kind I'd put up a big insurance and then scuttle her." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stood still}} for another few moments, grim in face, with his jacket rent, {{and a little}} trickle of blood running from one hand which a thorn had gashed. Every nerve in him tingled with fierce anger, {{but he knew that}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>runs</b> counter to {{established}} customs has usually more than misconception to face in Africa, especially if he sympathizes with the oppressed, and he was one who could wait. Then the boys came floundering through the undergrowth, one or two with heavy matchets, and one or two with long flintlock guns, but Ormsgill, who recognized that pursuit would certainly prove futile even if they were willing to undertake it, drove them back to the fire again.|$|E

"She's {{a rising}} {{religious}} reformer {{who has taken}} several towns on Puget Sound by storm," [...] said the surveyor, [...] "and it has cost somebody considerable to bring her here. That protégé of yours is clearly a crank, but he's also more of a man than he looks, and, {{if it can be}} done unofficially, I'm inclined to back him. No, I'm not a teetotaler, and as a rule we're a sober people in Western Canada, but they're a tolerably hard crowd down at Cedar, and if once <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>runs</b> the Magnolia takes hold with his tables we'll have chaos in this camp. I'm not prejudiced, but if they must have excitement I'd sooner see the boys whooping round a temperance meeting than a gaming bank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like {{pictures}} {{as well as}} you do," [...] said Mary Louise, [...] "and Gran'pa Jim often takes me to see them. Tuesday night a man shot another in cold blood and the girl the murderer was in love with helped him to escape and married him. I felt like giving her a good shaking, didn't you? She didn't act like a real girl at all. And Thursday night the picture story told of a man with two wives and of divorces and disgraceful doings generally. Gran'pa Jim took me away before it was over and I was glad to go. Some of the pictures are fine and dandy, but as long as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>runs</b> the theatre mixes the horrid things with the decent ones--and we can't know beforehand which is which--it's really the safest plan to keep away from the place altogether. I'm sure that's the position Miss Stearne takes, and we can't blame her for it. If we do, it's an evidence of laxness of morals in ourselves." ...|$|E
