5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his bridle {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the bridle after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth. But coming to the third barrel, she has to <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> loose.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|William D. Haywood {{was born}} in 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. His father, a former Pony Express rider, died of {{pneumonia}} when Haywood was three years old. His maternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in the Orange Free State in 1820. At age nine, he injured his right eye while whittling a slingshot with a knife, permanently blinding his right eye. Haywood never had his damaged eye replaced with a glass eye; when photographed, he would <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to show his left profile. That same year, he began working in the mines, never having received much formal education. After brief stints as a cowboy and a homesteader, he returned to mining in 1896. High-profile {{events such as the}} gradual demise of the Molly Maguires, the Haymarket Massacre in 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894 fostered Haywood's interest in the labor movement.|$|E
60|$|He had not <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at {{the opening}} or closing of the door, but {{presently}} another sound broke the silence. It was a woman's sob, and as he slowly <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> a tall, graceful figure moved forward out of the shadows, and he heard his name softly murmured.|$|R

5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
500|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{aimed to}} create a look for the Son'a that was not exaggerated. He consulted several sculptors; Dean Jones, {{who was on the}} production staff for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, created the look. The prosthetics for Ru'afo consisted of overlapping layers that were stretched over Abraham's head. Westmore said Abraham's prosthetics was [...] "like a rubber band, F. Murray Abraham could <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and the skin would look translucent. It was so thin, and the layers were pulling on each other." [...] The two other aliens on the Son'a vessels also had specific prosthetic make-up designs created. The Tarlac's look was based reptilian skin, while the Ellora required only nose and forehead prosthetics.|$|E
500|$|By 11 September 1917, Voss {{had raised}} his victory total to 47, {{second only to}} the Red Baron's 61. In the process, he had his closest call yet in combat. After {{shooting}} down six-victory ace Oscar McMaking, he had in turn been attacked by Captain Norman Macmillan. Macmillan dove his Sopwith Camel within six meters (20 feet) of Voss, machine guns spurting tracers that flew near the German's head. The 45 Squadron ace saw Voss <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> twice to judge the Camel's position before evading. Then a Royal Aircraft Factory RE.8 blundered across between them, nearly colliding with the Camel and breaking off the attack as Voss dove away. Macmillan claimed an [...] "out of control" [...] victory when he returned to base.|$|E

500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean." ...|$|E
500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item {{in and out of his}} coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into a no-win situation (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E
500|$|While Pixar usually designs their {{characters}} to be caricatured, Carl {{was even more}} so, being only three heads high. He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, pockmarks on his nose, a hearing aid, and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded like a balloon. The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the [...] "uncanny valley". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> more than 15–20degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high. However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible {{near the end of}} the film, transforming into an [...] "action hero".|$|E

2500|$|... {{again in}} the New Testament and based on a text from the Old Testament book of Ezekiel (12:1–2) is: [...] "The word of the Lord came to me: [...] 'Oh mortal, you dwell among the rebellious breed. They have eyes to see but see not; ears to hear, but hear not." [...] In [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", Dylan {{transforms}} this into [...] "Yes'n' how many ears must one man have...?" [...] and [...] "Yes' n' how many times must a man <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> / Pretending he just doesn't see?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 22, 1991, Dahmer {{approached}} {{three men}} {{with an offer}} of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs, drink beer and simply keep him company. One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, [...] "What's happening?" [...] Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together, then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters {{on the wall and}} that a videotape of The Exorcist III was playing; he also noted a blue 57-gallon drum in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.|$|E
2500|$|One {{must say}} the Amidah every day, but may abbreviate {{it if he}} is not {{familiar}} with the prayers or an emergency situation comes up. ( [...] , Bartenura) One who makes his praying a mechanical task is not praying. When one enters a dangerous situation, he or she should say a short prayer for safety. (...) If one is riding a donkey, he must dismount to say the Amidah. If he cannot dismount, he must <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards Jerusalem. If he cannot do that, he must turn his heart to God. This also applies to one travelling on a ship or in a wagon. ( [...] , [...] ) Musaf must always be said on the days it is required {{regardless of whether or not}} there is a minyan ("quorum") present. (...) One should not say the Amidah if he or she is not serious about what he or she is doing. (...) The Musaf of Pesach ("Passover") must include a prayer for rain. (...) ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 17, 2016, Bermúdez Zacarías went on {{a morning}} jog nearby his home in Metepec, an upscale exurb [...] outside of Mexico City. As he was {{crossing}} a side {{street in front of}} a private residential neighborhood entrance, a man dressed in black ran up to him from behind and shot him at point-blank range {{in the head with a}} 9 mm pistol. Bermúdez Zacarías was able to <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> briefly before the gunman delivered the shot in the back of his head. The judge fell to the ground bleeding and curled into fetal position before rolling on his back and spreading his legs and arms. The assassin then ran back and startled a cyclist and a pedestrian before catching up with his accomplice, who was waiting for him from a distance, before fleeing the scene. While Bermúdez Zacarías was on the ground, a car stopped next to him for a few seconds before continuing its course. A second vehicle turned towards the street Bermúdez Zacarías was on, but continued driving inside the residential neighborhood after stopping momentarily. The security guards from the residential neighborhood then called an ambulance. He was transported to Regional Hospital 251 of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Metepec, but doctors confirmed that he died before reaching the hospital. The murder scene was cordoned by the Metepec municipal police, the State of Mexico police, and members of the State of Mexico Attorney General Office. All three law enforcement agencies conducted an investigation at the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was gunned down.|$|E
