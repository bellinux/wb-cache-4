25|$|The nobby is an inshore {{sailing boat}} {{which was used}} as a {{traditional}} fishing boat around Lancashire and the Isle of Man. The Lancashire nobby originated in Morecambe Bay about 1840 and around Southport. It subsequently came into widespread use down the north west coast of England. The Manx nobby first appeared in the 1880s and was used around the Isle of Man. Many localities on the coast of Great Britain developed their own <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> boat adapted to local fishing and sea conditions, and the nobbies are examples of this.|$|E
25|$|A rod can bend in {{different}} curves. Traditionally the bending curve is mainly determined by its tapering. In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend {{a lot more}} in the tip area and not much in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend too much at the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top to butt, adding in power the deeper the rod is bent. In practice, the tapers of quality rods often are curved or in steps to achieve the right action and bending curve for the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> a rod is built. In today's practice, different fibres with different properties {{can be used in a}} single rod. In this practice, there is no straight relationship anymore between the actual tapering and the bending curve.|$|E

25|$|In Australia and Japan, {{members of}} the family are highly sought after by anglers for their {{sporting}} and eating qualities, with anglers often taking more than commercial fishermen in some areas. The fishing techniques for all sillaginids are quite similar, with the shallow habitats often requiring light line and quiet movements. Whiting are also popular in part due to their accessibility, with tidal flats around beaches, estuaries and jetties common habitats from where many whiting species are caught without need for a boat. Tidal movements also affect catches, as do lunar phases, causing whiting to 'bite' when the tide is changing. Tackle used is kept light to avoid spooking the fish, and often requires only a simple setup, with a hook and light sinker tied directly to the mainline usually effective. In deeper water fished from boats or where currents are strong, more complex rigs are used, often with hooks tied to dropper loops on the trace. in Australia, some specialist whiting fishermen who target the fish in the surf or on shallow banks use red beads or tubing to attract the fish, claiming the method produces more fish. The bait used is normally anything from the surrounding environment which the whiting naturally prey on, with polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans such as prawns and crabs, cephalopods and small fish effective for most species. As with most species, live bait is known to produce better catches. Lure fishing for whiting is not normally practiced, but saltwater flies have been used to good effect, as have small soft plastic lures and surface lures like poppes and stick baits imitating a fleeing fish or prawn. this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> has experienced increasing popularity the last couple of years. In some areas, restrictions to the amount and size of fish are in place and enforced by fishery authorities.|$|E
500|$|The hoeker {{originated}} in the 15th century as a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> vessel {{with one or two}} masts in response to the growing Dutch trade in herring, and was known in English as a hoy. Equipped with guns, hoekers were employed as defensive escorts for fishing fleets, or Buisconvoyers, in the Second Anglo-Dutch War of the 1660s. They came to be used more widely in trade with the Dutch East Indies via the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, as their rounded sterns proved to be more resistant to warping and ing than square sterns, which were prone to [...] "catastrophic leaking when exposed to strong sun." [...] Larger than most hoekers, the Meermin was unusual for her type in that she was built of oak and had a beakhead, a feature not normally present in smaller merchant vessels.|$|E
2500|$|An {{artificial}} fly or fly lure is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> lure, usually used in {{the sport}} of fly fishing (although {{they may also be}} used in other forms of angling). In general, artificial flies are an imitation of natural food sources which fly fishers present to their [...] of fish while fly fishing. Artificial flies are constructed by fly tying, in which furs, feathers, thread or any of very many other materials are tied onto a fish hook. Artificial flies may be constructed to represent all manner of potential freshwater and saltwater fish prey to include aquatic and terrestrial insects, crustaceans, worms, baitfish, vegetation, flesh, spawn, small reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds, etc. Effective artificial fly patterns are said to be killing flies because of their ability to put fish in the creel for the fly fisher. There are thousands of artificial fly patterns, many of them with descriptive and often idiosyncratic names.|$|E
40|$|The {{economics}} <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gears on lake Kainji {{had been}} analyzed. The result has shown that, all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gears in {{use on the}} lake have net returns that represent gains on the users investments, and on average, earned profits. Furthermore, {{the size of the}} net returns –gain, depends on the amount of user’s investment and the profitability <b>of</b> each <b>fishing</b> method positively correlates with amount of input. The operational costs, catch and revenues did not only vary between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gears in different localities but also in the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> unit for each trip in the same locality.

2500|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "power value" [...] or [...] "rod weight". Rods may be {{classified}} as ultra-light, light, medium-light, medium, medium-heavy, heavy, ultra-heavy, or other similar combinations. Power is often an indicator of what types of fishing, species of fish, or size of fish a particular pole may be best used for. Ultra-light rods are suitable for catching small bait fish and also panfish, or situations where rod responsiveness is critical. Ultra-Heavy rods are used in deep sea fishing, surf fishing, or for heavy fish by weight. While manufacturers use various designations for a rod's power, there is no fixed standard, hence application of a particular power tag by a manufacturer is somewhat subjective. Any fish can theoretically be caught with any rod, of course, but catching panfish on a heavy rod offers no sport whatsoever, and successfully landing a large fish on an ultralight rod requires supreme rod handling skills at best, and more frequently ends in broken tackle and a lost fish. Rods are best suited to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> they are intended for.|$|E
