5|$|Lichtenstein {{made several}} {{alterations}} {{to the source}} images as he compiled them into this composition. He used themes in this work that relate to those expressed in several of his other works. The narrative content is also said to relate to themes from other works, but instead of Lichtenstein's own works it relates <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> Pollock's contemporaneous works.|$|E

In 1835, he graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and in 1838, he earned {{a law degree from}} Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. Afterward, he moved <b>to</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Mississippi where he began his legal career. From 1838 to 1839, he served as Reading Clerk for the Mississippi state senate.|$|E

50|$|Jacksons of Piccadilly {{claim they}} {{originated}} Earl Grey's Tea, Lord Grey having given the recipe <b>to</b> Robert <b>Jackson</b> & Co. partner George Charlton in 1830. According <b>to</b> <b>Jacksons,</b> the original recipe {{has been in}} constant production and has never left their hands. Theirs {{has been based on}} Chinese black tea since the beginning.|$|R
5|$|The song, {{along with}} a 3-D short film {{that was to be}} {{featured}} in Jackson's series of comeback concerts This Is It, was performed as a tribute <b>to</b> <b>Jackson.</b> Jennifer Hudson, Carrie Underwood, Smokey Robinson, Celine Dion and Usher all sang the song together, while the video played in the background. The film was shown in its original 3-D format during the broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2000, Corzine denied {{having made}} {{payments}} to African-American ministers, although the foundation controlled by Jon and Joanne Corzine had paid one influential black church $25,000. Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, {{director of the}} Black Ministers Council, had campaigned against a form of racial profiling whereby police officers stop minority drivers and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, fired. Corzine had donated <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> prior to getting {{what appears to be}} a reciprocal endorsement.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society, which {{promotes}} the exploration, settlement, {{and development of}} the Moon, named a Moon crater after Jackson. In the same year, for Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. In 2010, two university librarians found that Jackson's influence extended to academia, with references <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> in reports concerning music, popular culture, chemistry and an array of other topics.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Edie (Nicollette Sheridan) {{returns to}} Wisteria Lane after a five-year absence {{with her new}} husband, Dave (Neal McDonough).

Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) deals with her daughters' weight problems and Bree (Marcia Cross) faces the ramifications of her success.|$|E
5|$|Most of the equipment, arms, and {{machinery}} at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to {{east of the}} Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862, and accountability for it is lost at that point. By all appearances, the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, and from there <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> Mississippi, where it was probably destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982, Michael McDonald {{released}} a song titled [...] "I Keep Forgettin (Every Time Youre Near)", its similarity <b>to</b> <b>Jacksons</b> [...] "I Keep Forgettin" [...] resulted in Leiber and Stoller {{being given a}} songwriting credit.|$|R
50|$|Malcolm Colcord began <b>to</b> {{distrust}} <b>Jackson</b> later on, {{and during}} an argument over Sabretooth's loyalties and criminal behavior, Colcord slapped Jackson. When <b>Jackson</b> tried <b>to</b> attack Colcord in retaliation, {{he learned that}} he had an implanted chip that prevented him from doing so. Colcord then suspended him from duty and imprisoned him. Eventually, the director decided <b>to</b> return <b>Jackson</b> <b>to</b> duty but under close observation.|$|R

5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; she would give the baby <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> as a friendly favor and he would raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|Production {{then moved}} to Magazine Street, where {{production}} designer Brian Morris and the art department recreated 1950s New Orleans. Filming then moved <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> Square where the crew filmed one of the final scenes, in which Angel runs from Margaret's home. The production then filmed a voodoo ceremony scene choreographed by Louis Falco. Falco, who had previously choreographed Parker's 1980 film Fame, was inspired by an actual Haitian ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Seward {{originally}} {{supported the}} Regency, but by 1824 had broken from it, concluding it was corrupt. He {{became part of}} the Anti-Masonic Party, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; he was most likely killed by fellow Masons for publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition <b>to</b> <b>Jackson,</b> and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.|$|E
50|$|As a Brevet Major, Jackson next {{looked forward}} to what future {{assignments}} that the United States Army had to offer.

Sainsbury's stock lines included newspapers and magazines, and Egginton News closed, transferring some staff <b>to</b> <b>Jacksons</b> and the delivery service account to another newsagency over a mile away.|$|R
5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of the bad blood between the two. According <b>to</b> <b>Jackson,</b> the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Winchester, on June 2, Steuart was {{involved}} in an unfortunate incident in which the 2nd Virginia Cavalry was mistakenly fired on by the 27th Virginia Infantry. Colonels Thomas Flournoy and Thomas T. Munford went to General Ewell and requested that their regiments, the 6th and 2nd Virginia Cavalry, {{be transferred to the}} command of Turner Ashby, recently promoted to Brigadier General. Ewell agreed, and went <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> for final approval. Jackson gave his consent, and {{for the remainder of the}} war Steuart would serve as an infantry commander.|$|E
5|$|Stevens's first {{political}} {{cause was}} Anti-Masonry, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance {{and death of}} William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition <b>to</b> <b>Jackson,</b> and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.|$|E

5|$|The Seventh Avenue Line Extension {{would extend}} the Broadway Line north from 59th Street via a tunnel under Central Park to 72nd Street, before turning east into Queens via Northern Boulevard <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> Heights. It {{was to have}} been built as a two-track and four-track line, and it would have cost $89,000,000. The second phase would extend the line as a two-track line along Corona Avenue and Horace Harding Boulevard from Jackson Heights to Marathon Parkway. A storage yard would be built. This phase would have cost $51,820,000. A {{connection}} between the new line and the Crosstown Line {{was to have been}} built at 23rd Street (Ely Avenue) for $10,950,000.|$|E
5|$|The species P. fimbriata was {{originally}} described by Carl Ludwig Doleschall as Salticus fimbriata in 1859. The species {{has also been}} named Attus fimbriatus (Doleschall, 1859), Sinis fimbriatus (Doleschall, 1859), Linus fimbriatus (Doleschall, 1859) and Boethoportia ocellata (Hogg, 1915), and Portia fimbriata (Doleschall, 1859), and the last is now used. According <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> and Hallas, P. fimbriata, as currently defined, probably includes two or more distinct species. In particular, Queensland P. fimbriata are probably a distinct species from Sri Lankan P. fimbriata, as matings {{between the two groups}} are infertile.|$|E
5|$|Three police constables {{from the}} Hammersmith and Fulham police station—Nicholas Jackson, Andrew Moore, and Kerry Smith—told their supervisor, Inspector Wynne Jones, on 3 April {{that they had}} {{witnessed}} the incident.

Jackson was the first to tell the inspector; officers then contacted Moore and Smith, who had been standing next <b>to</b> <b>Jackson</b> at the time.|$|E
