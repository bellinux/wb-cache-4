5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|E
500|$|Lytle has cited both The Beatles and E.L.O. as influences, stating in 2003: [...] "I'm {{completely}} {{in tune with}} E.L.O. and Jeff Lynne – I know that guy like <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hand." [...] He stated in 2009: [...] "I think {{the majority of my}} musical influences were set in stone when I was five or six years old." [...] Lytle's vocals have drawn comparisons with Neil Young.|$|E
500|$|Ron Harris was haunted {{for many}} years by his role in Masterton's death: [...] "It bothers you {{the rest of your}} life. It wasn't dirty and it wasn't meant to happen that way. Still, it's very hard because I made the play. It's always in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] But Masterton's family held no {{animosity}} towards the players involved or the game. [...] Carol referred to the incident as a fluke, saying that it could have happened to anyone.|$|E

500|$|He also {{introduced}} him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at Katedralskolan (a gymnasium) in Växjö. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine. By the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal that he [...] "read day and night, knowing like <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hand, Arvidh Månsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz's Flora Åboensis, Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana, [...] Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis...." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{began to}} appear in small-budget films which did well with critics, such as 1997's drama Inventing the Abbotts, set in the late 1950s, in which she played the part of Eleanor, one of three daughters of the town millionaire, Lloyd Abbott. About her performance, {{director}} Ron Howard said, [...] "She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity. She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty, and I guess I stored that information in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brain".|$|E
500|$|Two new sets {{of parents}} are {{introduced}} during the episode. Emma's parents, Rose and Rusty Pillsbury, are played by Valerie Mahaffey and Don Most. Mays {{was very excited}} when she learned Most, who played Ralph Malph on the 1970s sitcom Happy Days, had been cast, and exclaimed, [...] "What? He's my father?!" [...] Both Most and Mahaffey were so funny during the shooting of their sequence {{that she had to}} apologize for causing a portion to have to be reshot, telling them, [...] "I'm so sorry, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> shoulders were shaking because I was laughing so hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{is exactly}} {{the state of the}} case. I don't mind confiding to you, that I never can {{approach}} the book with perfect composure (it had such perfect possession of me when I wrote it), and that I no sooner begin to try to get it into this form, than I begin to read it all, and to feel that I cannot disturb it. I have not been unmindful of the agreement we made at parting, and I have sat staring at <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> books for an inspiration. This project {{is the only one that}} I have constantly reverted to, and yet I have made no progress in it! ...|$|R

500|$|He {{followed}} Moon {{when the}} drummer relocated to Los Angeles, but {{felt that the}} drug culture prevalent {{at the time was}} bad for Moon: [...] "My job was to have eyes in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] Townshend agreed, saying that by 1975 Butler had [...] "no influence over him whatsoever." [...] Although he was a loyal companion to Moon, the lifestyle eventually became too much for him; he phoned Curbishley, saying that they needed to move back to England or one of them might die. Butler quit in 1978, and later wrote of his experiences in a book entitled Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of Keith Moon.|$|E
500|$|Though it {{was noted}} that even [...] "She" [...] has [...] "passing moments of lyrical {{humanity}} to go with the pliant music ("When I'm with my friends I just put on a front / But in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> top I'm writing songs about 'we'"). It's almost like there's boyish innocence lurking underneath all that bile." [...] The Village Voices Eric Harvey mused that the [...] "sinuous Frank Ocean feature [...] "She" [...] ramps up the voyeurism" [...] and noted that he [...] "keeps things within a Rear Window framework. He admits he's going through the dating motions strictly to get laid, but he also says that his violent front is just a show for his boys." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Doe's {{statement}} {{also described}} her {{experience at the}} hospital and learning she was being treated for sexual assault: [...] "The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hands and elbow. … My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me." [...] Doe expresses gratitude to [...] "the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Hung Up" [...] {{is a song}} by Paul Weller {{released}} in 1994. The song was Weller's first top ten hit in seven years.

500|$|The {{video was}} really relaxed... {{it was so}} hot. I was {{literally}} dripping! Not nice! In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|For the [...] "vomit scene" [...] where Jennifer {{has just}} arrived at Needy's house after being murdered and {{inhabited}} by a demon, Fox said the liquid {{she was given}} to spit out [...] "was actually ...chocolate syrup initially". [...] "We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke Hershey's chocolate syrup. Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything", she stated. [...] "And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene..." [...] Fox said it [...] "clips on. It goes around <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ear and then I bite down on it {{on the side of}} my face, like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube..." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{has also}} {{provided}} songs {{for many other}} artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. Women at the Well (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute. According to Kelly, he adapted his song [...] "Foggy Highway" [...] for Renée Geyer because [...] "I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose up on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> neck." [...] Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a bluegrass style as the title track for the 2005 album Foggy Highway. Divinyls' lead singer Christina Amphlett recorded [...] "Before Too Long"—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la Fatal Attraction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray {{explain your}} plan," [...] said Prince Charles. [...] "The task <b>of</b> conquering <b>back</b> <b>the</b> throne <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fathers {{is not so}} simple as you seem to suppose." ...|$|R

500|$|On March 29, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt {{went to the}} Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest {{before his}} {{anticipated}} appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). At 3:35pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, “so ended an era, and so began another.” After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, [...] "Men will thank God on their knees a {{hundred years from now}} that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House".|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't {{begin to think}} of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Eve Myles {{previously}} {{appeared in}} the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] as Gwyneth, a 19th-century clairvoyant. Gwyneth had {{a connection to the}} Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are [...] "just two names beginning with [...] "G"." [...] Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of [...] "spatial genetic multiplicity". Eve Myles said of the two characters, [...] "it was never on the cards as such, but something in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head always said {{that they were going to}} be connected somehow." [...] Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that [...] "It's not familial as we understand it" [...] instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as [...] "an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{his early}} months in Congress, he {{emerged as a}} vocal critic of the Democratic Party and President Obama's fiscal policies, and posted a YouTube video in which he accused President Obama of bankrupting the country. He also vowed, [...] "I won’t place one more dollar <b>of</b> debt upon <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> kids and grandkids unless we {{structurally}} reform the way this town D.C. spends money!" [...] He became a frequent fixture on cable TV, advocating a [...] "no compromise" [...] approach to deficit reduction that rejects any tax increases on the wealthy. He consistently voted against raising the federal debt ceiling and authored {{a balanced budget amendment}} to the United States Constitution. Walsh has also said that President Obama was elected [...] "because he pushed that magical button: a black man who was articulate, liberal, the whole white guilt, all of that." [...] In his first six months in office, Walsh received over 30 appearances on television.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could never}} dare {{to walk into}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> office <b>of</b> <b>my</b> paper and face old McArdle," [...] said I. (You will excuse the frankness of this report, will you not, sir?) [...] "He'd never forgive me for leaving such unexhausted copy behind me.

500|$|Mercer soon married wealthy socialite Winthrop Rutherfurd (1862–1944), {{a widower}} then in his fifties, but despite her {{marriage}} and Franklin's promise, the two remained in surreptitious, albeit infrequent contact {{in the three}} decades that followed. Especially during the War years, Franklin's daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, more frequently after Rutherfurd's death in 1944. [...] Mercer was in Warm Springs, Georgia, at the [...] "Little White House" [...] the President's long-time cottage and retreat, {{at the time of}} Roosevelt's death in April 1945. He was having his portrait painted, at Mercer's request, by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff in the living room – with Mercer and two female cousins attending. While sitting at a card table by the fireplace, reading an upcoming speech, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious. [...] Madame Shoumatoff, who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. [...] Mercer's presence in the house was not mentioned in the immediate press reports nor in any of the early published biographies.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{returned}} to the NBA {{as coach of the}} Lakers {{near the end of the}} 1993–94 NBA season, replacing Randy Pfund, and Bill Bertka, who served as an interim coach for two games. Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner Jerry Buss, admitted [...] "I've always had the desire (to coach) in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying questions about returning as a player, saying, [...] "I'm retired. Let's leave it at that." [...] Amid speculation from general manager Jerry West that he may only coach until the end of the season, Johnson took over a team that had a 28–38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110–101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. He was coaching a team that had five of his former teammates on the roster: Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell, Tony Smith, Kurt Rambis, James Worthy, who would retire after the season, and Michael Cooper, who was brought in as an assistant. Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the 1994–95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation. The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season. The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5–11. Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994.|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
