5|$|Damage from {{enemies to}} the player's {{characters}} affect an endurance and health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health {{can only be}} restored by resting. The party can either set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in the party has their endurance drained, they are knocked out {{until the end of}} combat. If a companion has their health reduced to zero <b>they</b> <b>die</b> permanently.|$|E
5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} is necessary for life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight. Much below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, <b>they</b> <b>die</b> from toxic excess.|$|E
5|$|Late at night, Hilarion mourns at Giselle's {{grave in}} the forest, but is frightened {{away by the}} arrival of the Wilis, the ghostly spirits of maidens betrayed by their lovers. The Wilis, led by their merciless queen Myrtha, haunt the forest at night to seek revenge on any man they encounter, forcing their victims to dance until <b>they</b> <b>die</b> of exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, or <b>they</b> <b>die.</b> They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, {{and not a single}} seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E
5|$|These {{polarization}} detectors {{are sensitive}} in the ultraviolet {{region of the}} light spectrum. In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until <b>they</b> <b>die</b> of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|To {{create a}} death scene, Aronofsky drew from Mayan mythology the {{description}} of flowers and butterflies emerging from the bodies of valiant warriors when <b>they</b> <b>die.</b> Aronofsky excluded butterflies from the death scene to minimize the film's computer-generated imagery but kept the effect of flowers bursting from the body.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of {{catching}} the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins {{get caught in the}} nets and exhaust themselves until <b>they</b> <b>die,</b> or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, <b>they</b> <b>die,</b> and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, the PAP {{formed a}} workgroup, headed by Phua, to explore {{initiatives}} {{to improve the}} financial security of disabled and special needs children. Phua also led a committee that drew up a five-year plan to improve services for special needs children. The PAP studied their proposals and later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit abuse of the mentally disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after <b>they</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ishigami {{played a}} large role in the {{implementation}} of the Wi-Fi rescue quests, and it went smoother than anticipated, something the developers attributed to their experience with developing mobile games. They were initially concerned about how the player loses all their items if <b>they</b> <b>die</b> during a rescue mission, but realized {{that it had to be}} that way to avoid people abusing rescue missions to get new items. Due to programming changes between the Japanese and the English versions of the game, rescue quests from the North American and European versions are only compatible with each other, and not with the Japanese release.|$|E
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; <b>they</b> <b>die</b> out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{is now in}} full flow with the gas affecting the townspeople's thinking. About half the town, including Frantz and Suzanne, talk revolution. Others give themselves to pleasure. Fritz and Suzel sing of making love until the day <b>they</b> <b>die.</b> The political agitators intend to overthrow the town council but Niklausse and Van Tricasse persuade them instead to attack a neighbouring town over an incident 700 years earlier involving a stray cow. Frantz is appointed the war leader for pledging to kill the most people.|$|E

5|$|The {{player has}} a number of lives upon {{starting}} the game, and should <b>they</b> <b>die</b> a gravestone will appear at their location and stay in place as long as the player has lives left. Health can be replenished by collecting food scattered throughout the castle, however it will constantly drop the more the player moves, thus the player may eventually lose a life from starvation if they have not escaped the castle in time.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of Singaporeans pre-booking niches at private crematoria, even though some people consider talking about death and pre-booking a final resting place inauspicious. Reasons for pre-booking include wanting one's ashes to be close to those of loved ones, and hedging against higher prices for niches in future. The bodies of foreigners (regardless of where <b>they</b> <b>die)</b> can be cremated in Singapore, but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria. There are also irregular instances of Singaporeans dying overseas, such as the 2015 accident surrounding Huang Lin Davina, a high-profile demise of a Singaporean abroad.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} species of Siricidae, the Sirex {{woodwasp}} can damage relatively healthy trees so heavily, <b>they</b> <b>die</b> back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need healthy wood, the Sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested.|$|E

5|$|Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni are {{a couple}} leading a miserable marital life due to several misunderstandings and decide to file for divorce. <b>They</b> <b>die</b> on 14 February 1983 at 10:20 AM near a clock tower {{on their way to}} the lawyer's office. Their son, Nageswara Rao, becomes a rich and {{influential}} businessman and happens to come across his parents' lookalikes, Nagarjuna and Priya. After befriending them, Rao decides to re-establish them as a couple but is shocked when Nagarjuna introduces his lover, Prema. Rao manages to dissolve the relationship with the help of his personal adviser, Girish Karnad. Unaware of this, Nagarjuna swears not to fall in love with anyone. At the same clock tower, Rao meets Dr. Anjali and falls in love with her at first sight. He helps her in admitting an injured old man to a nearby hospital and donates his blood. The injured man, Chaitanya, is shocked upon seeing the pair as they resemble his deceased parents, Seetharamudu and Ramalakshmi.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task is to go to a specific point to return to their normal form and transform another random player into the monkey. Players gain points by killing the monkey and lose points if <b>they</b> <b>die</b> as the monkey. The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, which is the same as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning player or team will have to face a new opponent. If the player or team loses, they will have to get in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags and return it to a team's base.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, {{and the majority of}} the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters. Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to a pillar of light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless <b>they</b> <b>die</b> or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the dungeon over at the beginning. When not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the dungeon itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position may be different, the number of floors can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item {{from the end of the}} dungeon.|$|E
