5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized {{now for the}} earlier adoption of Panama's penal system in the Zone.

The Chaplain–Medic massacre {{was one of the}} first to be investigated, and it was here that the incident got its name. Buttrey, the lone survivor of the executions, was called <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> committee, and the U.S. Government concluded that the North Korean army violated the terms of the Geneva Convention, and condemned its actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} at Hill 303 {{would be only}} one of {{the first of a series}} of atrocities the U.S. forces accused North Korean soldiers of committing. In late 1953 the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, conducted an investigation of up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War. The Hill 303 massacre was one of the first to be investigated.

5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but {{did not result in}} any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital. Taylor, recognizing that the slightest incident could lead to violence, ordered the men home, {{and many of them}} complied. Still, two or three hundred remained, awaiting the election committee's findings. Others remained as witnesses set <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> contest committee. Some of these Republican witnesses were arrested by local police, who were mostly Goebel partisans. Governor Taylor issued pardons for some of them, citing their claims that the police robbed them upon their arrest. To avoid arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, many of the Republican partisans began wearing their guns openly, adding to the tensions in the city, but effectively reducing the number of arrests by local police.|$|E

An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003, allegedly by stuffing the documents into his socks and pants. Berger subsequently lied to investigators when questioned about the removal of the documents.|$|R

5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1938, {{when there}} was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor {{practices}} by the studios against directors, Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios, alongside Darryl Zanuck and E. J. Mannix. Sitting across the table were W. S. Van Dyke, Howard Hawks, and Briskin's friend, Frank Capra. In 1939, Briskin was once again involved in potential legal proceedings, being {{one of a number of}} producers who were called <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> National Labor Relations Board, regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild (SWG). During the hearings, it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild. After the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia at the beginning of World War II, AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee, which was a sub-committee of the organization's Research Council. Headed by the council's chairman, Darryl F. Zanuck, Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee. The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production. In mid-November 1940 Briskin, along with the committee's chair Major Nathan Levinson, participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild, in order to select writers to go to Monmouth, New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films.|$|E

25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} pardoning Nixon contributed to President Ford’s loss {{of the presidential election}} of 1976. Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> House Judiciary Committee on October 17, 1974.|$|E
5000|$|The US District Court empaneled a {{grand jury}} to {{determine}} whether arson charges should be brought {{against some of the}} protesters on the suspicion that they may have intended to damage a police car by firing a bottle rocket under it, even though the only official damage reported was a broken tail light. The premise for Federal intervention in a case involving a city police car was that the car was funded in part by Federal dollars. Josh Wolf did not shoot any footage of the car incident. But because he shot other video footage elsewhere during the protest, and the identities of some of the protesters were allegedly known to him, Wolf was targeted by Federal officials. Wolf was subpoenaed by the court, requiring him to turn over his footage and submit <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> grand jury. Specifically, the FBI subpoenaed him to provide [...] "all documents, writings and recordings related to protest activities conducted in San Francisco" [...] between 6:30 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on July 8 as well any cameras, recording devices, and his computer.|$|R
