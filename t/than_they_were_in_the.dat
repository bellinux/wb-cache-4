Somewhere within these families, Eurytus and Cteatus were found in a form more fearsome <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Iliad: in the Catalogue they were fierce conjoined twins with two heads, four arms and an equal number of legs. Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son Thestius and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters Leda, Althaea and Hypermestra, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3–5.|$|E

The hurricane destroyed much of the infrastructure in Nicaragua, contributing to a recession that was already underway. The losses to cash crops severely reduced exports to under 200million dollars (1988USD). These factors combined to aggravate a recession and deepen the economic crisis.

Blainey concludes: [...] "As the standing of women was not high in Palestine, Jesus' kindnesses towards them were not always approved by those who strictly upheld tradition. According to Blainey, women were probably the majority of Christians in the first century after Christ.|$|E

2500|$|While {{differences}} in biblical interpretation or in calculation methodology can produce some {{differences in}} the creation date, most results fall relatively close {{to one of these}} two dominant models.

Most of the 1,732-year difference resides in numerical discrepancies in the genealogies of the two versions of the Book of Genesis. Patriarchs from Adam to Terah, the father of Abraham, are said to be older by as much as 100 years or more when they begat their named son in the Greek Septuagint <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin Vulgate ( [...] ; [...] ) or the Hebrew Tanakh ( [...] ; [...] ).

Liberarea Basarabiei, Marcel Mitrașcă argues, was one of the select few manifestations of Romanian national sentiment to advocate Bessarabian emancipation at the peak of wartime agitation, alongside similar manifestos by Stere, Axinte Frunză, Dumitru C. Moruzi etc. Arbore's political theory was later expanded into a Germanophile manifesto: Arbore claimed that Romania's only option was to rally with [...] "Russia's enemies" [...] on the Eastern Front, limiting European Russia to the [...] "ethnographic" [...] borders of ancient Muscovy; the alternative, he warned, was that the muscălime ("Moskals") would in the long run annex Romania and all her irredenta. Again, he described the Romanian prospects of [...] "liberating Bessarabia" [...] as intrinsically linked with the German-sponsored emancipation of Congress Poland, the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Ukraine. In an August 1915 piece for Seara, Arbore saluted the German people as the more [...] "enlightened" [...] combatant, who had accumulated a [...] "colossal vital energy" [...] and was therefore poised to emerge as the victor.|$|E

[...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier {{than it used to}} be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last war." [...] He continued, [...] "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made." [...] Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.|$|E

He also drew comparisons between Houston's influence and other big names' on 1980s pop:She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston’s voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.|$|E
