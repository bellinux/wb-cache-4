25|$|The Amerithrax {{investigation}} involved many leads {{which took}} time to evaluate and resolve. Among them were numerous letters which initially appeared {{to be related to}} <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> attacks but were never directly linked to <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> attacks.|$|E
25|$|Congressman Rush Holt, whose {{district}} in New Jersey includes a mailbox from which anthrax letters {{are believed to}} have been mailed, called for an investigation of <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> attacks by Congress or by an independent commission he proposed in a bill entitled <b>the</b> <b>Anthrax</b> Attacks Investigation Act (H.R. 1248) Other members of Congress have also called for an independent investigation.|$|E

50|$|On March 28, 2005, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Taha had provided {{an explanation for}} the 1,800 gallon discrepancy between <b>the</b> amount of <b>anthrax</b> <b>the</b> UN knew she had manufactured, and the amount she admitted to destroying. <b>The</b> missing <b>anthrax</b> was one of the stated reasons for the Iraq war and was emphasized by then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell during his February 2003 speech to the Security Council. However, according to an Iraq Survey Group report published on October 6, 2004, Taha told American investigators that she and her colleagues dumped <b>the</b> missing <b>anthrax</b> near <b>the</b> gates of one of Saddam's palaces in April 1991, but were afraid to admit to this for fear of incurring Saddam's wrath. The Iraqi biologists therefore told the UN weapons inspectors that <b>the</b> missing <b>anthrax</b> had never existed.|$|R

50|$|He {{was serving}} as mayor during <b>the</b> 2001 <b>anthrax</b> attacks when <b>the</b> {{regional}} postal facility {{located in the}} community received and distributed anthrax-tainted letters. Gilmore was featured in TIME magazine for having established an emergency treatment clinic to care for more than 1,000 postal workers who {{had been exposed to}} <b>the</b> potentially-deadly <b>anthrax</b> substance.|$|R
50|$|He was in {{the lead}} vocalist/rhythm guitarist for the band BlackGates, as well as ex lead vocalist of American thrash metal band Anthrax from 2007 to 2009. He was <b>the</b> first <b>Anthrax</b> vocalist to perform with the band in Korea, Colombia, and Estonia.

5000|$|French {{physician}} Casimir Davaine (1812-1882) demonstrated <b>the</b> {{symptoms of}} <b>anthrax</b> were invariably {{accompanied by the}} microbe B. anthracis. [...] German physician Aloys Pollender (1799-1879) is credited for discovery. B. anthracis was the first bacterium conclusively demonstrated to cause disease, by Robert Koch in 1876. The species name anthracis is from <b>the</b> Greek <b>anthrax</b> (ἄνθραξ), meaning [...] "coal" [...] and referring to {{the most common form}} of <b>the</b> disease, cutaneous <b>anthrax,</b> in which large, black skin lesions are formed.Throughout <b>the</b> 19th century, <b>Anthrax</b> was an infection that involved several very important medical developments. The first vaccine containing live organisms was Louis Pasteur's veterinary anthrax vaccine.|$|R
25|$|When the U.S. {{military}} began requiring {{its troops}} to receive <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> vaccine, multiple US military troops {{refused to do}} so, which led to threats of military courts martial.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the report}} on the Amerithrax {{investigation}} published by the Department of Justice, Ivins engaged in actions and made statements that indicate a consciousness of guilt. He took environmental samples in his laboratory without authorization and decontaminated areas {{in which he had}} worked without reporting his activities. He also threw away a book about secret codes, which described methods similar to those used in <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> letters. Ivins threatened other scientists, made equivocal statements about his possible involvement in a conversation with an acquaintance, and put together outlandish theories in an effort to shift the blame for <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> mailings to people close to him.|$|E
25|$|If the 9/11 hijackers were {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> attacks they would probably have needed an accomplice to mail the tainted letters since the four recovered anthrax letters were postmarked on September 18 and October 9.|$|E

25|$|In the {{preparation}} for the 1990 Persian Gulf campaign, whole cell pertussis vaccine {{was used as an}} adjuvant for anthrax vaccine. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> vaccine, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Henry S. Heine, a {{microbiologist}} who was Ivins' fellow {{researcher at}} the Army Medical Research Institute, told a National Academy of Sciences panel on April 22, 2010 that he considered it impossible that Ivins could have produced <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> used in the attacks without detection.|$|E

25|$|As discussed, each {{molecule}} {{interacts with}} several others {{in order to}} induce the endocytosis of <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> toxin. Once inside, the complex is transferred to an acidic compartment, where the heptamer, still in the non-membrane-spanning pre-pore conformation, is prepared for translocation of EF and LF into the cytosol.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, an {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{as a result of}} an incident at Fort Detrick where anthrax spores had escaped carefully guarded rooms into the building's unprotected areas.

25|$|Pasteur {{publicly}} {{claimed his}} success in developing <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> vaccine in 1881. However, his admirer-turned-rival Toussaint {{was the one who}} developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named Pasteurella in honour of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works. On July 12, 1880, Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep. Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881. Pasteur gave a misleading account of the preparation of <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> vaccine used in the experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort. He used potassium dichromate to prepare the vaccine. The promotional experiment was a success and helped Pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.|$|E

25|$|The {{first set}} of anthrax letters were postmarked September 18, 2001, exactly {{one week after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks. Five letters are {{believed}} to have been mailed at this time, to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the New York Post, all in New York City; and the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc. (AMI) in Boca Raton, Florida. AMI also publishes a tabloid called Sun where Robert Stevens, the first person who died from the mailings, worked. Only the New York Post and NBC News letters were actually found; the existence of the other three letters is inferred from the pattern of infection. <b>The</b> <b>anthrax</b> found in the New York Post letter is reported to have become damp before being discovered. Scientists examining <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> from the New York Post letter said it appeared as a coarse brown granular material looking like Purina Dog Chow.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of the FBI's investigation, Don Foster, a {{professor}} of English at Vassar College, attempted to connect <b>the</b> <b>anthrax</b> letters and various hoax letters from the same period to Steven Hatfill.
