5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning <b>the</b> <b>boulder,</b> or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding <b>the</b> <b>boulder</b> can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near <b>the</b> <b>boulder</b> in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up <b>the</b> <b>boulder.</b> Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|Basin rests above <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> Batholith, {{the host}} rock for many {{valuable}} mineral ores {{found in this}} part of Montana. After the town became a hub of gold and silver mining, Basin's population peaked at about 1,500 in first decade of the 20th century but gradually declined as the mines were depleted. Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the ruins of a smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21stcentury.|$|E
30|$|We {{assumed that}} <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> were transported in rolling mode. However, if <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> were transported in sliding mode, the {{required}} wave heights to move <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> would be smaller {{than those with}} a return period of 50  years (Table  2). This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> could be moved by the small amplitude waves that have a return period of 50  years or less if <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> were moved in sliding mode. In any case, <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> could be transported by the storm waves with a return period of 50  years or less.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{controversy}} concerning the ringing ability of <b>the</b> <b>boulders,</b> conversely there {{has been a}}n almost complete lack of testing to support the conjectures. Conditions such as size and shape of <b>the</b> <b>boulders,</b> and <b>the</b> way that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> are supported or stacked certainly influences the sounds that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> make, but do not in themselves impart the ringing ability.|$|R

5|$|Monument 15 {{is a large}} boulder with an Olmec-style relief {{sculpture}} of the head, shoulders and arms of an anthropomorphic figure emerging from a shallow niche, the arms bent inwards at the elbow. The back of <b>the</b> <b>boulder</b> is carved with the hindquarters of a feline, probably a jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{a history}} of alpine {{glaciation}} that is most obvious in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while none have been mapped elsewhere on the forest, some may still exist in <b>the</b> <b>Boulder,</b> Pioneer, and White Cloud Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Basin area is {{underlain}} by {{the quartz}} monzonite of <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> Batholith. The batholith is overlain by dacite from the Paleogene and Neogene periods (roughly 66million to 1.8million years ago) and andesite {{from the late}} Cretaceous. The andesite and monzonite are cut by dikes of dacite and rhyolite.|$|E
30|$|If the {{evidence}} regarding tsunamis in folklore or historical documents is reliable, {{it appears that}} <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> in this region were moved by past tsunamis. However, we have no data to suggest that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> on Lanyu Island were transported by tsunamis. Thus, we conclude that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> were moved by storm waves, particularly those associated with typhoons. Based on the numerical simulation, <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> {{could not have been}} moved by the tsunamis, but instead could have been moved by storm waves. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> moved by tsunamis would be relocated by storm waves, if the runup heights of the tsunamis were less than 10 to 15  m, which is almost equal to that of the computed tsunamis.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 and 2007, Alexey Rubtsov started {{climbing}} in the Russian championships. In 2008, {{he entered}} {{two stages of}} <b>the</b> <b>bouldering</b> World Cup. In 2009, he participated in <b>the</b> <b>bouldering</b> World Championships again and won over Rustam Gelmanov and David Barrans. Over the next two years, he participated in several stages of <b>the</b> <b>bouldering</b> World Cup, finishing third in Sheffield and Munich in 2011.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>boulders</b> at Jiupeng are {{distributed}} at distances of 30 to 76  m {{from the shore}} (Matta et al. 2013). Boulder sizes {{were found to be}} in the range 4.2 to 5.5  m, which is within <b>the</b> range of <b>boulder</b> sizes observed on Lanyu Island. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> at Jiupeng would have been moved by storm waves. Even if <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> were transported to the coast by paleo-tsunamis, subsequent storms would have moved them.|$|R
5|$|To prevent injuries, boulderers {{position}} crash pads near <b>the</b> <b>boulder</b> {{to provide}} a softer landing, {{as well as one}} or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures, and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.|$|E
5|$|After two of Flagg's {{followers}} fail to {{kill the}} leaders of the Free Zone, <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> community sends a group of men to Las Vegas to stop him. The three who reach the city are taken prisoner, and Flagg orders one of them executed for his defiance. As the other two are being prepared for a public execution, one of Flagg's most loyal followers, the Trashcan Man, arrives with a nuclear warhead salvaged from a military base. As Trash dies of radiation poisoning the Hand of God appears, detonating the warhead and annihilating Flagg, his followers, and the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman did his {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review {{on the grounds that}} the nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture. On appeal, the thesis was reviewed and accepted for publication.|$|E
30|$|The {{estimated}} maximum flow velocities {{obtained from}} numerical simulations of storm waves were larger than required to initiate movement of <b>the</b> <b>boulders.</b> This {{also suggests that}} <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> would have been moved by storm waves with a 50 -year return period.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boulders</b> at Santee {{have been}} climbed for decades, even though <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> {{themselves}} {{are located on}} private land. The Access Fund {{has been able to}} work with the owners in keeping this popular bouldering site open to the public.|$|R
50|$|Both teams play at once. A volcano {{center stage}} erupts yellow and blue <b>boulders.</b> <b>The</b> {{children}} have to grab <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> {{and place them in}} their respective holders while the adults have to grab <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> and throw them back inside the volcano. The children score 10 points per <b>boulder</b> in <b>the</b> holder. Time limit is 60 seconds.|$|R
5|$|In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency {{added the}} Basin mining {{area to the}} Superfund National Priorities List because of mining-waste {{problems}} in and near town. The mining area comprised the watersheds of Basin and Cataract Creek and part of <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> River. Contaminants included arsenic, copper, cadmium, lead and other metals. Cleanup of the mining wastes at the Buckeye-Enterprise, Crystal and Bullion mines in the Basin Creek and Cataract watersheds was completed in 2002, {{and the removal of}} mine waste from Basin was completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Movies, {{television}} shows, and documentaries {{have been}} filmed {{in and around}} Sawtooth National Forest, particularly around the Sun Valley area. Movies filmed in Sun Valley include I Met Him in Paris (1937), Sun Valley Serenade (1941), and Bus Stop (1956). Clint Eastwood's 1985 film Pale Rider was filmed in the SNRA, mostly in <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> Mountains in late 1984. The opening credits scene was shot south of Stanley {{in front of the}} Sawtooth Mountains. The SNRA was one of the settings of the 2010 3-D computer animated film Alpha and Omega.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1928 President Coolidge {{signed the}} bill authorizing the dam. <b>The</b> <b>Boulder</b> Canyon Project Act {{appropriated}} $165million for the Hoover Dam {{along with the}} downstream Imperial Dam and All-American Canal, a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border. It also permitted the compact {{to go into effect}} when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.|$|E

5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} wapiti), mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the Sawtooth Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to motorized use to protect the elk winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in <b>the</b> <b>Boulder,</b> White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the coyote, moose, bobcat, beaver, yellow-bellied marmot, pika, and badger.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 general election, Gibbs faced Republican Don Ytterberg, {{whom he had}} outraised roughly $80,000 to $50,000 by mid-October. Gibbs cited his {{track record}} of passing {{legislation}} and his connections and experience {{at the state capitol}} as part of his case for re-election, and named wildfire and business concerns as his major priorities for a continued term in the Colorado Senate. He also called for reducing business personal property taxes and growing local small businesses. Gibbs' re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, the Summit Daily News, and <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> Daily Camera, the Arvada Press, and the Golden Transcript. Gibbs raised over $100,000 during his campaign to Ytterberg's $60,000, and ultimately won re-election with about 59 percent of the vote, taking three-quarters of votes cast in Summit County, but losing narrowly to Ytterberg in suburban Jefferson County.|$|E
5|$|On September30, 1935, the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) {{completed}} Hoover Dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. Behind the dam rose Lake Mead, {{the largest}} artificial {{lake in the}} U.S., capable of holding {{more than two years}} of the Colorado's flow. The construction of Hoover was a major step towards stabilizing the lower channel of the Colorado River, storing water for irrigation in times of drought, and providing much-needed flood control as part of a program known as <b>the</b> <b>Boulder</b> Canyon Project. Hoover was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction and also had the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Flow regulation from Hoover Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River; Imperial and Parker dams followed in 1938, and Davis Dam was completed in 1950.|$|E
5000|$|All of the {{observed}} ringing rock boulder fields in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey are a form of felsenmeer. Felsenmeer is a German term meaning [...] "sea of rock". These barren block fields occur in periglacial environments where outcrops of resistant rock are exposed with a slope of less than 25°. Frost wedging breaks up the upper portion of the rock formation, and the slight dip of the field allows the fine weathering materials to be flushed away before soil can develop. Often <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> are lifted and rotated by the accumulation of snow and ice, leaving {{a considerable amount of}} vacant space between them. <b>The</b> felsenmeer <b>boulder</b> fields form in-situ due to the low slope angles. In situations where the slope angles are steeper than 25°.gravity tends to move <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> downhill to form scree or talus slopes. In fields where the angle is too flat the spaces between <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> fills with soil and <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> break down due to weathering.|$|R

5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of <b>the</b> <b>boulder,</b> give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E
5|$|Two years {{following}} Gruntilda's first defeat by Banjo and Kazooie, {{the two are}} playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles in Banjo's house. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1, and destroy <b>the</b> <b>boulder</b> trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda down {{and put an end}} to her plans.|$|E
5|$|The only {{video game}} based {{exclusively}} on the film is Raiders of the Lost Ark, released in 1982 by Atari for their Atari 2600 console. The first third of the video game Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, released in 1994 by JVC for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System, is based entirely on the film. Several of the film's sequences are reproduced (<b>the</b> <b>boulder</b> run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several inconsistencies with the film {{are present in the}} game, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present in the Well of Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by LucasArts and Factor 5. In the 1999 game Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, a bonus level brings Jones back to the Peruvian temple of the film's opening scene. In 2008, to coincide with the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Lego released the Lego Indiana Jones line—which included building sets based on Raiders of the Lost Ark—and LucasArts published a video game based on the toyline, , which was developed by Traveller's Tales.|$|E
50|$|A {{replica of}} <b>the</b> Ontonagon <b>Boulder</b> {{can be found}} at the Ontonagon Historical Museum. While various numbers are given for <b>the</b> <b>boulder's</b> weight, <b>the</b> most {{commonly}} accepted figure is 3,708 pounds.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> Silurian {{greywacke}} <b>boulders</b> at <b>the</b> site are {{perched on}} pedestals of limestone up to 30cm high. <b>The</b> <b>boulders</b> were probably deposited by melting ice sheets {{at the end}} of the last ice age, around 12,000 years ago. The pedestals have developed because <b>the</b> erratic <b>boulders</b> have protected <b>the</b> underlying limestone from solution by rainfall, giving estimates of the rate of lowering of the surrounding limestone pavement of around 25mm per 1000 years. Recent cosmogenic dating suggests that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> have been exposed for around 17,900 years.|$|R
