While this operation ended late in December and the Partisans once again survived, the cost was high. The Partisans suffered about 2,000 additional casualties. Though badly battered, the majority of the Partisan units retained their cohesion. Tito's army could still be considered an effective fighting force.|$|R

5000|$|Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion sequence—also called TRAP sequence, TRAPS, or acardiac twinning—is a rare {{complication}} of monochorionic twin pregnancies. It is a severe variant of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The twins' blood systems are connected instead of independent. One twin, called the acardiac twin or TRAP fetus, is severely malformed. The heart is missing or deformed, {{hence the name}} acardiac, as are the upper structures of the body [...] The legs may be partially present or missing, and internal structures of the torso are often poorly formed. The other twin is usually normal in appearance. The normal twin, called the pump <b>twin,</b> <b>drives</b> blood through both fetuses. It is called reversed arterial perfusion because in the acardiac twin the blood flows in a reversed direction.|$|R
