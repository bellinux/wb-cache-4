5|$|Antibodies {{are heavy}} (~150kDa) {{globular}} plasma proteins. They have sugar chains (glycans) added to conserved amino acid residues. In other words, antibodies are glycoproteins. The attached glycans are critically important to <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> {{function of the}} antibody. Among other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody's affinity for its corresponding FcR(s).|$|E

The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction.

5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within <b>the</b> <b>structure,</b> <b>and</b> which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E
