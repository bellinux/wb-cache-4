When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and that there is nothing {{that can be done to}} prevent it. Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>and</b> so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E

500|$|Krumwiede is {{an ardent}} {{conspiracy}} theorist who, according to Law, {{is the so-called}} index patient for [...] "what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic". [...] "We definitely wanted {{him to have a}} messianic streak", said Soderbergh, whom Law talked to during the character's creating process. The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti-government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that [...] "what's interesting is that you're not really sure about him. Is the government really hiding something and does the herbal remedy he's talking about really work? I think we all suspect {{at one time or another}} that we're not getting <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth,</b> <b>and</b> in that sense Krumwiede represents the audience's point of view." ...|$|E
