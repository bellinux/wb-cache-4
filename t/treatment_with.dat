40|$|Background: Dose- {{response}} {{studies is}} requested for pharmaceuticals, {{but has not}} been the task for manual therapy. Aim: Determine the combination of treatment numbers and intervals obtaining optimal effect of osteopathic <b>treatment</b> in patients <b>with</b> long-lasting unspecific low back pain. Material and Methods: Eight women and four men with long lasting low back pain were included. The study was performed as an open, randomized, single centre trial with 22 factorial design. The patients were allocated equally to 4 groups by block randomization. The first group was given 2 <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 14 days interval, the second 2 with 7 days interval, the third 4 <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 14 days interval and the fourth 4 <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 7 days interval. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) were recorded at baseline and 2 weeks post treatment. Results: Two <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 14 days interval resulted in ODI reduction of only 1. 3 (95 % CI: - 21 – 24. 1). The largest reduction in ODI was detected for four <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 7 days intervals. The mean reduction in this group was found to be 19. 3 (95 % CI: - 14. 4 – 53. 1). An interaction between number of treatments and the treatment interval was demonstrated. Conclusion: The effect increased with increasing number of treatment and reduced treatment interval. Four <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 7 days intervals were the superior of the four chosen regimens. An interaction between number and treatment interval was detected...|$|R

5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if the <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> {{two different}} antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E

40|$|How do outside options affect cooperation?

We find that <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> high barriers to exit generate higher welfare overall as they foster stability and prevent inefficient separation of pairs. There is excessive exit in <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> low barriers to exit, driven in part by an overestimate of the likelihood that the peer will leave and a desire not to be left alone in the public project. We contrast long-term “strategic” and short-term “egoistic” drivers of exit and find that short-term cost-benefit considerations play a more important role in <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> lower barriers to exit...|$|R
40|$|Pathogen {{detection}} {{in foods}} by reliable methodologies {{is very important}} to guarantee microbilogical safety. However, peculiar characteristics of certain foods, such as autochthonous microbiota, can directly influence pathogen development and detection. With the objective of verifying the performance of the official analytical methodologies for the isolation of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella in milk, different concentrations of these pathogens were inoculated in raw milk <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> different levels of mesophilic aerobes, and then submitted to the traditional isolation procedures for the inoculated pathogens. Listeria monocytogenes was inoculated at the range of 0. 2 - 5. 2 log CFU/mL in <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 1. 8 - 8. 2 log CFU/mL. Salmonella Enteritidis was inoculated at 0. 9 - 3. 9 log CFU/mL in <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> 3. 0 - 8. 2 log CFU/mL. The results indicated that recovery was not possible or was more difficult in the <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> high counts of mesophilic aerobes and low levels of the pathogens, indicating interference of raw milk autochthonous microbiota. This interference was more evident for L. monocytogenes, once the pathogen recovery was not possible in <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> mesophilic aerobes up to 4. 0 log CFU/mL and inoculum under 2. 0 log CFU/mL. For S. Enteritidis the interference appeared to be more non-specific. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved. FAPESP[01 / 13076 - 8...|$|R

40|$|Seed {{and leaf}} <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> natural {{compounds}} having a low risk profile (LRP) were evaluated for their potential to induce resistance in cabbage plants (Brassica oleracea) against Peronospora parasitica, causal organism of downy mildew. The selection of 34 LRP compounds comprised micronutrients, organic compounds such as proline, riboflavin, oligogalacturonides, aminolignosulfonates, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and bacterial and fungal extracts. <b>Treatments</b> <b>with</b> the synthetic chemical inducers 2, 6 -dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), d,l-ß-aminobutyric acid, salicylic acid, benzothiadiazole and the fungicide Previcur™ were included as controls. After seed treatment a maximum reduction of 27 % diseased leaf area {{was found with}} an extract of a Lysobacter strain, compared to a reduction of 99 % for INA, the most effective synthetic inducer. Seed <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> extracts of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, Bacillus macerans, Pseudomonas syringae, Streptomyces and Xanthomonas campestris strains also reduced downy mildew infection significantly. After leaf treatment, a maximum reduction of 85 % was again found with the Lysobacter extract, compared to a reduction of 99 % for INA, the most effective synthetic inducer. Leaf <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> CuSO 4 (= 1 mM), MnCl 2 (= 10 mM), K 2 HPO 4 (100 mM), and extracts of P. syringae, P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, Streptomyces, X. campestris and B. macerans strains also reduced the diseased leaf area, but CuSO 4 was highly phytotoxic. For seed and leaf <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> Lysobacter extract, proline, MnCl 2 and INA {{the effect on the}} induction of chitinase and glucanase activity was tested, using two pathogenesis-related proteins as markers for induced resistance. For seed treatments only INA and for leaf treatments INA, proline and MnCl 2 treatments resulted in increased activity of both enzymes.
