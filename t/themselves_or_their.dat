The boats however had been sent without necessary maintenance of the boats <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> engines.

5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{that life is}} a right {{and that the government}} will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows for the death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to testify against <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E
5|$|In a rare move, District Judge Earnest Lau {{released}} a 14-page judgment explaining the court's denial of Odex's request for Pacific Internet's client information. He compared Odex's demands to an Anton Piller order, which {{provides for the}} right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. Seen as draconian, it is only used under extreme circumstances. He held that only copyright holders <b>themselves,</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> exclusive licensees, can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders. Out of all the anime licensed to Odex, only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company. The judge noted that, out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court, ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS), not Odex, to act for the copyright holders. Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$7,000.|$|E

25|$|It was {{becoming}} apparent, {{by the fall}} of 1942, that Prince David and her sister ships were not equipped to defend <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> charges against well-armed enemy ships that, it was feared, may begin to operate off the West Coast. It was therefore decided to convert Prince David and Prince Henry to landing ships infantry (medium) in preparation for the coming invasion of Europe.|$|E
25|$|The famine {{led to a}} stark {{increase}} in crime, even among those not normally inclined to criminal activity, because people would resort to any means to feed <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> family. For the next several decades, after the famine, Europe took on a tougher and more violent edge; it became an even less amicable place than during the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. This could be seen across all segments of society, perhaps most strikingly in the way warfare was conducted in the fourteenth century during the Hundred Years' War, when chivalry ended, {{as opposed to the}} twelfth and the thirteenth centuries when nobles were more likely to die by accident in tournament games than on the field of battle.|$|E

25|$|Other points used {{to support}} the Black Hypothesis {{included}} testing melanin levels in {{a small sample of}} mummies, arguing that the ancient Egyptian language was related to Diop's native Wolof (Senegal), interpretations of the origin of the name Kmt, conventionally pronounced Kemet, used by the ancient Egyptians to describe <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> land (depending on points of view), biblical traditions, and interpretations of the depictions of the Egyptians in numerous paintings and statues. Other points of the hypothesis include claimed cultural affiliations, such as circumcision, matriarchy, totemism, hair braiding, head binding, and kingship cults. Artifacts found at Qustul (near Abu Simbel – Modern Sudan) in 1960–64 were seen as showing that ancient Egypt and A-group Nubia shared the same culture and were part of the greater Nile Valley sub-stratum, but more recent finds in Egypt indicate that the Qustul rulers probably adopted/emulated the symbols of Egyptian pharaohs.|$|E
25|$|Some chiropractors oppose {{vaccination}} {{and water}} fluoridation, which are common public health practices. Within the chiropractic community {{there are significant}} disagreements about vaccination, {{one of the most}} cost-effective public health interventions available. Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects, claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary. Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but {{a significant portion of the}} profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing. The extent to which anti-vaccination views perpetuate the current chiropractic profession is uncertain. The American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease. The Canadian Chiropractic Association supports vaccination; a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> children.|$|E
25|$|Unlike earlier {{waterfront}} strikes, longshoremen were {{prevented from}} picketing the docks to discourage strikebreaking, {{and claimed that}} they were going to go en masse to talk to the non-union workers. They were led by Victoria Cross recipient Mickey O'Rourke and a contingent of First World War veterans and marched behind a Union Jack flag, to great symbolic effect. At the entrance to the pier, they were met by Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster, who warned the demonstrators that they would not be permitted to proceed. When they refused to turn back, protesters were attacked with clubs by the police guarding the pier. Within minutes, more police joined in the fight. In addition to the Vancouver city police, contingents from the British Columbia Provincial Police, who had been hiding behind boxcars, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, engaged with demonstrators. The police chased the dispersing crowd, continuing to club people even as they fled and fired tear gas. Many protesters fought back, throwing rocks and other projectiles at the police, while others that were attacked were simply trying to flee the scene. The ensuing melee continued for three hours and spread throughout the nearby residential district. Several people, both police and protesters, were hospitalized as a result of the riot, and one bystander was shot in the back of his legs by a police shotgun. Offices of Communist organizers and the longshoremen's union were also raided, with tear gas shot through the windows to drive out any occupants before the police entered. Strike supporters set up a makeshift hospital at the Ukrainian Hall, and the police did the same for their wounded at the Coroner's Court on Cordova Street. In total, 28 out of the 60 injured were hospitalized and 24 men were arrested. Mayor Gerry McGeer declared that striking longshoremen would no longer be eligible for relief payments for <b>themselves</b> <b>or</b> <b>their</b> families.|$|E
