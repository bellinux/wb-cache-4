40|$|A new neural network-based run-to-run {{process control}} system (NNRtRC) is {{proposed}} in this article. The key characteristic of this NNRtRC is that the linear and stationary process estimator and controller in the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) run-to-run control scheme are replaced by two multilayer feed-forward neural networks. An efficient learning algorithm inspired by the sliding mode control law is suggested for the neural network-based run-to-run controller.

40|$|The crop-livestock {{integrated}} farming system practiced in most developing countries depends {{to a greater}} extent on the ecosystem as a whole. The importance of animals as an agent of nutrient recycle, sources of rural energy in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> power and fuel as well as major contributor of the farm economy, has resulted into increased population of ruminant stock in these regions creating threats to the sustainability and productivity of land resources. This case-study research attempted to formulate optimum herd size compatible to different resource holding farm categories within the sub watershed in mid hills region of Nepal. The research was conducted by classified data collection in Nepal and analysis using Linear Programming (LP) techniques. The LP analysis revealed that the farmers of large, medium and small categories of farms can optimize their livestock holding with combination of 3 Livestock Units (LU) buffaloes and 4 LU goats, 2 LU buffaloes and 4 LU goats and 1 LU buffaloes and 4. 4 LU goats with maximum return to the farm family without exerting pressure on the fragile natural resources...|$|E
40|$|Scouting is a {{major part}} of talent {{acquisition}} for any professional sports team. In the National Hockey League (NHL), the market for scouting is set by the NHLs Central Scouting Service which develops a ranking of draft eligible players. In addition to the Central Scouting rankings, NHL teams use their own internal scouting to augment their knowledge of eligible players and develop their own rankings. Using a novel statistical approach we show in this paper that the additional information possessed by teams provides better rankings than those of Central Scouting. Using data from the 1998 to 2002 NHL drafts, we estimate that the average yearly gain per team from their internal scouting is between 1. 8 MM and 5. 2 MM. These values are consistent across the three measures of player productivity that we consider: cumulative Games Played, cumulative Time On Ice and cumulative Goals Versus Threshold where we have aggregated these metrics across the first seven years post draft. We used this time frame since teams generally retain rights to their draft picks for seven years. Further, we find that no individual team outperformed the others in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> performance. One byproduct of our analysis is the development of a Draft Value Pick Chart to assess the worth of an individual selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis, bearing the title "The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness (rigor cambii) in {{the perspective of}} Czech substantive and procedural law", is to analyze the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness {{as well as to}} consider its influence on chosen institutes <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> law. The reason to choose such topic for my thesis is my deep interest in this area of law, thanks to its precise regulation and rich history of evolvement <b>of</b> individual <b>draft</b> institutes. The paper is divided into five parts, where the introductory part is followed by three major chapters and the conclusion. The first of the chapters is called The Draft rigorousness, the second The <b>Term</b> <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness and the third The Individual categories <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness.

The second chapter of my thesis focuses on the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness itself and attempts to define its substantiality.

40|$|This paper {{reveals the}} scope for {{utilization}} of biodiesel blends with petrol diesel in agricultural tractor for tillage operations {{for addressing the}} problem of fuel crisis. The blends were prepared on volume basis in proportions of 20 : 80, 40 : 60, 60 : 40 and designated as B 20, B 40, B 60 respectively and their physico-chemical properties were determined/measured and compared with petro-diesel (B 0). The performance of agricultural tractor in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>draft,</b> drawbar power, fuel consumption and fuel efficiency were assessed following the RNAM test codes and the exhaust emission of the tractor was also analysed using exhaust gas analyzer at three selected forward speeds viz., 2. 5, 3. 5 and 4. 5 km h- 1 during tillage operations. The results revealed that the specific draft and drawbar power of tractor were not affected by the blends but significantly affected by forward speed. However, the fuel consumption and fuel efficiency were affected significantly by both the blends and forward speed of operation. The rate of increase in the emission levels of CO and NOX were the direct function of forward speed. The emission level of CO decreased with the blends of biodiesel while, the NOX emissions increased {{with the increase in}} biodiesel blends.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Vibrating a tillage tool is an {{effective}} way <b>of</b> reducing the <b>draft</b> force required to pull it through the soil. The degree <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> force reduction {{is dependent on the}} combination of operating parameters and soil conditions. It is thus necessary to optimize the vibratory implement for different conditions. Numerical modelling is more flexible than experimental testing and analytical models, and less costly than experimental testing. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was specifically developed for granular materials such as soils and can be used to model a vibrating tillage tool for its design and optimization. The goal was thus to evaluate the ability of DEM to model a vibratory subsoiler and to investigate the cause <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> force reduction. The DEM model was evaluated against data obtained from field testing done with a full scale single tine vibratory subsoiler. Soil testing was also done for material characterization and for the calibration of DEM material properties. The subsoiler was simulated using a commercial code, PFC 3 D. The effect on the simulation results of particle diameter, different bonding models and damping models was investigated. The final simulations were evaluated against the experimental results in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> force and material behaviour. The cause <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> force reduction due to vibration was also investigated with the aid of the DEM model. From the results it was concluded that DEM is able to model the vibratory subsoiler for its design and optimization. The DEM model also provided valuable insight into the cause <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> force reduction such as the increased peak stresses due to vibration and the increase in particle kinetic energy...|$|R
