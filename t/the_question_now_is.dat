6000|$|... "I {{tell your}} reverence," [...] said Sir Peregrine, [...] "crooked stick though they term him, I had ten times rather have the dealing with him than with those comely great lubbers his brothers! <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> shall I {{tell him what}} is in store for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{cannot be}} the least doubt {{that he would have}} made a murderous attack upon me. It is, however, a game at which two may play. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> whether we should take a {{premature}} lunch here, or run our chance of starving before we reach the buffet at Newhaven." ...|$|E
5000|$|Glasgow Warriors thus {{qualified}} for a European Champions Cup Quarter Final {{for the first}} time in their history. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was...</b> could they go even further? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{what would}} be their next move? A great stir among the {{shipping}} seemed to indicate an expedition by water. But whither? Circumstances occurred to perplex <b>the</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{should he}} return to Slocum's office or seek outside assistance? He decided upon the latter course. To {{attempt to bring}} the rascally real estate agent to terms alone would be foolhardy.|$|R
6000|$|... "The wicked {{creature}} {{will never}} bother us again," [...] said the King. [...] "Yet {{it was only}} by accident we {{found a way to}} destroy it. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> what shall we do with this long, thin Dragon? If we leave it here it will trip any one who stumbles against it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{difficulty}} {{is the more}} formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> what shall we do with this poor wretch's body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} know all that. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{what can we do}} to help her? She is living now at this present moment, an orderly, sober life; but without occupation, or means, or friends. Will your wife let her come to her,--for a month or so, just to try her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes of}} {{struggling}} {{in the current}} found him safe on the opposite shore to that upon which the lower portion of the trail to Chilkoot Pass lay. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> how {{to get back to}} the other side of the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear lord," [...] said Mr. Camperdown, [...] "I shall wash {{my hands}} of the matter altogether. The {{diamonds}} <b>are</b> gone, and <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>now</b> <b>are,</b> who stole them, and where are they? In our business we can't meddle with such questions as those." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> how to {{get down}} the trees, or {{how to get}} his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the {{thinnest}} ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, {{merely an}} exaggeration of scenes that must often have {{happened}} before. But <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{whether you think}} there is any immediate danger of her husband's death; for in that case, I think, from what I have observed of her feelings, she would be pained afterwards to have been kept in ignorance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see might {{is right}} upon the waters,' he explained, {{with a smile}} which broke his whole face up into crinkles. 'I am an old soldier, a tough {{fighting}} man, and you are two raw lads. I have a knife, and you are unarmed. D'ye see the line of argument? <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> Where are we to go?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{somewhat}} lucky {{for all these}} people," [...] Ned said to himself, [...] "that I happened to fall in with Mynheer Genet. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> how to warn them. I see there are three orders of arrest against people here, and ten names on the suspected list. At any rate I can warn them myself." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the trade}} Jazz had an up tempo team which {{led them to}} long winning streaks along with moving up the western conference standings. As a result, the Jazz had {{virtually}} clinched a spot in for <b>the</b> playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> which spot they would clinch.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> how to {{get down}} the trees, or {{how to get}} his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the {{thinnest}} ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple [hesitate] to ram them down with poles.|$|R
5000|$|... "Finally, Mozilla had {{a product}} that could compete with Microsoft. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> how to {{publicize}} it. Open-source management seemed to work well {{when it came to}} developing software. But open-source marketing was an unexplored concept. Would people be willing to volunteer {{to get the word out}} on Firefox? Baker thought they might, and one reason was Asa Dotzler." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{which of}} us two has mistaken it; {{and if it}} appear I have not, the world will suspect, [...] "what gentleman that was, who was allowed to speak twice in parliament, because {{he had not yet}} spoken to the question[A];" [...] and perhaps {{conclude}} it to be the same, who, as it is reported, maintained a contradiction in terminis, in the face of three hundred persons.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} for another kingdom be the pasty which should {{encounter}} thee {{after such a}} vigil," [...] said the King; [...] "but <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> not of thy dinner, but of my own. I admit to my table this day, and in strict privacy, the Cardinal Balue and this Burgundian--this Count de Crevecoeur--and something may chance; the devil is most busy when foes meet on terms of truce." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} a serious {{imputation}} upon the prudence of my friend, to have made even such trivial sacrifices {{as it was in}} his power to make for principles which he did not truly embrace or did not perfectly understand. In either case the folly would have been great. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> whether, when he first practically professed Whig principles, he understood what principles he professed, and whether in his book he has faithfully expressed them.|$|E
60|$|He had failed, that <b>was</b> evident. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{how to save}} himself. With a sudden, catlike {{movement}} he whirled over on his back, {{caught his}} heel in a tiny, saucer-shaped depression and sat up. Then his courage failed him. Day had at last penetrated {{to the floor of}} the valley, and he was appalled at the frightful distance.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{should she}} return again to Mrs. Wace, {{in the village}} of Lower Wessex, or wait in the town at which she had arrived. She would have {{preferred}} to go back, but the distance was too great; moreover, having left the place for good, and somewhat dramatically, to become a bride, a return, even for so short a space, would have been a trifle humiliating.|$|R
6000|$|The {{decanter}} {{almost fell}} from the archdeacon's hand upon the table, and the start he made was so great as to make his wife jump up from her chair. Not accept the deanship! If it really ended in this, {{there would be no}} longer any doubt that his father-in-law <b>was</b> demented. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> whether a clergyman with low rank and preferment amounting to less than £200 a year should accept high rank, £1,200 a year, {{and one of the most}} desirable positions which his profession had to afford! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Clara; you {{certainly}} {{could not help}} what he might say to you. You could not refuse to listen to him. A lady in such a case, when she is on terms of intimacy with a gentleman, as you were with Mr. Fitzgerald, is bound to listen to him, and {{to give him an}} answer. You could not help what he might say, Clara. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> what answer did you give to what he said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You would perhaps flatter yourself," [...] he went on, [...] "that {{you were}} {{performing}} a heroic deed of deliverance; {{you might as}} well try to turn locks with fine words as apply such notions to the politics of Florence. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> not whether you can have any belief in me, but whether, now you have been warned, you will dare to rush, like a blind man with a torch in his hand, amongst intricate affairs of which you know nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{are going}} to get out of here," [...] said the ape-man, [...] "we can't lose any time. We are {{together}} at last and nothing can be gained by delay. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the safest way. The couple who escaped us evidently departed through the passageway to the roof and secured the trap against us so that we are cut off in that direction. What chance have we below? You came that way," [...] and he turned toward the girl.|$|E
60|$|It needed {{care and}} skill. We watched her for hours, and she {{showed no sign}} or gleam of recovery. Her sleep was deeper than either Sebastian's or Hilda's had been. She had taken a big dose, so as to secure immobility. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> would she recover at all from it? Hour after hour we waited and watched; and {{not a sign of}} movement! Only the same deep, slow, {{hampered}} breathing, the same feeble, jerky pulse, the same deathly pallor on the dark cheeks, the same corpse-like rigidity of limb and muscle.|$|R
60|$|He had {{forgotten}} Kenby in these aesthetic interests, but he remembered him {{again when he}} called a carriage, and ordered it driven to their hotel. It was the hour of the German mid-day table d'hote, {{and they would be}} sure to meet him there. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> how March should own his presence in time to prevent his wife from showing her ignorance of it to Kenby himself, and he was still turning <b>the</b> <b>question</b> hopelessly over in his mind when the sight of the hotel seemed to remind her of a fact which she announced.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> as {{to which}} of those two places we were looking down upon. Toby insisted {{that it was the}} abode of the Happars, and I that it was tenanted by their enemies, the ferocious Typees. To be sure I was not entirely {{convinced}} by my own arguments, but Toby’s proposition to descend at once into the valley, and partake of the hospitality of its inmates, {{seemed to me to be}} risking so much upon the strength of a mere supposition, that I resolved to oppose it until we had more evidence to proceed upon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I {{have done}} all that and am quite {{satisfied}} with the security --an advance of thirty thousand charged on all the Honham Castle estates at four per cent. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> if you are prepared to consent to the transfer. In that case all the old charges on the property will be paid off, and Mr. Quest, who will act {{for me in the}} matter, will prepare a single deed charging the estate for the round total." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, gentlemen,' said Redgauntlet, 'it {{is not for}} me {{to oppose}} the opinion of every one; and I must do you the justice to say, that the king has, in the present instance, {{neglected}} a condition of your agreement which was laid before him in very distinct terms. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> who is to acquaint him with the result of this conference; for I presume you would not wait on him in a body to make the proposal that he should dismiss a person from his family as the price of your allegiance.' ...|$|E
60|$|Heights; {{as far as}} Steindorfel and farther, {{a general}} {{continent}} of Austrians enclosing all the south and southwest; and, in fact, that here is now nothing to be done. That the question of his flank is settled; that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> of his front, which the appointed Austrian parties are now upon attacking. Question especially of the Heights of Drehsa, and of the Pass and Brook of Drehsa (rearward of his centre part), where his one retreat will lie, Steindorfel being now lost. Part first of the Affair is ended; Part second of it begins.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> {{whether this}} <b>is</b> {{the same thing}} asfor an {{arbitrary}} real number [...]|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> {{what should}} be done with this money. There are various modes which are adopted for {{investing}} such sums so as to get an annual income from them. The money may be lent to some person who will take it and pay interest for it. A house may be bought and let to some one who wishes to hire it; or shares in a rail-road, or a bank, or a bridge, may be taken. Such kinds of property as those are managed by directors, who take care of all the profits that are made, and twice a year divide the money among the persons that own the shares.|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{entering}} the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and {{framework of the}} hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot {{had been placed in}} coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I <b>was</b> clear. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> man and who was it brought him the coronet? ...|$|R
