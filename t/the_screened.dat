25|$|The {{simplest}} {{form of this}} approximation centers non-overlapping spheres (referred to as muffin tins) on {{the atomic}} positions. Within these regions, the potential experienced by an electron is approximated to be spherically symmetric about the given nucleus. In the remaining interstitial region, <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> potential is approximated as a constant. Continuity of the potential between the atom-centered spheres and interstitial region is enforced.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to selection is a screening system. Each variant gene is individually expressed and assayed to quantitatively measure the activity (most often by a colourgenic or fluorogenic product). The variants are then ranked and the experimenter decides which variants {{to use as}} templates for {{the next round of}} DE. Even the most high throughput assays usually have lower coverage than selection methods but give the advantage of producing detailed information on each one of <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> variants. This disaggregated data {{can also be used to}} characterise the distribution of activities in libraries which is not possible in simple selection systems. Screening systems, therefore, have advantages when it comes to experimentally characterising adaptive evolution and fitness landscapes.|$|E
25|$|Hackett {{lobbied for}} the {{creation}} of an African-American community hospital but was unsuccessful. In 1921, Hackett purchased the residence of former Territorial Governor Joseph Kibbey which was located next door to his house at 1342 E. Jefferson St.. In 1922, he established the Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital a private medical in that residence. The hospital didn't have many beds at first and each bed was situated in <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> porch of the house. Hackett purchased three adjoining lots and was, therefore, able to expand the hospital. He also had six cottages built for tuberculosis patients. He charged his patients $12.50 to $35.00 per week for a hospital stay. Hackett opened a pharmacy nearby and recruited Southern African-American nurses with college nursing degrees to join his staff. One of the benefits which the African-American doctors and nurses gained from joining him was the opportunity to gain valuable experience in their chosen field.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of influence {{of factors that}} depend on construction characteristics of the vibrosieves with circular vibrations on screening efficiency is presented in this paper. The dependence of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency on <b>the</b> aperture size, length and inclination of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> {{as well as on}} vibration amplitude, is considered. Based on obtained results, one can see that <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency increases with vibration amplitude and <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> length increase. Further, increases of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> inclination and aperture size are causing an initial increase of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency, which is later decreasing...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>screener</b> {{positions}} {{himself with}} his back to the basket on the same side of the court as the cutter. The cutter positions himself outside of and above <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> [...] "Outside" [...] implies that the cutter is closer to the sideline than <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> [...] "Above" [...] implies that the cutter is closer to the midcourt line than <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> Neither player has the ball. With <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> completely stationary, <b>the</b> cutter moves toward the basket and passes close enough to <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> that they almost touch shoulders. If the cut is properly made, the player defending the cutter will be disrupted by <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> (who has not moved while setting <b>the</b> <b>screen)</b> and <b>the</b> cutter will have an opportunity to receive a pass very near the basket.|$|R
2500|$|From 1967–69, renovations were undertaken: the {{original}} adobe brick chimney, which was crumbling, was removed; the front doorway was widened; and, in 1968, a dormer was added {{on the north}} side of the structure. Additional remodeling occurred from 1976–78 when additional bedrooms were created by enclosing <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> porch {{on the north side}} of the building, as well as remodeling of the existing bedrooms and bathroom. The rooms upstairs were also remodeled at this time, as well as the switching of the locations of the dining room and kitchen, which were also updated. A statue of St. Francis, was installed in a small alcove next to the front door in 1980, brought in from the church in Lukachukai. Also in 1980, a mudroom by the rear entrance was also added. [...] A ﬁreplace was added to the south wall of the Friary’s living room on December 1, 1981, with a triple walled chimney pipe.|$|E

60|$|Next day the Captain and I transacted our {{business}} in the Harbour Office. It was a lofty, big, cool, white room, where <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> light of day glowed serenely.

Enormous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught through that immaculate interior and upon our perspiring heads.|$|E

60|$|After {{a moment}} he {{followed}} the others in, blinking in <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt {{here and there in}} prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.|$|E
60|$|Morning came, {{and brought}} back the sense that his gentle little {{companion}} was gone from him; and Richard wept again, {{as if he could}} not be consoled, as he beheld <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> couch where the patient smile would never again greet him. He now knew that he had loved Carloman all the more for his weakness and helplessness; but his grief was not like Lothaire's, for with the Prince's was still joined a selfish fear: his cry was still, that he should die too, if not set free, and violent weeping really made him heavy and ill.|$|E
60|$|The next moment, with clenched jaw and hand, {{he passed}} Atufal, and stood unharmed in the light. As {{he saw his}} trim ship lying peacefully at anchor, and almost within {{ordinary}} call; as he saw his household boat, with familiar faces in it, patiently rising and falling, on the short waves by the San Dominick's side; and then, glancing about the decks where he stood, saw the oakum-pickers still gravely plying their fingers; and heard the low, buzzing whistle and industrious hum of the hatchet-polishers, still bestirring themselves over their endless occupation; and more than all, as he saw the benign aspect of nature, taking her innocent repose in the evening; <b>the</b> <b>screened</b> sun in the quiet camp of the west shining out like the mild light from Abraham's tent; as charmed eye and ear took in all these, with the chained figure of the black, clenched jaw and hand relaxed. Once again he smiled at the phantoms which had mocked him, and felt something like a tinge of remorse, that, by harboring them even for a moment, he should, by implication, have betrayed an atheist doubt of the ever-watchful Providence above.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has a}} {{downside}} of possible blockage to <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> due to <b>the</b> feed slurry containing small crystals besides large and normal solids crystals.
