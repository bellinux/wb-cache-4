5|$|At 5:31 pm Japan Standard Time (0831UTC) on October27, a Japan Airlines Boeing 767-300 {{heading to}} Narita International Airport, {{encountered}} severe <b>turbulence</b> from Faxai about 74km (46mi) southeast of Narita. The <b>turbulence</b> caused seven injuries on the flight, {{as well as}} some damage to the plane.|$|E

5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air <b>turbulence</b> (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air <b>turbulence</b> can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E

5|$|Four {{people were}} killed in the Philippines by Koni, and an {{additional}} person was injured. Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe <b>turbulence,</b> resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able to exit the area of <b>turbulence</b> and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E

25|$|Above 1750ft, the axes of the <b>turbulence</b> {{coincide}} with the wind frame axes. Below 1750ft, the vertical <b>turbulence</b> axis is aligned with the Earth frame z-axis, the longitudinal <b>turbulence</b> axis is aligned with the projection of the mean wind vector onto the Earth frame's horizontal plane, and the lateral <b>turbulence</b> axis {{is determined by the}} right hand rule.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} pressure of time, cost pressure {{and need for}} innovation forces companies with a multiple variant series production to reorganize their production systems in shorter cycle times. Reasons for this are externally and internally induced <b>turbulences.</b> The <b>turbulences</b> are for example changes of the market, i. e. the shift in the product mix of the fluctuating availability of resources. The anticipatory recognition of such <b>turbulences</b> and initiation of measures needs to be supported much stronger. Simulation offers here, apart from planning aspects, potential for the monitoring and control of production systems through the prompt recording, processing, optimization and documentation of real production (operating) data...|$|R

25|$|Both the Dryden and von Kármán {{models are}} {{parameterized}} by a length scale and <b>turbulence</b> intensity. The {{combination of these}} two parameters determine {{the shape of the}} power spectral densities and therefore the quality of the models' fit to spectra of observed <b>turbulence.</b> Many combinations of length scale and <b>turbulence</b> intensity give realistic power spectral densities in the desired frequency ranges. The Department of Defense specifications include choices for both parameters, including their dependence on altitude, which are summarized below.|$|E
25|$|The models {{also make}} {{assumptions}} about how continuous gusts vary with altitude. The Dryden and von Kármán models {{specified by the}} Department of Defense define three different altitude ranges: low, 10ft to 1000ft AGL; medium/high, 2000ft AGL and above; and in between. The <b>turbulence</b> intensities, <b>turbulence</b> scale lengths, and <b>turbulence</b> axes depend on the altitude. The Department of Defense also provides models for the gust angular velocity but gives criteria based on airplane stability derivatives for when they can be omitted.|$|E

25|$|Caterhams {{have very}} poor {{aerodynamics}} {{due to the}} blunt windscreen, open-wheel design, and open cockpit. At very high speeds, lift becomes a problem. To combat this, the CSR has several features that reduce lift by 50%. The front cycle wings are fitted closer to the tires to reduce <b>turbulence.</b> In addition, they have a small lip that angles air upward and creates {{a small amount of}} down force. Also, the new front suspension scheme reduces <b>turbulence</b> and drag formerly caused by the spring and damper units. The biggest enhancement is the vent added on top of the nose cone. On previous Caterhams, the air from the radiator caused <b>turbulence</b> by knocking against the engine and other parts on the underside. A plastic panel behind the radiator now directs air straight out through the vent, creating down force and reducing <b>turbulence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{were able}} to {{conclude}} that there was significant foul weather and severe <b>turbulence</b> in the area at the time Flight 923 was attempting to land at Annette Island. Furthermore, the incorrect weather report by the Pan Am meteorologist left the pilot unaware of the <b>turbulence</b> and high winds he would encounter on approach. The CAB postulated that severe <b>turbulence</b> or severe icing may have caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. However this could not be declared the definitive cause of the accident due to insufficient evidence.|$|E
