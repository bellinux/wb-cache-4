5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

It includes the base {{system and a}} complete set of manual pages, and may include source code and useful packages in future versions.

Daily snapshots are available from the master site for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> install the most recent versions of DragonFly without building from source.|$|E

50|$|The Professional Performing Arts School (PPAS) {{was created}} in 1990 {{to meet the needs}} of two groups of students: <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pursue {{professional}} work in the arts as they earned a junior/senior high school diploma and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> study the arts as an avocation.|$|R
50|$|After the election, the {{alliance}} was disbanded. The PPI suffered a split of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> join Berlusconi's centre-right (the United Christian Democrats of Rocco Buttiglione) and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> ally with the left-wing Democratic Party of the Left.

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> end suffering and rebirth.|$|E

50|$|Competition {{for the use}} of {{the river}} created the centuries-old {{conflict}} between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> dam the river to build millraces and fish traps and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> travel and carry goods on it. Economic prosperity and the foundation of wealthy monasteries by the Anglo-Saxons attracted unwelcome visitors and by around AD 870 the Vikings were sweeping up the Thames on the tide and creating havoc as in their destruction of Chertsey Abbey.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, the New Mexico State Department of Game and Fish {{decided to}} {{introduce}} gemsbok to the Tularosa Basin in the United States. The introduction was {{a compromise between}} <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> preserve nature and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> use it for profit and promotion. Ninety-three were released from 1969 to 1977, with the current population estimated to be around 3,000 specimens. They thrived because their natural predators, including the lion, are not present.|$|R

5000|$|When the Nez Perce {{started up}} Cow Creek, {{they were only}} 80 mi from Canada.

The Nez Perce believed the soldiers were now far behind them. They were unaware that General Miles was coming cross country from Ft. Keogh as fast as his troops could travel. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go slower won out. [...] Because the Nez Perce paused instead of pressing ahead, on September 30, General Miles' column caught up with the Nez Perce who were camped on Snake Creek east of the Bear Paw Mountains, just 40 mi from Canada. Miles immediately attacked. On October 5, 1877 after six days of fighting, and with Nez Perce men, women and children suffering and dying from wounds and exposure to freezing weather, Chief Joseph surrendered the Nez Perce to the U.S. Army commanders.|$|R

25|$|To {{further reduce}} the data rate without {{significantly}} reducing quality, {{the size of}} the GOP can be increased, a different MPEG-1 quantization matrix can be used, the maximum data rate can be exceeded, and the bit rate of the MP2 audio can be reduced (or even the use of MP3 audio instead of MP2 audio). These changes can be advantageous for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> either maximize video quality, or use fewer discs.|$|E
25|$|In Chinese, {{many more}} {{characters}} were simplified than in Japanese; some characters were simplified {{in only one}} language; other characters were simplified {{in the same way}} in both languages, and other characters were simplified in both languages but in different ways.

25|$|Foreign {{nationals}} can, in {{the framework}} of the Commercial Code and subject to the observance of the relevant procedures, form and register companies in Iran. Iran’s Commercial Code does not differentiate between Iranian and foreign stock holders of Iranian companies. In other words, there is no restriction regarding the nationality of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> establish companies in Iran. In this context, foreign exchange restrictions are equally applied to Iranian and foreign investors. Such companies, however, do not enjoy the privileges set out in FIPPA (see below).|$|E
50|$|The early {{pioneers of}} rock'n'roll (so-called urlatori) had some media {{coverage}} as novelties, but soon, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{pursue a career}} in music business had to switch toward the traditional mainstream.|$|R
