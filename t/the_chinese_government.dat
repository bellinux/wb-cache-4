5|$|Dhondup Wangchen (born 17 October 1974) is a Tibetan filmmaker {{imprisoned by}} <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>government</b> in 2008 on charges {{related to his}} {{documentary}} Leaving Fear Behind. Made with senior Tibetan monk Jigme Gyatso, the documentary consists of interviews with ordinary Tibetan people discussing the 14th Dalai Lama, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>government,</b> the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and Han Chinese migrants to the region.

5|$|Disney was keen {{to promote}} Mulan to the Chinese, hoping to {{replicate}} their {{success with the}} 1994 film The Lion King, {{which was one of}} the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>government</b> which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>government</b> considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepts ten Western films per year to be shown in their country, Mulans chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>government</b> did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after the Chinese New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.|$|E
