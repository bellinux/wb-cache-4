5|$|The {{trailing}} edge of <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short}} time even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E

5|$|Evan then {{receives}} an urgent visit from Jamarcus, who confesses {{that he is}} one of the aliens but has decided to side with humanity after experiencing human culture. He warns the group that the aliens are building a transmitter beneath the Costco store which will summon their armada to destroy the earth; he is expelled from the watch for his deception. Bob, Franklin, Evan, and Abby arm themselves and infiltrate the Costco to destroy <b>the</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Bob encounters Jason who reveals that he is also an alien, and they fight. Evan and Franklin attempt to disable <b>the</b> <b>transmitter,</b> but are surrounded by aliens. Jamarcus arrives and saves the pair, revealing that the aliens' brains are located in their crotch; Bob kills Jason by ripping off his penis. Evan discovers that <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> is powered by the metallic orb and removes it, disabling the machine. More aliens arrive, forcing the group to flee.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{discrete}} memoryless Multiple Access Channels (MACs) with two-sided feedback {{in the presence}} of two correlated channel states that are correlated in the sense of Slepian-Wolf (SW).

We also find the capacity region of discrete memoryless MAC with two-sided feedback and with SW-type correlated states available causally or strictly causally to <b>the</b> <b>transmitters.</b> We also study discrete memoryless MAC with partial feedback {{in the presence of}} two SW-type correlated channel states that are provided non-causally, causally, or strictly causally to <b>the</b> <b>transmitters.</b> An achievable rate region is found when channel states are non-causally provided to <b>the</b> <b>transmitters</b> whereas capacity regions are characterized when channel states are causally, or strictly causally available at <b>the</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> is turned on before it turns off so the {{receiver}} can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|By 1939, it {{was clear}} that war was looming, and the team began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E
5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide.

5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|VK3RTV is an {{experimental}} Amateur Television repeater located on Mt Dandenong {{to the east}} of Melbourne. In late September 2009 the former single analog channel was converted to a 2 channel digital system.

30|$|A general M-user fading MAC is {{considered}} in [5] where the receiver has perfect channel state knowledge and broadcasts channel state information {{of all the}} users to all <b>the</b> <b>transmitters.</b> <b>The</b> authors prove that the capacity region of a M-user MAC has a polymatroid structure, and they exploit this structural property to find the optimal power and rate control policy. Time-varying additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) MAC is studied in [6] where {{it is assumed that}} only the receiver can track the channel and not <b>the</b> <b>transmitters.</b> In that case, <b>the</b> <b>transmitters</b> allocate fixed powers (which satisfy the average power constraint) and transmit data over the channel.|$|R
25|$|Alcohol {{acts as a}} {{positive}} allosteric modulator and therefore amplifies <b>the</b> <b>transmitter’s</b> inhibitory effects.

5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles.

This led to an upgraded design with five times <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965.

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies.

The current induced alternates at the same frequency as <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E
5|$|In testing <b>the</b> <b>transmitter</b> proved only barely {{suitable}} in the air-to-air role, {{with short}} detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E
