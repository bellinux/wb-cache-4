40|$|Due {{to budget}} constraints, {{most of the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> in the US are retimed once every 2 - 5 years. Despite that, traffic delay {{increases}} 3 - 5 % per year with outdated timing plans.

In this project, we develop a performance visualization and fine-tuning tool for arterial <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>systems,</b> aimed at reducing the labor costs for signal retiming. Using high-resolution event-based data from the SMART-Signal system, a set of easy-to-use algorithms are developed to refine <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>systems.</b> Specifically, a framework is developed to diagnose operational problems regarding cycle lengths, green splits and offsets. Then, algorithms for offsets and green splits fine-tuning are proposed. To fine-tune offsets, a practical procedure to construct time space diagram (TS-Diagram) to visualize the progression quality on arterials is proposed and validated. For green splits, an adjusted measure of effectiveness (MOE), the utilized green time (UGT), is proposed for performance evaluation. Moreover, a practical procedure for time of day (TOD) transitions is also developed to generate optimal timing plan schedules. Field case studies and simulation experiments are carried out to illustrate and validate the proposed algorithms. The algorithms could be used during the retiming process to help agencies reduce labor costs, or to periodically refine <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>systems</b> for coordinated arterials.

40|$|In {{planning}} traffic-dependent {{controls for}} <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>systems</b> repetitive subproblems frequently occur. Solutions {{which are used}} {{again and again in}} the same or deviating form exist for such subproblems at many planning offices and producers of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>systems.</b> However as a rule these differ considerably in terms of their realization, application width and parameters. Present solutions for subproblems with <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>systems</b> are frequently not known generally, are documented in various forms and depth, are too specialized to one certain purpose or characterized highly by the style of the specific manufacturer, so that subsequent modifications by other processors may be difficult. The main objective of this research and development project was therefore to develop primary requirements for definition of the function and description of the treatment of universally applicable software modules for traffic-dependent <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controls, with the intention of creating a basis for solving traffic-related problems with virtual independence from the planner or manufacturer and ensure uniform treatment in the development of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> programs. This research and development project is therefore intended to create the basis for modularization and standardization in order to establish a 'library' with appropriate modules in the future. Analysis of the problems specified showed that a significant step toward a solution would be to differentiate between specification and realization of a module. In contrast to module realization, module specification allows formulation of the function with virtual independence from the planner/manufacturer, thereby allowing potential users a better decision in terms of selection, application or new development of a module.
