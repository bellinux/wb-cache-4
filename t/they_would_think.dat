500|$|The {{producers}} also {{intended to}} tease {{the audience that}} after the brutal killing of Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) from the previous episode, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that things could not get worse for the team, until the nuclear threat in the finale. The scene where the team breaks Connie out was intended to show the audience that the protagonists {{are willing to go}} to extreme measures to stop serious threats. Cross wanted to make it a very pure Spooks episode by setting up the entire plot in one scene, and then include a chase throughout London between FSB officers and the main characters. Cross enjoyed creating the FSB team featured in the episode, especially as he created them as a Russian version of the Spooks protagonists, but also make their base much more lit with windows. The bomb defusal scene was originally set at a graveyard, but the producers decided {{it would be best to}} set it underground. Though it took several rewrites, the script remained [...] "fundamentally the same" [...] throughout the writing process.|$|E
2500|$|These proponents also assumed, that uniform cost {{accounting}} would increase factory efficiency. The general idea for manufacturers was, that [...] "the more <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> systematically about 'planning, routing, and scheduling' conversion processes within the firm... {{the more they}} [...] understood {{about the cost of}} the many products they made, the more they could distinguish the profitable from the unprofitable." [...] In this context Nicholson had argued: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joshua and Caleb exhorted the Israelites not to fear {{and not to}} rebel against God. Just as the {{community}} threatened to pelt them with stones, God's Presence appeared in the Tabernacle. God complained to Moses: [...] "How long will this people spurn Me," [...] and threatened to strike them with pestilence and make of Moses a nation more numerous than they. But Moses told God {{to think of what}} the Egyptians would think when they heard the news, and how <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> God powerless to bring the Israelites to the Promised Land. Moses asked God to forbear, quoting God's self-description as [...] "slow to anger and abounding in kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression." [...] In response, God pardoned, but also swore that none of the men who had seen God's signs would see the Promised Land, except Caleb and Joshua.|$|E

6000|$|Miss Annie {{assured her}} {{that she and her}} {{companion}} would be certain to [...] "sit solemn," [...] and that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> of such a thing as going to church and behaving indecorously.|$|R
2500|$|John Younger {{was almost}} arrested in Dallas County, Texas in January 1871. He killed two lawmen during the attempt and escaped. On June 3, 1871, the gang robbed {{a bank in}} Corydon, Iowa; the James and Younger {{brothers}} were suspects. The bank contacted the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in Chicago, the first involvement of the famous agency {{in the pursuit of}} the Jamesâ€“Younger Gang. Agency founder Allan Pinkerton dispatched his son, Robert Pinkerton, who joined a county sheriff in tracking the gang to a farm in Civil Bend, Missouri. A short gunfight ended indecisively as the gang escaped. On June 24, Jesse James {{wrote a letter to the}} Kansas City Times, claiming Republicans were persecuting him for his Confederate loyalties by accusing him and Frank of carrying out the robberies. [...] "But I don't care what the degraded Radical party thinks about me," [...] he wrote, [...] "I would just as soon <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> I was a robber as not." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A good smart blowin' up {{with the}} belluses would make the green stick burn most {{as well as the}} dry one after a spell. I guess contentedness is the best bellus for young folks, ef <b>they</b> <b>would</b> only <b>think</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is not so}} {{much for}} myself I care; but what would happen to my children? My father is safe--he is so old and {{helpless}} that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never <b>think</b> of touching him--but my boys? Caterina would throw them into prison without a scruple.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{as to the}} express, father, I don't {{expect them}} to come by that, as poor Harry Somerville has been so ill that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never <b>think</b> of venturing to subject him to all the discomforts, {{not to mention the}} dangers, of a canoe voyage." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl kept {{slipping}} {{toward the}} door. [...] "I shouldn't {{know what to}} tell them, when I got home. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> I must be--out of my senses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare say, now, that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of asking, for a {{place like}} this, {{as much money as}} would buy a good {{wholesome}} ship--a regular A. No. 1." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} they would go in there, because, as the {{hurricane}} season had begun when they got here, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it better to run into the port." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should go}} {{and let him}} do his worst," [...] said Fisher, who was another clerk. [...] "It wouldn't be more than putting you down a place or two. As to losing your present berth you don't mind that, and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never <b>think</b> of dismissing you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That doesn't {{matter with}} me, of course, but suppose it {{happened}} with somebody else? What <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>think?</b> <b>They</b> <b>would</b> suspect something merely from her expression. She looked--she looked"--he hesitated--"like some one walking in her sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{a doctor}} come?" [...] asked Ross, huskily, moved by Wetherford's words. [...] "It's a hard climb. <b>Would</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> the dago worth it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not here, my boy, or <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> a {{conspiracy}} was breaking out. Ha!" [...] as a sudden blare of trumpets broke {{out as they}} reached the station gate.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> {{that perhaps}} the Spirit meant the fifth street the other way, or the third house from the {{opposite}} corner, and would try again, with still more unpleasant results.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fie,' said she; 'what {{a ridiculous}} thing to ask anyone to do; just {{think what the}} {{neighbours}} would say if they saw me. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> I had taken leave of my senses.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not because}} they {{consider}} us their equals that {{they are supposed to}} look with abhorrence upon those who eat our flesh," [...] replied Ja; [...] "it is merely that we are warm-blooded animals. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> of eating the meat of a thag, which we consider such a delicacy, any more than I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of eating a snake. As a matter of fact it is difficult to explain just why this sentiment should exist among them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Feed them well,--treat them well--and {{make them}} work. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> never <b>think</b> of troubling us; nor do I suppose they know {{anything}} of navigation.

6000|$|... 'Good old ladies, {{they have}} always been very kind to me, and petted me {{exceedingly}} when I was a little child, but for the rest--' still seeing Albinia's anxious look--'Oh! <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> of it; I don't believe they could argue; they are not like the new-fashioned Roman Catholics of whom you are thinking, madame.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{naturally}} {{know what}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of any proposition {{like the one}} you made me. Anyway, as I suggested, {{all you have to}} do is to try them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do wish it," [...] she said, [...] "and {{everyone}} will be {{so happy to see}} you. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it strange if you did not come, for {{everyone will}} know by then that you have returned." ...|$|E

6000|$|Whether many hundred {{thousand}} Scotch Presbyterians, are not full as virulent against the Episcopal Church, {{as they are}} against the Papists; or, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have us <b>think,</b> the Papists are against them? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Offering them a path is {{just what}} makes them impudent," [...] said Lady Brandon to her husband. [...] "Why did you promise them anything? <b>They</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> it a {{hardship}} to walk {{a mile and a}} half, or twenty miles, to a public-house, but when they go to their work they think it dreadful to have to walk a yard. Perhaps <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like us to lend them the wagonette to drive in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{the natives}} {{the custom of}} walking through fire?" [...] said my friend the Beach-comber, in answer to a {{question}} of mine. [...] "Not that I know of. In fact the soles of their feet are so thick-skinned that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> nothing of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] moaned Phil. [...] "Oh, {{why must}} a minister's wife be {{supposed}} to utter only prunes and prisms? I shan't. Everybody on Patterson Street uses slang--that is to say, metaphorical language--and if I didn't <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> me insufferably proud and stuck up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> the truth," [...] said he. [...] "Perhaps {{they would}} imagine that I called you so because I liked you. But perhaps they might think also that you let me do so because you liked me. People do make such mistakes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can {{you even}} hint {{at such a}} thing, father?" [...] cried Laura indignantly. [...] "They have been as true as steel. What <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> if they heard you." ...|$|R

50|$|His {{personal}} physician, Lord Moran, {{recalled that}} Churchill already advocated a nuclear blow against the Soviets during {{a conversation in}} 1946:America knows that fifty-two percent of Russia's motor industry is in Moscow and could be wiped out by a single bomb. It might mean wiping out three million people, but <b>they</b> Soviets <b>would</b> <b>think</b> nothing of that. They think more of erasing an historical building like the Kremlin.|$|R
