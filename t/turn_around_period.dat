40|$|Application Service Maintenance Projects {{normally}} {{deals with}} Incidents as First Level support function. Incidents in majority directly link with Production Environment, so <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents {{is a significant}} factor. Many Companies are having Service Level Agreements with Customer for <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents. There {{is a need to}} focus on Estimating and Predicting <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for Incidents. Improvement in <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time helps in improving the Service Level Agreements earlier agreed with the Customer. Saved time can be diverted to other Project Activities like Enhancements or for new requests. This will also helps as one of the paths for Companies to get new business with the Customer. We have used Capability Maturity Model Integration(CMMI) V 1. 2 Quantitative Project Management(QPM) methodology for Application Service Maintenance(ASM) Projects for estimating and predicting <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> time for incidents. By implementing this best practice in SEI CMMI Level 5 Company we have achieved a significant improvement of approximately 50 percent reduction in Average <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> Time for incidents. </p...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{leaving the}} station, trains make a slight left hand turn, {{followed}} by a straight segment of track. This leads into another left hand turn and trains then climb the 100 ft lift hill. At the top, the track drops at a 53-degree angle. The maximum speed may vary between 50 and 55 miles per hour (80 and 88km/h) depending on the weather conditions, time of day and the load. Next the train rises into a right hand <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> This <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> leads to a sharp second drop, before rising over another hill, and passing through a left hand second <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> The second <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> has a double down element as riders descend another drop into the wooden structure. The ride makes another out and back run, and after the final <b>turn</b> <b>around,</b> hits the brake run, ending the ride.|$|R

40|$|Visual stimuli and {{socialization}} influence exploratory behaviour in crayfish. The predominant components of spontaneous exploratory behaviour {{were determined by}} observing the activity of solitary adult crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in a glass aquarium containing fresh water and no objects. Five distinct behaviours were observed: rearing up (climbing on the wall), <b>turning</b> <b>around,</b> cornering (facing the comer), backward walking, and crossing (crossing the midline of the aquarium). The frequency of rearing up, cornering and <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> decreased when reflection from the glass wall was blocked with black cardboard, black paint or non-reflective transparent plastic. In a tank containing mirrors {{on one side and}} non-reflective plastic on the other, crayfish cornered, reared up, and <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> more in front of the mirrors. Socialization was necessary for crayfish to respond to the reflection. Crayfish that were housed in pairs for two weeks exhibited more rearing up, <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> and cornering in front of the mirrors than in the non-reflective side. Crayfish isolated for two weeks did not show these differences. Socialized crayfish also exhibited more rearing up, <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> and cornering than did isolated crayfish. Thus, crayfish respond to visual stimuli provided by a glass tank, but the responds depends on socialization...|$|R
