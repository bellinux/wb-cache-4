Further investigations by John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.|$|E
5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is likely {{to be used as a}} precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs {{in people with}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|Given that Ganymede is {{completely}} differentiated {{and has a}} metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated {{in a similar fashion}} to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior. The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.|$|E

5|$|Like many low-mass stars, Gliese 876 is a {{variable}} star. Its variable star designation is IL Aquarii {{and it is}} classified as a BY Draconis variable. Its brightness fluctuates by around 0.04 magnitudes. This type of variability is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by large starspots {{moving in and out}} of view as the star rotates. Gliese 876 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals {{having the same}} ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific gene has been named.|$|E

Harrison tried to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule also made rest time scarce.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit body}} remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; {{dehiscence}} (fruit body opening) {{is caused by}} the pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the fruit body and the outside environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E

One person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> due to improperly ventilated generators {{in an area}} affected by the power outages. Moderate winds left about 1.4million customers without power across {{the state as a}} result of trees falling into power lines, with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees.|$|E

5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891.

The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months.
