500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson-Williams said that Hood attracted {{him to the}} project, adding: [...] "I happened {{to meet him at}} the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago. <b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> were both nominees, but both losers. He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy...and into music. So I was really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was created}} by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't [...] "Jnay" [...] Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte {{grew up in the}} same {{building}} where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived—560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song. The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick. Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, [...] "We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for anything right now.' Before we left the hotel <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> knew we would write a song about our city." [...] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z would like it and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded. However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon [...] "Big Jon" [...] Platt heard the track at a barbecue {{and fell in love with}} it, believing that [...] "it would be perfect for Jay-Z".|$|E
2500|$|Five {{months after}} the fire, Great White started a benefit tour, saying a prayer at the {{beginning}} of each concert for the friends and families affected by the incident and giving a portion of the proceeds to the Station Family Fund. In 2003, and again in 2005, the band stated they had not performed the song [...] "Desert Moon" [...] since the tragedy. [...] "I don't think I could ever sing that song again," [...] said lead vocalist and founder Jack Russell, while guitarist Mark Kendall stated [...] "We haven't played that song. Things that bring back memories of <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> try to stay away from. And that song reminds us of <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> haven't played it since then and probably never will." [...] By 2009, the band had resumed performing the song.|$|E
60|$|It was {{excessively}} dark <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when <b>we</b> {{set forth}} on our expedition.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> before <b>we</b> parted we {{had gone}} rather deeply into the plan of action for the {{immediate}} future.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{have not}} gone gentle into <b>that</b> good <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> do not roll over…. Our {{commitment}} will overwhelm indifference and inertia.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> heard Felicity {{talking to}} Cecily in their room.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> {{took the}} Narrow Gauge train, bound for Marshall Pass and the splendors of the Continental Divide.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> placed again {{two of my}} sovereigns on the table, and {{arranged}} the furniture with the same scrupulous care as before.|$|E
60|$|He smiled, {{and said}} no more, but <b>that</b> <b>night</b> as <b>we</b> were making camp I saw him {{unfasten}} Dejah Thoris' fetters himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{glass of}} my watch was smashed on <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when <b>we</b> were so treacherously assailed by the savages on the sandbank," [...] grumbled Mr. Travers.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the memoir}} {{of a fellow}} {{pioneering}} kibbutznik, [...] "It wasn't until late <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> found him, lying with a stick {{and a pair of}} shoes on his head: this was a sign of vengeance, it meant that in the fighting he had killed or wounded someone." ...|$|R
60|$|The missionary had {{at least}} seven happy {{listeners}} <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> were all glad that Sara did not have measles, and the Story Girl was radiant.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{told me he}} {{had been}} in the seventh heaven of devotion, {{especially}} <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> went to the foyer of the Français," [...] Mrs. Rooth insisted.|$|E
60|$|All <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> {{travelled}} and {{all next}} day until Tours was reached towards evening. There we halted for a sorely needed rest and for fresh horses.|$|E
60|$|But <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> as <b>we</b> sat {{before the}} fading red of the backlog, {{the old man}} dozing in his chair, Polly Ann {{put her hand on}} mine.|$|R
60|$|I {{slept at}} Baker Street <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> and <b>we</b> were engaged upon our toast and {{coffee in the}} morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no more}} {{sleep for}} us <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> so <b>we</b> both sat close together, and talked of what had struck us, and what damage it had done to the raft.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> scoured all the prairies of reading; dived {{into the}} bosoms of authors, and tore out their hearts; {{and that night}} White-Jacket learned more than he has ever done in any single night since.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> {{examined}} and repaired our arms ere we lay down to rest, although we were much fatigued, {{in order that}} we might be in readiness to set out on our expedition at daylight on the following morning.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> {{heard the}} story of how he had {{performed}} the feat of riding all the way from Rome in four-and-twenty hours, fleeing for his life from the peril of assassination, of which Madonna Lucrezia had warned him.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] he said suddenly, <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> as <b>we</b> sat in our chairs by the fire, talking {{over the}} events of the holidays, [...] "you have never congratulated me yet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I know!" [...] Margaret exclaimed. [...] "Look at the squire's height. Surely, Jane, {{these are}} the two {{soldiers}} who allowed us to pass them, <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when <b>we</b> fled from Sycharth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doctor," [...] said Oliver {{to me in}} a {{voice of}} studied nonchalance <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> as <b>we</b> were {{preparing}} to turn in, [...] "did you notice anything in the Vault of Kings this afternoon?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> {{went to bed}} early, for we were tired, {{and slept}} a heavy sleep, till at length, about one in the morning, we were awakened by the shoutings of the {{messengers}} who came bearing the terrible news.|$|E
60|$|We {{took him}} home <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> {{got him to}} go by telling him {{that his father had}} bought a silver-mounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him, {{and we were going to}} hunt bears the next day.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> abode in {{the house}} of Rartoo, a hospitable old chief. It was right on the shore of the lake; and at supper we looked out through a {{rustling}} screen of foliage upon the surface of the starlit water.|$|E
6000|$|... “You might {{remove the}} handcuffs,” he said <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> as <b>we</b> stood in {{consultation}} over him. “It’s dead safe. I’m a paralytic now. The next {{thing to watch}} out for is bed sores.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "People {{have really}} grown {{worse in the}} last several years, I think," [...] said Bess to me in a tired sort of voice <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> as <b>we</b> sat in the library after dinner.|$|R
60|$|We camped {{outside the}} {{fortified}} town <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Next morning <b>we</b> essayed {{to make our}} entry.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> {{turned in}} without {{standing}} watch, and next morning came a light, drizzling rain which {{forced us to}} keep under cover unless we were willing to toddle around on the wet decks, which was not particularly cheerful amusement.|$|E
60|$|The lachrymose Sara {{presently}} {{joined us}} and we discovered the cause of her tears to be the doleful fact {{that her mother had}} forbidden her to go to the magic lantern show <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> all showed the sympathy we felt.|$|E
60|$|About {{a quarter}} to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us {{that we should be}} late as supper was early <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> had rather a {{scramble}} to get ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the door.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>night</b> as <b>we</b> {{were going}} to bed I looked {{out of the window}} at the barn which {{contained}} the cow, and was astonished to see that there was a light inside of the building.|$|R
60|$|Maude and I {{were alone}} <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> As <b>we</b> {{sat in the}} library after our {{somewhat}} formal, perfunctory dinner, I ventured to ask her why she had gone away when I had offered to read.|$|R
60|$|Geoffrey, too, was up. How he {{had passed}} the {{remainder}} of <b>that</b> tragic <b>night</b> <b>we</b> need not inquire--not too happily we may be sure. He heard the front door close behind Beatrice, and followed out into the rain.|$|R
