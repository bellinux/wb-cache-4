25|$|One toponym {{with a good}} {{claim to}} {{derivation}} from the saint's name is Chadkirk Chapel in Romiley, Greater Manchester, which {{dates back to the}} 14th century– although the site is much older, possibly dating back to the 7th century when it is believed St Chad visited to bless the well there. Cameron points out that -kirk toponyms more frequently incorporate the name of the dedicatee, rather than the patron, so <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that Chadkirk really was dedicated to St Chad in the Middle Ages. It is not so certain that Chadsmoor in Staffordshire, Chadwich in Worcestershire, or Chadwick in Warwickshire, were named after the saint.|$|E
25|$|August Weismann was {{responsible}} for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre {{to make room for}} the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution. This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a teleological or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a purpose for ageing has been identified, but not a mechanism by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> think that the opposite is true: ageing decreases individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} Iron Age, Orkney {{was part of}} the Pictish kingdom, and {{although}} the archaeological remains from this period are less impressive <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose the fertile soils and rich seas of Orkney provided the Picts with a comfortable living. The Dalriadic Gaels began to influence the islands towards the close of the Pictish era, perhaps principally through the role of Celtic missionaries, as evidenced by several islands bearing the epithet [...] "Papa" [...] in commemoration of these preachers. However, before the Gaelic presence could establish itself the Picts were gradually dispossessed by the Norsemen from the late 8th century onwards. The nature of this transition is controversial, and theories range from peaceful integration to enslavement and genocide.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Jackson was {{contacted}} by Ric Birch of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) to mix sound for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney. Jackson felt that his skills {{would be put}} to best use as organiser and audio director rather than as one man behind a mixing console. He put together a team of audio professionals {{as well as an}} equipment design composed of digital nodes linked with optic fibre to transport digital audio around the largest venues without attenuation or ground hum. To wire the spectacle which played to 110,000 people in attendance and some 3billion distant viewers around the world, redundant systems were connected throughout so that a single failure point could not halt the show. To complete the assignment, Jackson said one of the main factors was working within budget, which was not unlimited as it had been with Streisand. He served as audio director for the opening ceremony on 15 September and the closing ceremony on 1 October. Before the event, he told a reporter, [...] "I have a well rehearsed crew in place and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> expect it to go well." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gigantic}} {{proportions of}} A. fragillimus have been debated by paleontologists. Carpenter {{has argued that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> take Cope at his word, noting that the paleontologist's reputation was at stake. The discovery {{took place during the}} Bone Wars, and Cope's rival Marsh, who was [...] "ever ready to humiliate" [...] Cope, never called the claims into question. Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope's discoveries, and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the Amphicoelias fragillimus bones. Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921, as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998, also accepted Cope's data without question in published reviews. Other paleontologists have been more critical. In an analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of A. fragillimus, Woodruff and Foster (2015) concluded that its size has been over-estimated and that modern palaeontologists were accepting Cope's interpretation without due scepticism. They note that no comparably gigantic sauropod fossils have been discovered in the Morrison Formation or elsewhere, that 19th century palaeontologists - including Cope himself - paid no attention to the size of A. fragillimus (even when it may have substantiated Cope's Rule of size increase in animal lineages over time), and that typographical errors in his measurements - such as reporting vertebral measurements in meters rather than millimeters - undermine their reliability. They concluded that the super-gigantic A. fragillimus is a 'highly unlikely' creature based on unquestioning interpretation of Cope's report.|$|E

That this was no mere rhetorical flourish on his part, designed for public consumption, is apparent from his constant allusions to Providence in his personal letters. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe, from a careful analysis of religious references in his private correspondence, that Washington's reliance upon a Grand Designer along Deist lines was as deep-seated and meaningful for his life as, say, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s serene confidence in a Universal Spirit permeating the ever shifting appearances of the everyday world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} is often asked, how {{the cab and}} omnibus proprietors take to these innovations. Of course not very kindly, but experience shows that these individuals are more frightened than hurt. At first {{there is a little}} loss of revenue to the cabmen, but in the end the result is no worse, as people get educated to riding everywhere, and cabs get a fair share. The railways were said to have struck a death-blow at the ordinary vehicle traffic, but such did not prove to be true, and, wherever tramways have opened there has been no decrease in the numbers of cabs - Leicester for instance. Since the company have been running per timetable, the bus proprietors {{have done the same thing}} along St. Ann's Well-road, and with good result. For the comfort of the shareholders of the company, it may be stated that the directors will no doubt pay in July (with the interim dividend paid in February), a dividend at the rate of six per cent per annum. When this is taken into full consideration - that is to say, when all the difficulties are duly allowed for, and it is remembered that only a portion of the line is as yet opened - the result is most satisfactory. Indeed all the shares are now quoted at two per cent premium with few vendors. As to the character of the company, I think it is not undue flattery to say that it is efficiently and economically managed as the staff is limited to the mere necessary officials, and the directorate is small. Considering the rail employed is one that is sure to result in great saving to the shareholders, seeing that there will be little or no cost of repairs, and taking into consideration also the fact that the tramway route is populous, and the working expenses small, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> prophecy success to the company [...] [...] [...] As far as we can make out the estimated weekly receipts of the Tramway Company amount to about £350, and in Whit week we believe as much as £430 was taken, for which upwards of 50,000 people were carried. Taking £350 as the average weekly receipts gives a total of over £17,000 in a year, which is a very large sum indeed for the present branch of tramway service in a town of such proportions as Nottingham [...] [...] [...] There are 212 cabs in the town, so that estimating the earnings at but £2 per week there is a total of £424 weekly, or £20,000 a year. Taking the above as a very moderate estimate, and making a little allowance for omnibuses, 'carriers' carts, , it is fair to suppose that at least £40,000 a year is spent in Nottingham for passenger traffic.|$|E
