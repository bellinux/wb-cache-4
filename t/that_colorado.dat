25|$|When the United States Supreme Court {{dismissed}} {{requests to}} hear an appeal of the Kitchen case on October 6, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers asked the Tenth Circuit to lift the stay in this case as it related to Colorado, which would allow the district court's order <b>that</b> <b>Colorado</b> recognize same-sex marriages to take effect. On October 7, the Colorado Supreme Court removed the legal obstacles preventing Colorado's county clerks from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, legalising same-sex marriage in the state.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} {{was the most}} recent in which Georgia and Montana voted for the Democratic candidate, {{the last time the}} state of Florida backed the losing candidate, and the last time <b>that</b> <b>Colorado</b> voted Democratic until 2008. This was also the first time since Texas' admission to the Union in 1845 that a Democrat won the White House without winning the state, and the second time a Democrat won the White House without North Carolina (the first was 1844), and the second time since Florida's admission (also in 1845) that a Democrat won without winning the state (John F. Kennedy in 1960 was the first).|$|E
25|$|By this time, referee J. C. Louderback and his officiating {{crew had}} {{realized}} their mistake, and conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, {{radio and television}} announcers also noticed <b>that</b> <b>Colorado</b> had scored {{with the help of}} an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: the touchdown counted, giving Colorado a 33-31 lead. They also decided that the Buffs would have to attempt the extra point. The rules do not require the extra point try if time has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game. However, since Colorado only led by two, Missouri could have potentially blocked the try and returned it for two points to tie the game, the try was required. Not wanting to take this chance, Johnson took the snap and went to a knee, allowing the Buffaloes to go home with a controversial win.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} argued on October 10, 1995. On May 20, 1996, {{the court ruled}} 6–3 <b>that</b> <b>Colorado's</b> Amendment 2 was unconstitutional, though on {{different}} reasoning from the Colorado courts. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, and was joined by John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. The Court majority held <b>that</b> the <b>Colorado</b> constitutional amendment targeting homosexuals based upon animosity lacked a rational relation to any legitimate governmental purpose.|$|R

2500|$|Stevens {{explained}} {{his decision to}} use the U.S. {{rather than in the}} Middle East or Europe in 1962. [...] "I wanted to get an effect of grandeur as a background to Christ, and none of the Holy Land areas shape up with the excitement of the American southwest," [...] he said.

2500|$|Open {{source in}} {{education}} — Colleges and organizations use software predominantly online {{to educate their}} students. Open source technology is being adopted by many institutions because it can save these institutions from paying companies {{to provide them with}} these administrative software systems. One of the first major colleges to adopt an open source system was Colorado State University in 2009 with many others following after <b>that.</b> <b>Colorado</b> State Universities system was produced by the Kuali Foundation who has become a major player in open source administrative systems. The Kuali Foundation defines itself as a group of organizations that aims to [...] "build and sustain open source software for higher education, by higher education."

Gloria Allred, who represents most of the nearly 60 alleged victims, spoke to the gathering via Skype: [...] "I have been to New Jersey, and I'm not aware of any down side since they eliminated the statute (of limitations) for rape and sex assault." [...] Brauchler said he does not want any victim denied a fair hearing because of Colorado's statute, but [...] "I don't have a magic number". Any change would have to be done carefully, he said, because the more time that passes between an alleged sex assault and prosecution, the harder it is for the accused to defend themselves. Fields noted <b>that</b> <b>Colorado</b> has no statutory limit on murder. [...] "Why have an arbitrary cap for sex assault?" ...|$|E
