5|$|The {{introduction}} of British Rail Class 201 diesel-electric multiple units to the Hastings route after 1957 and {{the completion of}} the electrification of the South Eastern Main Line in 1961 deprived the class of much of their work. Withdrawals began in January 1961 and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> had disappeared from service by December 1962.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> was banned from operating under them {{with effect from}} 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E
5|$|In class, Veronica and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> {{are asked}} to {{participate}} in Woody Goodman's (Steve Guttenberg) essay contest. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) invites Veronica to visit Hearst College. Logan abruptly breaks up with Hannah without giving an explanation, leaving her heartbroken. A student named Dean (Michael Cera) conducts Veronica and Wallace's tour of Hearst, and the pair suddenly run into Troy. Veronica mocks Troy to his face, but he insists that he has changed his ways. At a party, {{one of the students}} hits on Veronica. The student gets more aggressive with Veronica, and when Troy begins to defend her, the student punches him. Later that night, Veronica sees Troy making out with Stacy (Alia Shawkat). When Veronica is sleeping, Troy calls her unexpectedly, pleading for help, and Veronica visits him at the police station, where he has been charged in the date-rape of Stacy. Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) comes to the aid of Cliff (Daran Norris), from whom a briefcase of legal documents was stolen.|$|E

In this paper we prove constructibility of {{vanishing}} cycles sheaves for arbitrary formal schemes locally finitely presented over k◦ {{as well as}} special formal schemes over k ◦ (for discretely valued k). This allows us to extend continuity results, established earlier for locally algebraic formal schemes, to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>classes</b> of formal schemes...|$|R

5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E
25|$|Where {{more than}} one order number had been used for a given class, the first order number {{allocated}} was {{used to refer to}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class.</b> Where locomotives were purchased from outside manufacturers, they were referred to by the lowest number applied to a class member.|$|E
25|$|The Westinghouse bogie cars, nos. 68 to 77, {{were good}} riders but {{extremely}} slow, so in January number 77 was sent away and retrucked with Brill 27G trucks, receiving 4x30 h.p. Westinghouse motors {{at the same}} time, thus doubling its motive power. As {{a result of the}} improvement created, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> was treated similarly during the next two months.|$|E

25|$|The OLPC XO-1 {{hardware}} lacks connectivity {{to external}} monitors or projectors, {{and teachers are}} not provided with software for remote assessment. As a result, students are unable to present their work to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class,</b> and teachers must also assess students' work from the individual laptops. Teachers often {{find it difficult to}} use the keyboard and screen, which were designed with student use in mind.|$|E
25|$|The entire U1 {{class had}} smokebox {{snifting}} valves, a feature previously {{used on the}} other Maunsell moguls. The main batch saw the front steps relocated ahead of the cylinders, as opposed to behind on the A890 rebuild, which was another relic of its previous guise as a 2-6-4 tank locomotive. Smoke deflectors were fitted to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> from 1933, as {{with most of the}} locomotives designed by Maunsell. The smokebox snifting valves were removed by Oliver Bulleid {{by the end of the}} Second World War, although the U1 class chimney was used to improve draughting on the other Maunsell moguls.|$|E
25|$|All the IITs {{follow the}} credits system of {{performance}} evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses {{based on their}} importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) {{form the basis of}} grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. Sometimes, relative grading is done considering the overall performance of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class.</b> For each semester, the students are graded on a scale of 0 to 10 based on their performance, by taking a weighted average of the grade points from all the courses, with their respective credit points. Each semester evaluation is done independently and then the weighted average over all semesters is used to calculate the cumulative grade point average (known as CGPA or CPI—Cumulative Performance Index).|$|E

25|$|Many {{mathematical}} objects, such as sets {{of numbers}} and functions, exhibit internal structure {{as a consequence of}} operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of the new locomotives was mixed, depending upon {{the experience of the}} crew and the circumstances under which they were operating. At times it was no better than their smaller predecessors. Maunsell therefore undertook a number of experiments to try to improve the {{performance of}} the new locomotives. No. E859 was fitted with smaller [...] driving wheels to see if this would improve performance over the heavily graded London-Dover line, but the difference was marginal. No. E860 was fitted with a longer, heavier boiler but once again with little improvement. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> however benefitted from the fitting of smoke deflectors during the late 1920s.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{contribution}} is to determine physical and geometrical characterizations of <b>whole</b> <b>classes</b> of stationary cyclic symmetric gravitational fields coupled to Maxwell electromagnetic fields within the $(2 + 1) $-dimensional gravity. The physical characterization {{is based on the}} determination of the local and global energy-momentum-mass quantities using the Brown-York approach. As far as to the algebraic-geometrical characterization is concerned, the eigenvalue problem for the electromagnetic field, energy-momentum and Cotton tensors is solved and their types are established. The families of Einstein-Maxwell solutions to be considered are: all uniform electromagnetic solutions possessing electromagnetic fields with vanishing covariant derivatives (stationary uniform and spinning Clement classes), all fields having constant electromagnetic field and energy-momentum tensors' invariants (Kamata-Koikawa solutions), <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>classes</b> of hybrid electromagnetic Ayon-Cataldo-Garcia solutions, a new family of stationary electromagnetic solutions, the electrostatic and magnetostatic solutions with Peldan limit, the Clement spinning charged metric, the Martinez-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole solution, and Dias-Lemos electromagnetic solution...|$|R

500|$|The first skeleton, {{known as}} the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was {{unearthed}} in 1861 near Langenaltheim, Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the Natural History Museum in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by Richard Owen as Archaeopteryx macrura, allowing for the possibility it {{did not belong to}} the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin described how some authors had maintained [...] "that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archaeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world." ...|$|E

Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's permanent file and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who might have known her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was [...] "vicious". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction is rife with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud in front of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>class</b> which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
