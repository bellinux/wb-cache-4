40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} examined <b>transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> {{of action}} potentials between 2 and 3 parallel chain of cardiac muscle cells (CMC) simulated using the PSpice program. The {{present study was}} done to examine <b>transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> between 5 parallel chains in an expanded model of CMC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). Methods Excitation was transmitted from cell to cell along a strand of 5 cells not connected by low-resistance tunnels (gap-junction connexons). The entire surface membrane of each cell fired nearly simultaneously, and nearly all the propagation time was spent at the cell junctions, the junctional delay time being about 0. 3 – 0. 5 ms (CMC) or 0. 8 – 1. 6 ms (SMC). A negative cleft potential (V jc) develops in the narrow junctional clefts, whose magnitude depends on the radial cleft resistance (R jc), which depolarizes the postjunctional membrane (post-JM) to threshold. Propagation velocity (θ) increased with amplitude of V jc. Therefore, one mechanism for the transfer of excitation from one cell to the next is by the electric field (EF) that is generated in the junctional cleft when the pre-JM fires. In the present study, 5 parallel stands of 5 cells each (5 × 5 model) were used. Results With electrical stimulation of the first cell of the first strand (cell A 1), propagation rapidly spread down that chain and then jumped to the second strand (B chain), followed by jumping to the third, fourth, and fifth strands (C, D, E chains). The rapidity by which the parallel chains became activated depended on the longitudinal resistance of the narrow extracellular cleft between the parallel strands (R ol 2); the higher the R ol 2 resistance, the faster the θ. The transverse resistance of the cleft (R or 2) had almost no effect. Increasing R jc decreases the total propagation time (TPT) over the 25 -cell network. When the first cell of the third strand (cell C 1) was stimulated, propagation spread down the C chain and jumped {{to the other two}} strands (B and D) nearly simultaneously. Conclusions <b>Transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> of excitation occurred at multiple points along the chain as longitudinal propagation was occurring, causing the APs in the contiguous chains to become bunched up. <b>Transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> was more erratic and labile in SMC compared to CMC. Transverse transmission of excitation did not require low-resistance connections between the chains, but instead depended on the value of R ol 2. The tighter the packing of the chains facilitated <b>transverse</b> <b>propagation.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> was {{previously}} found {{to occur in}} a two-dimensional model of cardiac muscle using the PSpice software program for electronic circuit design and analysis. Longitudinal propagation within each chain, and <b>transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> between parallel chains, occurred even {{when there were no}} gap-junction (g-j) channels inserted between the simulated myocardial cells either longitudinally or transversely. In those studies, there were pronounced edge (boundary) effects and end-effects even within single chains. Transverse velocity increased with increase in model size. The present study was performed to examine boundary effects on <b>transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> velocity when the length of the chains was held constant at 10 cells and the number of parallel chains was varied from 3 to 5, to 7, to 10, and to 20. The number of g-j channels was either zero, both longitudinally and transversely (0 / 0), or 100 / 100. Some experiments were also made at 100 / 0, 1 / 1, and 10 / 10. Transverse velocity and overall velocity (both longitudinal and transverse components) was calculated from the measured total propagation time (TPT), i. e., the elapsed time between when the first action potential (AP) and the last AP crossed the zero potential level. The transverse g-j channels were placed only at the ends of each chain, such that propagation would occur in a zigzag pattern. Electrical stimulation was applied intracellularly between cells A 1 and A 2. It was found that, with no g-j channels (0 / 0), overall velocity increased almost linearly when more and more chains were placed in parallel. In contrast, with many g-j channels (100 / 100), there was a much flatter relationship between overall velocity and number of parallel chains. The difference in velocities with 0 / 0 channels and 100 / 100 channels was reduced as the number of chains was increased. In conclusion, edges have important effects on propagation velocity (overall and transverse) in cardiac muscle simulations. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The damage {{process of}} {{transverse}} cracks in cross-ply and quasi-isotropic toughened CFRP laminates under static loading is studied. To investigate specimen configuration effect on width-direction <b>propagation</b> of <b>transverse</b> cracks, coupon specimens with ranges of specimen width and transverse ply thickness are tested. Detailed observations of transverse cracks {{indicate that there}} are consecutive three-stage processes of edge crack initiation, edge crack increase without inward propagation, and crack propagation across the width in quasi-isotropic laminates, whereas simultaneous <b>transverse</b> crack <b>propagation</b> takes place across the width in conjunction with new edge crack formation in cross-ply laminates.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} <b>transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> of excitation (cardiac action potentials simulated with PSpice) could {{occur in the}} absence of low-resistance connections (gap – junction channels) between parallel chains of myocardial cells. The transverse transmission of excitation between the chains was strongly dependent on the longitudinal resistance of the interstitial fluid space between the chains: the higher this resistance, the closer the packing of the parallel chains within the bundle. The earlier experiments were carried out with 2 -dimensional sheets of cells: 2 × 3, 3 × 4, and 5 × 5 models (where the first number is the number of parallel chains and the second is the number of cells in each chain). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to enlarge the model size to 7 × 7, thus enabling the transverse velocities to be compared in models of different sizes (where all circuit parameters are identical in all models). This procedure should enable the significance of the role of edge (boundary) effects in <b>transverse</b> <b>propagation</b> to be determined. Results It was found that transverse velocity increased with increase in model size. This held true whether stimulation was applied to the entire first chain of cells or only to the first cell of the first chain. It also held true for retrograde propagation (stimulation of the last chain). The transverse resistance at the two ends of the bundle had almost no effect on transverse velocity until it was increased to very high values (e. g., 100 or 1, 000 megohms). Conclusion Because the larger the model size, the smaller the relative edge area, we conclude that the edge effects slow the transverse velocity. </p...|$|E
