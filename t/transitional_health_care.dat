40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to a better understanding of Chinese <b>health</b> <b>care</b> regulation in an era of transition. It describes the major <b>health</b> <b>care</b> regulatory institutions operating currently in China and analyzes the underlying factors. The paper argues that in the transition from a planned to a market economy, the Chinese government has been employing a hybrid approach where both old and new institutions have a role in the management of emerging markets, including the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> market. This approach is consistent with the incremental reform strategy adopted by the Party-state. Although a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> regulatory framework has gradually taken shape, the framework is incomplete, with a particular lack of emphasis on professional self-regulation. In addition, its effectiveness is limited despite the existence of many regulatory institutions. In poor rural areas, the effectiveness of the regulatory framework is further undermined or distorted by the extremely difficult financial position that local governments find themselves in. The interpretations of the principle of 'rule of law' by policy makers and officials at different levels and the widespread informal network of relations between known individuals (Guanxi) play an important role in the operation of the regulatory framework. The findings of this paper reveal the complex nature of regulating <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in <b>transitional</b> China.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Young people's {{transition}} from {{child and adolescent}} (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS). OBJECTIVES: To systematically review evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} different models of CAMHS-AMHS transitional care, service user and staff perspectives, and facilitators of/barriers to effective CAMHS-AMHS transition. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search in May 2012 of Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, Health Business Elite, HMIC, Cochrane Database, Web of Science and ASSIA; ancestral searches; and consultation with experts in the field. STUDY SELECTION: Qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods primary research on the CAMHS-AMHS health-care transition of young people (aged 16 - 21 years) with mental health problems. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently completed a standardised data extraction form and critically evaluated identified documents using a validated appraisal tool for empirical studies with varied methodologies. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies of variable quality were identified. None were randomised or case-controlled trials. Studies incorporating service user/carer perspectives highlighted the need to tackle stigma and provide accessible, age-appropriate services. Parents/carers wanted more involvement with AMHS. Transitional care provision was considered patchy and often not prioritised within mental health services. There was no clear evidence of superior effectiveness of any particular model. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality evidence of transitional care models is lacking. Data broadly support the development of programmes that address the broader transitional care needs of 'emerging adults' and their mental health needs but further evaluation is necessary. Developing robust <b>transitional</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> will require the policy-practice gap to be addressed and development of accessible, acceptable, responsive, age-appropriate provision...|$|R
40|$|Ineffective {{transitional}} care programs for ensuring {{the continuation of}} care from the hospital setting to the home setting often result in rehospitalization for elderly heart failure patients age 65 and older. The purpose of this project {{was to develop a}} home <b>health</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>care</b> program for elderly patients transitioning from inpatient settings to home settings using care bundles consisting of evidence-based practices to reduce preventable rehospitalizations within 30 days of discharge. The home-based chronic care model, which provides a foundation for home health 2 ̆ 7 s integral role in chronic disease management by ensuring patient-centered evidence-based care, guided the development of this program. The developmental process elicited feedback from a team of home health advisory members, 3 home health experts, and 2 <b>health</b> <b>care</b> consumers who may use this program in the future. The readability of the program was at a 5 th grade level for easy comprehension. A 3 -item survey was given to 2 members from the target population, and a 5 -item survey was given to 3 content experts to evaluate the transitional program. The advisory members were asked to read and provide feedback on the {{transitional care}} program. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to obtain a content validity ratio score of 1. 00.

The connection between frequent attendance and specific morbidities {{in the health}} care systems in transitional Europe has been underestimated. We investigated whether frequent visits of chronic patients in primary care are related to characteristic of chronic disease (diabetes mellitus) and whether this is influenced by the family practice in the <b>transitional</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> We analyzed the number of visits a day time work for 490 persons with diabetes in the period 1997 to 2000. As the cut-off points between frequent attenders and non frequent attenders (NFAs) we used the value of the third quartile (Q 3) of visits determined for the sex and age groups in the parallel study in the whole population. The analysis was performed for 23 variables: demographic characteristics of patients, disease characteristic and variables of physician. Logistic regressions were employed to identify the predictors of FAs/NFAs. 56. 9 % (in 1997) to 62. 4 % (in 2000) persons with diabetes were FAs, compared to 22. 4 % to 24. 3 % FAs patients in the whole population. Logistic regression analysis significantly differentiated the two group of visits with 68 % accuracy. 4 variables are significant predictors for FAs/NFAs: diabetes as the main disease (p = 0. 0005), diet-only-treatment (p = 0. 0062), treatment by secondary care (p = 0. 0116), and if glycated hemoglobin test (HbA 1 c) is determined (p = 0. 0272).

40|$|Making {{health care}} {{services}} accessible to everyone is a duty imposed by the Constitution, yet it {{remains one of the}} greatest challenges to our <b>transitional</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. Legislation aimed at improving access to health care has increased over the last few years, testing health workers ’ ability to practically implement such laws. Children are a particularly vulnerable group within society and should have their health needs addressed at all levels of service provision. However, in most instances children are unable to access necessary {{health care services}} on their own and require the prior consent of a legally qualified third party in order to obtain health care. Health legislation further restricts children’s ability to consent by setting age limitations resulting in the suspension or prevention of access to health care services for many children in South Africa. Once it is operational, the long awaited Children’s Act will increase access to health care for children by lowering the age of consent but it is also likely to add to existing implementation challenges currently faced by health care workers.

Thanks to the advances in medical care and technology, many persons with PWS live longer and survive to adulthood. Currently, because of the many physical and behavioral manifestations, <b>transitional</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> is not easy for these patients and is considered a very important issue. Moreover, very few studies have examined these transitional problems in young adults with PWS. In recent years, there has been great interest in improving transition planning and support for young people with PWS reaching adulthood. In this article, we underline the main clinical problems in transition and give some advice to make this period less difficult and easier for adolescents with PWS. Special attention should be paid to obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, and sleep apnea during the period of transition. In PWS, for an effective transition from childhood to adulthood, a multidisciplinary team is needed, and should maintain the same approach to food, environment, and psychiatric issues. For comprehensive care, it is necessary to involve adult endocrinologists and other medical specialists in conjunction with the pediatric team. Parental involvement is, however, a great help for supervising adolescents with PWS during this particular period. Keywords: Prader–Willi, transition period, intellectual disabilitie...|$|E

The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} quality of primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services in Albania based on physicians' perceptions towards the quality of the services provided to the general population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in January-March 2013 including a representative sample of 132 physicians (59 men aged 41. 3 ± 6. 9 years and 73 women aged 43. 7 ± 4. 8 years; overall response rate: 132 / 150 = 88 %) providing primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services in several polyclinics (health centers) of Tirana, the Albanian capital city. A structured self-administered and anonymous questionnaire was applied including physicians' perceptions regarding different dimensions of the quality of primary <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association of self-perceived quality of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services with baseline characteristics of physicians. RESULTS: Self-perceived adequate quality of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services was positively related to the age of physicians, their working experience, female gender, a lower population served, and specialization in family medicine.

To {{better understand the}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> needs of women, we investigated their knowledge of and perceived barriers to cervical cancer screening. Data reported in the paper arise from nine focus group discussions with 62 women from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.

Thematic analysis identified that the interplay of social and personal barriers influenced women's poor presentation for screening. Inadequate public health education, lack of patient-friendly health services, socio-cultural health beliefs, gender roles, and personal difficulties were the most salient barriers to screening.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} that were early, enthusiastic adopters of Primary <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> often developed an extensive – but eventually dilapidated and under-utilized – network of public clinics at the grassroots. As paradigms and investment patterns of health sector reform have shifted, {{the question of}} what role these public clinics can meaningfully play, and how best to revitalize them, has become important in a number of countries. This paper evaluates the strategy taken by, and outcomes of, a major attempt in Vietnam to revitalize the grassroots infrastructure of primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{against the backdrop of the}} country’s economic transition. The project’s substantial supply-side investments in infrastructure led to marginal increases in utilization and the quality of preventive health services provided by the centers. But because the project failed to take adequate stock of broader, public sector-wide trends and reforms over the transition, the investments had little impact on the incentives, accountability patterns and capacities of clinic staff and the local authorities. Such institutional factors are heavily implicated, in Vietnam as elsewhere, in the substantial and often increasing disparities in service access and quality that continue to afflict <b>transitional</b> <b>health</b> sectors...|$|R

In a cross-sectional study, two domains of QoC and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref questionnaire were combined to collect data from 1, 059 pre-discharge patients in four accredited hospitals (ACCHs) and four non-accredited hospitals (NACCHs) in Saudi Arabia. Health and well-being are often restricted to the characterization of sensory qualities in certain settings such as unrestricted access to healthcare, effective treatment, and social welfare. The patients admitted to tertiary health care facilities are generally able to present themselves with a holistic approach as to how they experience the impact of health policy. The statistical results indicated that patients reported a very limited correlation between QoC and QoL in both settings. The model established a  positive, but ultimately weak and insignificant, association between QoC (access and effective treatment) and QoL (r = 0. 349, P =  0. 000; r = 0. 161, P  =  0. 000, respectively). Even though the two settings are theoretically different in terms of being able to conceptualize, adopt, and implement QoC, the outcomes from both settings demonstrated insignificant relationships with QoL as the results were quite similar. Though modern medicine has substantially improved QoL around the world, this paper proposes that health accreditation has a very limited impact on improv-ing QoL. This paper raises awareness of this topic with multiple healthcare professionals who are interested in correlating QoC and QoL.

It {{analyses}} the microeconomic foundations of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> (characteristics of <b>health</b> {{as an essential}} good, market and government failures in allocation of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services); the role of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{in the process of}} European Union accession; the status of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in Croatia (<b>health</b> status of the population, demographic trends, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> resources); microeconomic and macroeconomic aspects of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing; and recent reform proposals for the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> sector. On this basis a number of recommendations for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform in Croatia are formulated. The proposals refer to financial sustainability of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the medium and long term; the mix of general taxes and mandatory health insurance contributions as sources of public funding; the mix of public and private funding; the impact of different financing instruments on the operations of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers; labour market effects of different financing methods; and the political economy of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} interest in universal <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> {{little is known}} about the optimal way to finance, design, and implement it. This paper attempts to fill this gap by providing some general policy recommendations on this important issue. While most of the paper addresses the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) countries, its policy implications are applicable to any country. The paper finds that the best financing option is country-specificÂ¯depending on a country’s economic, cultural, institutional, demographic and epidemiological characteristics, as well as political economy considerations. However, taxation should be the primary financing source. It also concludes that an appropriate and realistic benefit package would need to be designed to ensure the system’s financial viability. Regarding the optimal way to implement universal <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> certain preconditions are needed, including sound public administration, a small informal economy, and a transparent health financing system that builds social consensus.
