25|$|Wicca is a neo-pagan {{religion}} {{focused on}} nature, {{guided by the}} philosophy of Wiccan Rede that advocates Harm None, Do As Ye Will. The concept of karmic return in Wicca states that our deeds return to us threefold, or multiple times <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> lessons (The Threefold Law), whether in this lifetime or the next. Reincarnation therefore is an accepted part of the Wiccan faith. Wiccans also believe in death and afterlife as important experiences for the soul to transform and prepare for future lifetimes.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|However, in {{the face}} of the loss of his daughter, Mac learns, in Briley's words, that [...] "his life as a Christian is no more {{sheltered}} from this world's tragedies than it was before." [...] Before finding redemption, Sledge questions why God has allowed his life to take the path it has and, in particular, why his daughter was killed instead of him. Commentators have described this as a prime example of theodicy, the question of why evil exists that is commonly faced by Christians. Scholar Richard Leonard writes, [...] "For all believers, the meaning of suffering is the universal question.... No answer is completely satisfying, least of all the idea that God sends bad events <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> something." [...] Following the death of his daughter, Mac moves forward with uncertainty as the film ends. Jewett writes of this conclusion, [...] "The message of this film is that we have no final assurances, any more than Abraham did. But we can respond in faith to the tender mercies we have received." ...|$|E

50|$|Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s book {{of advice}} on education, Émile, was first {{published}} in 1762. Émile, the imaginary pupil he uses for illustration, was only to learn what he could appreciate as useful. He was to enjoy his lessons, and learn to rely on his own judgement and experience. “The tutor must not lay down precepts, he must let them be discovered,” wrote Rousseau, and urged him not make Émile learn science, but let him discover it. He also said that we should not substitute books for personal experience because this does not <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> reason; it <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> use other people’s reasoning; it <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> believe a great deal but never to know anything.|$|R

25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections.

60|$|How to live?--that is the {{essential}} question for us. Not how {{to live in the}} mere material sense only, but in the widest sense.

And this being the great thing needful for us to learn, is, by consequence, the great thing which education has <b>to</b> <b>teach.</b> <b>To</b> prepare <b>us</b> for complete living is the function which education has to discharge; and the only rational mode of judging of an educational course is, to judge in what degree it discharges such function.|$|R
