50|$|The F-22 Demonstration and Heritage Flight Team is an American flight {{demonstration}} team {{stationed at}} the home of Air Combat Command at Langley AFB in Hampton, Virginia, VA. The team flies the USAF's Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor at airshows around the globe, performing air maneuvers that demonstrate the supermaneuverability of the F-22. These demonstrations include the power loop, split, and <b>tail</b> <b>slide,</b> as well as a high speed pass and dedication pass. These maneuvers are based on those designed for combat operations, but are performed at much lower altitudes than most pilots are certified to fly at.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} the 1,628 cc four-cylinder {{water-cooled}} unit which by now powered the 7C {{version of the}} manufacturer's Traction passenger car, which also provided the van's three-speed manual transmission and front torsion-bar suspension and (still innovative) front-wheel drive drive-train. The van's rear suspension came from a very simple leaf-spring arrangement. The 1020 kg carrying capacity was a little greater than had initially been envisaged by Boulanger, which presumably led to a firming of the rear suspension settings. The light weight of the van's body, the lack of weight balance resulting from positioning the engine and driver at the extreme front of the vehicle and the very rudimentary nature of the rear suspension meant that drivers quickly learned that without {{the weight of a}} load in the van, it was excessively prone to <b>tail</b> <b>slide.</b> The hydraulic braking system also came from the Traction, though the drum brakes were the slightly larger ones from the 1911 cc Traction 11 version.|$|E
5000|$|Under the bonnet the 100E still housed an antiquated, but {{actually}} new, [...] side-valve engine sharing the {{bore and stroke}} of the old unit but now with larger bearings and inlet valves and pump-assisted cooling. The three-speed gearbox was retained. Some models were fitted with a semi-automatic [...] "Manumatic" [...] gearbox. A second wind-screen wiper was now included at no extra cost, although the wipers' vacuum-powered operation was also retained: by now this was seen as seriously old-fashioned and the wipers were notorious for slowing down when driving up steep hills, or coming to a complete rest when trying to overtake. The separate chassis construction of the previous models was replaced by unitary construction and the front suspension used [...] "hydraulic telescopic dampers and coil springs" [...] - now called MacPherson struts, a term {{that had not yet}} entered the public lexicon - with anti-roll bar and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The car's 87 in wheelbase was the shortest of any Anglia, but the front and rear track were increased to 48 in, and cornering on dry roads involved a degree of understeer: the steering took just two turns between locks, making the car responsive and easy to place on the road, although on wet roads it was too easy to make the <b>tail</b> <b>slide</b> out. [...] A rare option for 1957 and 1958 was Newtondrive clutchless gearchange. The electrical system became 12 volt.|$|E

5000|$|The Dark slide is a {{seemingly}} complicated looking trick {{in which the}} rider approaches a ledge or rail and does a flip trick onto the obstacle so that the rider lands on the board upside down with their feet on the nose and the <b>tail</b> and <b>slides</b> across the obstacle.

50|$|The two {{aircraft}} had collided {{over the}} town of Vrbovec, northeast of Zagreb, the last five metres of the DC-9's left wing cutting through the Trident's cockpit section and forward passenger compartment. The explosive decompression caused the forward part of the Trident's fuselage to disintegrate; the Trident fell, landing on its <b>tail</b> and <b>sliding</b> a short distance before its remains came to rest. The DC-9, now without over one-third of its left wing, went into an immediate nose-dive and slammed into the ground right-wing first. In the end, everyone aboard both flights was killed.|$|R

5000|$|As a {{defensive}} measure, hagfishes, which resemble eels, produce {{large volumes of}} thick slime when disturbed. A hagfish can remove the excess slime, which can suffocate it {{in a matter of}} minutes, by tying its own body into an overhand knot, then sliding the knot from its head down to the tail. This action scrapes the slime off the fish's body. Hagfish also tie their bodies into overhand knots in order to create leverage to rip off chunks of their prey's flesh, but do so [...] "in reverse" [...] (starting at the <b>tail,</b> and <b>sliding</b> the knot towards the head for mechanical advantage).|$|R

We examine the basic ideas of Bird Meertens Formalism and its application to segment problems. We first give the direct application of Bird Meertens Formalism to the Maximum Segment Sum Problem, and also indicate the underlying concepts involved. We then proceed to give an intuitive proof for the <b>Sliding</b> <b>Tails</b> theorem, and demonstrate how it can be applied to a problem. ...|$|R
50|$|The system {{consists}} of a bullet-trap <b>tail</b> section which <b>slides</b> over the muzzle of the rifle, an explosive midsection and a front standoff rod. The grenade is propelled by a normal ball or tracer round to a maximum range of thirty meters and is detonated by {{the impact of the}} standoff rod against the door to be breached, the standoff distance allowing the blast wave to affect as much of the door surface as possible, negating any need to aim for hinges or locks.|$|R
40|$|We briefly {{review the}} model that {{correlates}} friction between two surfaces in adhesive contact with the loading–unloading adhesion hysteresis between them. We then examine {{in light of this}} model the observed low friction between two mica surfaces coated with a double-chained quaternary ammonium surfactant in intimate adhesive contact in water. This enables us to propose a mechanism for surfactant boundary lubrication in water that is rather different from the classic boundary lubrication in air: in this mechanism, adhesion takes place at the inter-face between the opposing surfactant hydrocarbon <b>tails,</b> whereas frictional <b>sliding</b> takes place at the interface between the hydrated surfactant headgroups and mica. The implications of our findings to biolubrication processes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} an original dynamic experimental installation {{that has been}} designed and developed at RMIT University {{for the evaluation of}} snowboard simulated on-snow performance. The dynamic rig comprises two independent pneumatic cylinders to replicate rider foot movement, as well as three independent adjustable pressure airbags used to simulate the snowboarding terrain by varying their pressure according to the change in the terrain configuration. A custom designed, PLC control system allows for the simulation of common snowboard manoeuvres, from turns of varying board inclination, to nose or <b>tail</b> presses, board <b>slides,</b> and finally the performance of jumps. The PLC programs can be modified or re-written to simulate a variety of terrain features of interest to the investigation. Stress-strain characteristics of the snowboard tested under load are determined using a comprehensive strain gauge system. The paper presents in detail the design of the dynamic experimental installation, rig calibration and testing protocols...|$|R
40|$|Current {{histological}} {{investigation of}} vaginal swabs after alleged sexual assault includes the scoring of spermatozoa (0, + to ++++) and {{the recording of}} visible tails. It is a method that is universally employed. Despite this method being used for 40 years, {{there has never been}} a study investigating its suitability for forensic science. Here, we investigate the reproducibility and subjectivity of sperm scoring among different investigators. Dilutions of seminal fluid were randomly distributed onto 20 slides, stained with haematoxylin/eosin and assessed by 37 investigators, over 2 years. Slides were assessed for levels of spermatozoa and the presence of <b>tails.</b> Each <b>slide</b> was scored by a minimum of 25 investigators. On no slide was there a consensus between all scores. Standard deviation remained below 1, but relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 6 to 105 % in a positive correlation as the average score decreased. Spermatozoa were not observed 56 times (9. 6 %) and 27 investigators (73 %) did not observe spermatozoa on at least one <b>slide.</b> Spermatozoa with <b>tails</b> were observed on every slide by at least 10 examiners, but as the average score of the slide decreased, so did the observation of tails. The current sperm scoring method is highly subjective with a particularly high %RSD in slides with low overall sperm counts. Moreover, the recording of tails does not add value to the current technique of sperm scoring. Further research might improve the objectivity of sperm scoring and the reliability of recording of tails...|$|R
40|$|Dynein {{is a huge}} multisubunit {{microtubule}} (MT) -based motor, whose motor domain {{resides in}} the heavy chain. The heavy chain comprises a ring of six AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) modules with two slender protruding domains, the tail and stalk. It has been proposed that during the ATP hydrolysis cycle, this tail domain swings against the AAA ring as a lever arm to generate the power stroke. However, there is currently no direct {{evidence to support the}} model that the tail swing is tightly linked to dynein motility. To address {{the question of whether the}} power stroke of the <b>tail</b> drives MT <b>sliding,</b> we devised an in vitro motility assay using genetically biotinylated cytoplasmic dyneins anchored on a glass surface in the desired orientation with a biotin–streptavidin linkage. Assays on the dyneins with the site-directed biotin tag at eight different locations provided evidence that robust MT sliding is driven by the power stroke of the tail. Furthermore, the assays revealed slow MT sliding independent of dynein orientation on the glass surface, which is mechanically distinct from the sliding driven by the power stroke of the tail...|$|R
40|$|Nucleosome Remodeling Factor (NURF) is an ATP-dependent {{nucleosome}} remodeling {{complex that}} alters chromatin structure by catalyzing nucleosome sliding, thereby exposing DNA sequences previously associated with nucleosomes. We systematically studied how the unstructured N-terminal residues of core histones (the N-terminal histone <b>tails)</b> influence nucleosome <b>sliding.</b> We used bacterially expressed Drosophila histones to reconstitute hybrid nucleosomes lacking {{one or more}} histone N-terminal tails. Unexpectedly, we found that removal of the N-terminal tail of histone H 2 B promoted uncatalyzed nucleosome sliding during native gel electrophoresis. Uncatalyzed nucleosome mobility was enhanced by additional removal of other histone tails but was not affected by hyperacetylation of core histones by p 300. In addition, {{we found that the}} N-terminal tail of the histone H 4 is specifically required for ATP-dependent catalysis of nucleosome sliding by NURF. Alanine scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that H 4 residues 16 -KRHR- 19 are critical for the induction of nucleosome mobility, revealing a histone tail motif that regulates NURF activity. An exchange of histone tails between H 4 and H 3 impaired NURF-induced sliding of the mutant nucleosome, indicating that the location of the KRHR motif in relation to global nucleosome structure is functionally important. Our results provide functions for the N-terminal histone tails in regulating the mobility of nucleosomes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} that {{inhalation}} of carbonaceous particulate matter from increases susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. In vitro studies report that phagocytosis of carbon black by alveolar macrophages (AM) impairs killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We therefore aimed to use a mouse model {{to test the hypothesis}} that high levels of carbon loading of AM in vivo increases susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia. We also want to develop an air-tissue interface model to assess DNA damage to airway macrophages due to inhalation of manufactured nanoparticals. Methods: Female outbred mice were treated with either intranasal phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or ultrafine carbon black (UF-CB in PBS; 500 μg on day 1 and day 4), and then infected with S. pneumoniae strain D 39 on day 5. Survival was assessed over 72 h. The effect of UF-CB on AM carbon loading, airway inflammation, and a urinary marker of pulmonary oxidative stress was assessed in uninfected animals. The human monocyte cell line Mono Mac 6 and primary alveolar macrophages were used to assess DNA damage. To measure DNA damage in macrophages, we used the alkaline Comet assay.

40|$|In many insects, sperm {{cells are}} {{produced}} in bundles {{with their heads}} being held together by a glycoprotein matrix secreted by a cyst cell. Mature sperm cells in the seminal vesicles are usually free, but in sawflies and several other insects, such structures (spermatodesmata) remain intact and sperm cells may be ejaculated as bundles. Here we report the occurrence of spermatodesmata in mature males of the ant Lasius pallitarsis. Microscopic investigations of the abdominal contents of males immediately prior to their nuptial flights showed that the anterior ends of numerous sperm cells were embedded in an oval-shaped 20 by 30 micrometer extracellular fibrous cap. Individual sperm ranged in length from 55 to 75 micrometers with an average overall length of 65 micrometers. The bulb-shaped heads of the sperm were relatively small, only about 1. 5 micrometers in length and about 1. 1 micrometers in diameter. The diameter of the sperm tails was approximately 1 micrometer. Observations of live preparations of the spermatodesmata showed increasingly active undulating wave-like movement of the sperm <b>tails</b> as the <b>slide</b> preparations aged. This {{appears to be the}} first case of sperm bundles being present in the seminal vesicles of mature ant males – males that are immediately poised to complete their nuptial mating flight...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} {{of the dynamics of}} a time series requires construction of the transition density. We explain why 1 -point densities and scaling exponents cannot determine the class of stochastic dynamics. Time series require some sort of underlying statistical regularity to provide a basis for analysis, and we construct an exhaustive list of such tests. The condition for stationary increments, not scaling, determines the existence of long time pair autocorrelations. We conjecture that for a selfsimilar process neither the pair correlations nor the 2 -point density scales in both times t and s except in a pathological case, and give examples using three well-known Gaussian processes. An incorrect assumption of stationary increments can generate spurious stylized facts, including fat <b>tails.</b> When a <b>sliding</b> window is applied to nonstationary, uncorrelated increments then a Hurst exponent Hs =  1  /  2 is generated by that procedure even if the underlying model scales with a Hurst exponent H [not equal to]  1 / 2. We explain how this occurs dynamically. The nonstationarity arises from systematic unevenness in the traders' behavior in real time. Spurious stylized facts arise mathematically from using a log increment with a 'sliding window' to read the series. In addition, we show that nonstationary processes are generally not globally transformable to stationary ones. We also present a more detailed explanation of our recent FX data analysis and modeling.

After nanoparticle exposure, a total of 100 macrophages were analysed per sample, as n= 50 duplicate <b>slides.</b> <b>Tail</b> length, percentage of DNA in the tail of the comet (% tail DNA), tail extent moment and olive tail moment, were calculated for each cell using the Komet Analysis software. Results: Instillation of UF-CB in mice resulted high levels of carbon loading in alveolar macrophages. In uninfected animals, UF-CB treated animals had increased urinary 8 -oxodG (P = 0. 055), and an increased airway neutrophil differential count (P < 0. 01). All PBS-treated mice died within 72 h after infection with S. pneumoniae, whereas morbidity and mortality after infection was reduced in UF-CB treated animals (median survival 48 h vs. 30 h, P < 0. 001). At 24 hr post-infection, UF-CB treated mice had lower lung and the blood S. pneumoniae colony forming unit counts, and lower airway levels of keratinocyte-derived chemokine/growth-related oncogene (KC/GRO), interferon gamma(IFN-γ) and other inflammatory cytokines. No increase in DNA damage was observed when cells were placed in the nitrogen gas flow for 10 mins compared with cells placed in air (insert control vs air control). Exposure to nanoparticles from all three metals for 10 min caused a significant increase in DNA damage in human Mono Mac 6 cells compared to insert control. There {{was no significant difference between}} DNA damage caused by gold (Au), silver (Ag) and Iron (Fe) nanoparticles. Conclusion: Acute high level loading of AM with ultrafine carbon black particles per se does not increase the susceptibility of mice to pneumococcal infection in vivo. We found significant DNA damage in macrophages cultured for 24 h with doses of up to 10 mg/cm² aerosolized iron, gold or silver nanoparticles.
