The tractors were of the same engine power as well as type of gearbox (PowerShift – gears full shifted while loaded). We were dealing with the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> John Deere 8320 and crawler tractor John Deere 8320 RT. The measurement was implemented in the land register of Vrbovec (Znojmo region) {{in an area where}} green peas were grown as the main product and winter wheat as the preceding crop. The measured and the counterproductive tractors were interconnected by the rope containing strain-gauge force sensors. The <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> was decelerated by the tractor crawler. The tractor crawler was decelerated by two <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractors.</b> The <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor’s</b> stress-strain properties were also measured applying two pressure rating alternatives. Variant A presented inflation pressure of 160 kPa on the front axle and of 140 kPa on the rear axle. Variant B applied inflation pressure of 120 kPa on the front axle and of 100 kPa on the rear axle. Measured and calculated findings reveal that the tractor crawler achieved higher drawbar power and lower specific tractive consumption and traction slip than the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> with both variants of inflation. Comparing the stress-strain characteristics of the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> with a different tire inflation illustrates that using variant B, higher drawbar power and lower specific tractive consumption and traction slip were measured...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of tires {{was to determine the}} dynamic rolling radius and to apply it to wheel slip calculations with special respect to vertical wheel load and to tire inflation pressure. It is typical of mechanical four-wheel drive tractors that there is a definite additional power in the tractor power chain. This additional power is dependent on the difference between the front wheel and rear wheel peripheral speeds. Further-more, the purpose was to determine the effect of additional slip on four-wheel drive tractors operated without drawbar pull. Experiments were performed on asphalt surfaces and fields. A new measurement method was developed, and a device was constructed for the implementation of <b>three</b> <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel</b> drive operational modes (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive). As the result of the experiments, a relationship was found to describe the dynamic rolling radius for low-profile radial tires tested on rigid road surfaces.

This phenomenon appears only on hard roads and soil surfaces with high adhesion coefficients and only within the low drawbar pull range...|$|R

Mechatronic diagnostic systems identify the machine’s actual operating load in different operatingmodes and under specific circumstances. Knowledge engineering methods {{have not yet been}} developed in the process of diagnosing a tractor’sdefects, but they seem to offer almost endless possibilities. A defect is defined as every event whichhas an adverse effect on tractor performance and which should be detected in the diagnostic processwith an indication of the type and place of damage as well as the magnitude and variability of damageover time. Diagnostic knowledge is a symbolic representation of empirical relations based on whichdiagnostic procedures are developed. The identification of diagnostic relations based on different methods and information sources willfoster the growth of reliable declarative knowledge comprising facts and state-symptom diagnosticrelations, as well as procedural knowledge which underlies diagnostic inference. The determination of symptom-damage relations requires a knowledge base of potential defects in theassemblies and subassemblies of a <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor.</b> A diagnostic knowledge base can be created based on the identified diagnostic relations, including data acquired during damage simulations. The identification of diagnostic relations between specific defects and the corresponding parameterswas one of the key steps {{in the process of developing}} a mechatronic diagnostic system in a wheeledtractor.
