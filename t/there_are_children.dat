25|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} festivity in the Swedish calendar, or perhaps for many the most important, is Midsummer, midsommar. Midsummer's Eve is celebrated {{on the eve of}} the Friday between the 20 and 26 June. Most Swedes try upon this day to get to a place in the countryside where they can eat pickled herring, boiled potatoes and sour cream as well as strawberries and brännvin. A maypole is often erected around which, at least if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>children</b> present at the celebration, dancing is performed. Houses are often decorated in birch twigs.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Kooman {{first became}} aware of the issue of human {{trafficking}} while he was working for the Christian nonprofit organization Youth With A Mission (YWAM) in southeast Malaysia, where he met child victims of human trafficking, but Kooman later came to realize that human trafficking is an issue in Canada as well; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimate that between 600 and 800 people are trafficked into Canada every year. Kooman has spoken about the cases in which people have been trafficked into Calgary and Edmonton in order to work in the sex industry, and has posited that sex workers have likely been trafficked into his hometown of Red Deer as well since it is also located along Alberta Highway 2. Kooman continued to work in Malaysia with YWAM for two years, towards the end of which time he visited Singapore, where he attended an international conference on human trafficking, there learning details on the issue that shocked him. The conference focused on the military use of children and the prostitution of children. One of the facts that stuck with Kooman was that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>children</b> aged five and under who are forcibly prostituted daily, and that many of these children end up spending their entire lives as human trafficking victims. Kooman is the director of Raise Their Voice, a creative, justice-driven, nonprofit organisation in Red Deer. The other four members of the organization are his family members.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} said ... about birth control. I {{like to think of}} the {{positive}} side of the equation, of the meaning and sanctity of life, of the purpose of this estate in our eternal journey, of the need for the experiences of mortal life under the great plan of God our Father, of the joy that is to be found only where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>children</b> in the home, of the blessings that come of good posterity. When I think of these values and see them taught and observed, then I am willing to leave the question of numbers to the man and the woman and the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|Many stations, {{including}} WCAU and Pennsylvania's Group W stations KYW and KDKA, froze {{the action}} {{just prior to}} the gunshot. However, the latter two allowed the audio of the shooting to continue under the frozen image. Group W's news cameraman William L. [...] "Bill" [...] Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth. Only a handful aired the unedited press conference. WPVI in Philadelphia re-broadcast the suicide footage in full on their 5p.m. and 6p.m. Action News broadcast without a warning to viewers. That station's broadcast is a source for copies circulating on the Internet. WPXI in Pittsburgh is reported by the Associated Press to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast. In explaining the decision to air, WPXI operations manager By Williams said, [...] "It's an important event [...] an important man." [...] Williams avoided airing the footage in the evening newscasts, explaining, [...] "Everyone knows by then that he did it. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>children</b> out of school." [...] However, in central Pennsylvania, many children were home from school during the day of Dwyer's suicide due to a snowstorm, and Harrisburg TV station WHTM-TV opted to broadcast uncut video of the suicide twice that day, defending the decision (despite hundreds of viewer complaints afterward) due to the important nature of the story.|$|E

2500|$|... "Traitor's Gate" [...] {{was written}} by Howard Brenton. He was pleased to be chosen to write the episode, as he got to write the pivotal part of the episode when Tom reveals to Ellie {{that he is a}} spy. During the writing, Brenton was simply told in a note that [...] "he tells her", and had to work out how. Brenton chose to adopt the same writing style based on the early episodes of Taggart; Brenton was {{impressed}} by the way the episodes seemed to have more to the plot half way through. The location where Tom and Salter meet {{in the middle of the}} episode was to be set in the Millennium Dome; this would later change to North Greenwich tube station. The scene had to be rewritten several times to reflect Tom questioning Salter's allegiance. Much of the scene was actually automated dialogue replacement. Later on, Brenton wanted to figure out how Salter would evade Danny and Zoe; when he couldn't figure it out, he asked a source for help, who simply suggested him to have Salter call the Police about Zoe and Danny having sex in their car and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>children</b> about. The introduction of Tessa being corrupt by running phantom agents was allegedly based in real life situations. In the series, the idea was made on the concept that MI5 officers have temptations to make money. The written scenes where Salter confesses to Tom was somewhat inspired by Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The scene was for the two to act as friends rather than interrogator and suspect.|$|E
