Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the <b>taint</b> <b>of</b> his mother's divorce.

50|$|Field {{dressing}} (verb) is {{the act of}} minimally dressing (butchering) {{an animal}} in {{a way as to}} reduce the amount of weight that must be carried by removing the rumen ("gutting"), and sometimes other internal organs such as the heart.

By 1957 the professionals were in the ascendancy, but momentum had been lost and the code was subject to a major split and suspension by FIFA for the poaching of players from European clubs without paying transfer fees.

By allowing an arbitrary number <b>of</b> <b>taint</b> labels to be stored for every tainted byte, accurate taint propagation can be achieved for values that are derived from multiple input bytes.

The basic theory <b>of</b> <b>taint</b> tracing and multi-label taint propagation is discussed, as well as the main concepts <b>of</b> implementing a <b>taint</b> tracing tool using dynamic binary instrumentation. The impact <b>of</b> multi-label <b>taint</b> propagation on performance and precision is evaluated.

500|$|Between 1685 and 1785 this Chapman Horse/Andalusian/Barb cross {{developed}} into the original Cleveland Bay. During this century the type grew bigger due to better feeding, and by 1785 had developed through selective breeding into the [...] "agricultural type" [...] Cleveland Bay. This original type was heavier and more draft-like than the breed of today. This {{was due to}} a need for strength more than speed on the farms and poor roads of 17th- and 18th-century England. As roads improved and speed became {{more important in the}} late 18th century, Thoroughbred and Arabian blood was added. The resulting horses were used extensively as coach horses, and were lighter of frame, with a well-arched neck and powerful shoulders, making for a flashy carriage horse. The Thoroughbred blood was added despite the claims of breeders that the Cleveland Bay was [...] "free from <b>taint</b> <b>of</b> black or blood", meaning either Thoroughbred [...] "blood" [...] or the Old English [...] "Black" [...] and its descendents.
