5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{later found}} out that when the {{material}} was recorded, Wilson had taken LSD. [...] "I've <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> [...] must have been thinking", Zappa recounted, [...] "sitting in that control room, listening to all that weird shit {{coming out of the}} speakers, and being responsible for telling the engineer, Ami Hadani (who was not on acid), what to do." [...] By the time Freak Out! was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E

500|$|The Softwire is {{actually}} a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood. As a teenager, he worked at his parents' ceramic factory during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a kiln room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, {{there is a more}} prominent influence on the premise of The Softwire—that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in New York, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Haarsma [...] witnessed immigrants struggling to get by. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is this journey (and struggle) that is prevalent in The Softwire.|$|E
500|$|The vocals {{and lyrics}} were {{provided}} by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video game projects such as the Etrian Odyssey arrange albums. The Monaca team had met her when considering her for a prior project, and Okabe {{wanted to work with}} her on Nier. She was approached {{a few months after the}} initial meeting in Autumn 2008 to be the vocalist for the soundtrack. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Scottish Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Scottish Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote [...] "Song of the Ancients" [...] in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
2500|$|At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further {{elaborated}} on the story's creation, [...] "I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> a real Nazi {{might be}} like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy {{for its own}} sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't {{meant to be a}} political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted me to feel sorry for them as well." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{wondered}} if the storm was as bad on the river and in the Boy's Town, and whether the lightning would strike the boat or the house; the house had a lightning-rod, but the boat could not have one, of course.

60|$|They all begged eagerly for the end, but Bud was hoarse {{and must}} go to sleep; so every one went away {{to talk about this}} new and charming {{creature}} who had come to make the long nights pleasant.

60|$|He {{fixed his}} eyes upon the forest, where all again was silent. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> {{was going on}} there--the lines of troops forming to attack, the guns being pushed forward by hand {{to the edge of}} the open. He fancied he could see their black muzzles {{protruding}} from the undergrowth, ready to deliver their storm of missiles--such missiles as the one whose shriek had so unsettled his nerves. The distension of his eyes became painful; a mist seemed to gather before them; he could no longer see across the field, yet would not withdraw his gaze lest he see the dead man at his side.|$|E
60|$|At last Rovinski {{emerged into}} the cave of light. There he stopped, the car hanging some twenty or thirty feet above the bottom.

If {{he had not seen}} it, he would have thought he had come out into the upper air of some {{bottomless}} cavern. But a great iron machine nearly twenty feet long could not rest upon air! He thought he might be dreaming; he sat up and shut his eyes; in a few minutes he would open them and see if he still saw the same incomprehensible things.|$|E

50|$|One day at work, Markus, a {{subordinate}} on her work-team (unseen until now) enters her office {{to discuss a}} case, and she, in a trance-like state, just walks {{up to him and}} passionately kisses him.

6000|$|So it {{was that}} war began upon Goat Island. It lasted {{a day and a}} night, the longest day and the longest night in Bert's life. He had to lie close and listen and watch. Also he had to scheme what he should do. It was clear now that he had to kill these two men if he could, and that if they could, they would kill him. The prize was first food and then the flying-machine and the {{doubtful}} privilege of trying' to ride it. If one failed, one would certainly be killed; if one succeeded, one would get away somewhere over there. For a time Bert <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it was like over there.

60|$|He {{waited until}} he saw her safely on the trolley car, and then drove slowly homeward {{in a state of}} amazement. He had been on the verge of announcing himself to the family in Fillmore Street as her {{prospective}} husband! He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> that household was like; and again he found himself wondering why she had not consented to his proposal. And the ever-recurring question presented itself--was he prepared to go that length? He didn't know. She was beyond him, he had no clew to her, she was to him as mysterious as a symphony. Certain strains of her moved him intensely--the rest was beyond his grasp.... At supper, while his children talked and laughed boisterously, he sat silent, restless, and in spite of their presence the house seemed appallingly empty.|$|E

When I saw a real diamond in a lady's ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of course, it was very lovely but it wasn't my idea of a diamond.
