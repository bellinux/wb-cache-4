40|$|We {{look at the}} {{stability}} of survey based subjective <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> over <b>time</b> using data from a Dutch panel survey with a long time horizon and find that the ranking of individual <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> is stable. Simple observation of the aggregated measured <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> reveals instability in aggregated preferences. In order {{to shed light on}} this instability we look at the relationship between the individual socio-economic situation and <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> and the macroeconomic situation and <b>time</b> <b>preferences.</b> While we find no clear relationship between socio-economic situation and <b>time</b> <b>preferences,</b> we find that for the sample as a whole patience is positively correlated with economic growth, but negatively correlated with income inequality. When studying how the estimations differ across income groups we observe that there is a considerable asymmetry in how different income groups react to changes in the macroeconomic situation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>preferences,</b> the {{willingness}} of decision makers to substitute intertemporally, are not shared or consistent values. They vary across populations, households, individuals and mindsets. Understanding the systematic variability of <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> is crucial for designing effective economic policy, {{especially in light of}} the modern focus on nonstandard models of discounting. This dissertation features a real-world data project that highlights the important interaction between individual differences in preferences and economic policy, a laboratory experiment that showcases the sensitivity of an individual's <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> to environmental factors and a laboratory experiment that validates a field-ready technique for estimating an individual's <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> that is already being implemented by many other researcher...|$|R
30|$|Our review also uncovers how <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> {{relate to}} risky sexual behavior. For example, {{teenagers}} {{have been found}} to greatly discount the future and show little regard for future health consequences, which is why it is important to address risk-taking sexual behaviors. Perhaps {{the most important part of}} this analysis is that by exploring how <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> change with sexual behavior, one could potentially invent ways that would reduce risky sexual behavior by altering <b>time</b> <b>preferences.</b>|$|R
500|$|Fetter notably debated Alfred Marshall, {{presenting}} a theoretical reassessment of land as capital. Fetter's arguments have {{been credited with}} prompting mainstream economists to abandon the Georgist idea [...] "that land is a unique factor of production and hence {{that there is any}} special need for a special theory of ground rent...." [...] A proponent of the subjective theory of value, Fetter emphasized the importance of <b>time</b> <b>preference</b> and rebuffed Irving Fisher for abandoning the pure <b>time</b> <b>preference</b> theory of interest that Fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book, The Rate of Interest.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a long debate on {{equilibrium}} characterization in the negotiation model when players have different <b>time</b> <b>preferences.</b> We show that players behave quite differently under different <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> than under common <b>time</b> <b>preferences.</b> Conventional analysis in this literature relies on the key assumption that all continuation payoffs are bounded from above by the bargaining frontier. However, when players have different <b>time</b> <b>preferences,</b> intertemporal trade may lead to continuation payoffs above the bargaining frontier. We provide a thorough study of this problem without imposing the conventional assumption. Our results tie up all the previous findings, and also clarify the controversies that arose in the past.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} dynamically inconsistent <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> in Rubinstein's (1982) seminal {{model of}} bargaining. When sophisticated bargainers have <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> that exhibit {{a form of}} present bias - satisfied by the hyperbolic and quasi-hyperbolic <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> increasingly common in the economics literature - equilibrium is unique and lacks delay. However, when one bargainer is more patient about a single period's delay from the present than one that occurs in the near future, the game permits a novel form of equilibrium multiplicity and delay. <b>Time</b> <b>preferences</b> with this property have most recently been empirically documented; they can also arise when parties who weight probabilities non-linearly bargain {{under the shadow of}} exogenous breakdown risk, as well as in settings of intergenerational bargaining with imperfect altruism. The paper's main contributions are (i) a complete characterization of the set of equilibrium outcomes and payoffs for separable <b>time</b> <b>preferences,</b> and (ii) present bias as a readily interpretable sufficient condition for uniqueness at the level of individual preferences...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{theories}} {{developed by}} [...] "first wave" [...] Austrian economists {{have long been}} absorbed into mainstream economics. These include Carl Menger's theories on marginal utility, Friedrich von Wieser's theories on opportunity cost, and Eugen Böhm von Bawerk's theories on <b>time</b> <b>preference,</b> as well as Menger and Böhm-Bawerk's criticisms of Marxian economics.|$|E
2500|$|Böhm-Bawerk {{was perhaps}} the most able expositor of Menger's conception. [...] He was further noted for {{producing}} a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing marginal productivity of time and with <b>time</b> <b>preference.</b> (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by Knut Wicksell and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival Irving Fisher.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Cline used a {{discount}} rate of 1.5%. (Cline's summary {{is on the}} project webpage [...] ) [...] He justified his choice of discount rate on the ground of [...] "utility-based discounting", that is there is zero bias in terms of preference between {{the present and the}} future generation (see <b>time</b> <b>preference).</b> Moreover, Cline extended the time frame of the analysis to three hundred years in the future. Because the expected net damage of the global warming becomes more apparent beyond the present generation(s), this choice had the effect of increasing the present-value cost of the damage of global warming as well as the benefit of abatement policies.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we review}} {{published}} studies {{to assess the}} influence of <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> on human health behaviour. Our review indicates that elicited discount rates for health {{have been found to}} be higher than those for money in both the social and private context. We discuss the importance of discount rates for public policy since high time discount rates can contribute to governmental emphasis on acute health care, rather than preventive health care. We then examine how <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> interrelate with specific health concerns such as smoking or obesity. We find that even when <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> are elicited in the monetary domain, they can be successful in predicting smoking cessation and likewise for obesity. We also discuss how <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> relate with teen risk taking behavior.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept in}} {{cardinal}} utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making {{is called the}} [...] "law of diminishing marginal utility" [...] (and {{is also known as}} Gossen's First Law). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. [...] "The law of diminishing marginal utility {{is at the heart of}} the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including <b>time</b> <b>preference</b> and the value of goods (...) The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of heterogeneous <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> on the term structure is {{studied in the}} framework of a continuous-time pure exchange economy, in which agents have, apart from differential <b>time</b> <b>preferences,</b> the same degree of relative risk aversion. A closed-form solution for the financial equilibrium is obtained. In equilibrium, one long-term bond and one short-term bond form a complete market. Agents use these bonds to finance their consumption plans. The long-term bond is bought by agents with a long habitat. The short rate is a weighted average of the short rates which prevail in homogeneous economies populated by one type of agent only. It is shown by example that heterogeneity of <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> can produce additional humps in the yield curve. <b>time</b> <b>preferences,</b> term structure, interest rates, Preferred Habitat Theory, heterogeneity,...|$|R

So can you not leave a penny in a savings account, take a very rapid spaceflight, and come back to earth [...] "many years later" [...] as a billionaire? Hardly any time has passed for you. In essence we are abolishing <b>time</b> <b>preference,</b> or at least allowing people to lower their <b>time</b> <b>preference</b> by spending money on fuel.

40|$|The present research, {{using data}} from 163 undergraduates, {{examines}} the role of optimism on <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> for both losses and gains. It is argued that optimism has asymmetric effects on <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> for gains versus losses: one reason why decision makers prefer immediate gains {{is because they are}} optimistic that these gains will be followed by additional gains in future. In contrast, decision makers prefer to delay losses because they are optimistic that losses are avoidable in the future. Optimism about outcomes affects <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> for both gains and losses, such that low optimism reduces the discount rates while increased optimism is associated with higher discount rates. This prediction was supported in two different domains: monetary outcomes (Study 1), and health (Study 2). Implications of these results for both research practice and <b>time</b> <b>preferences</b> in the real world are discussed...|$|R
