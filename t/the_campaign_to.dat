Seydlitz was towed to Königsberg and scuttled before the advancing Soviet Army could seize the ship. She was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap. Lützow, renamed Petropavlovsk, remained unfinished when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. The ship provided artillery support against advancing German forces until she was sunk in September 1941. She was raised a year later and repaired enough to participate in <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> relieve the Siege of Leningrad in 1944.

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> {{conquer the}} Itza of Petén, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and {{relocate}} the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch'ol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east.

By {{the latter half of}} the 18th century, the local inhabitants consisted entirely of Spaniards, mulattos and others of mixed race, all associated with the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal. There was a drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta due to constant slave raids by the Miskito Sambu of the Caribbean coast that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery in the British colony of Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men and lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E

While in Kansas as early as 2006, residents have suggested the Cairn Terrier as the state dog due to the breed's appearance as Toto in the film The Wizard of Oz. In 2012, Representative Ed Trimmer tabled a bill proposing the Cairn Terrier as a state symbol.|$|E

In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's Konfrontasi, against the newly formed Malaysia.
