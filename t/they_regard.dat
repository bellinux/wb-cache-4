5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

25|$|According to {{both the}} {{official}} Greek position and various public demonstrations in Greece and the Greek diaspora, the Greek Macedonians feel that their right to self-determination is violated by what <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as the monopolisation of their name by a neighbouring country.|$|E
25|$|On occasion, {{one or more}} Creatures {{are asked}} to leave the stadium by police. The {{bleacher}} beer ban in 2000 was blamed on the Creatures, which <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as a false accusation. They have also been accused of heckling rattled musicians in high school bands, which they do not deny.|$|E

25|$|The CEC also {{includes}} the Australian LaRouche Youth Movement (ALYM), the Australian branch of the International LaRouche Youth Movement. It was founded in August 2002, and focusses on the economic thought of Lyndon LaRouche {{as well as what}} <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as Australia's republican tradition, including figures such as John Curtin, King O'Malley, and John Dunmore Lang.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{negligence}} in {{the treatment}} of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death, that <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> the contribution made by his acts as insignificant.|$|E
25|$|Buddhists {{believe that}} peace can be {{attained}} once all suffering ends. <b>They</b> <b>regard</b> all suffering as stemming from cravings (in the extreme, greed), aversions (fears), or delusions. To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace, followers {{in the path}} of the Buddha adhere to a set of teachings called the Four Noble Truths — a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy.|$|E

25|$|The German Government, {{for their}} part, are {{also of the}} opinion that the {{agreement}} at which they have now arrived with His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and which <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as a permanent and definite agreement with effect from to-day between the two Governments, will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on this question between all the naval Powers of the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{dates of}} Patrick's life cannot be fixed with certainty, {{but there is}} broad {{agreement}} that he was active as a missionary in Ireland {{during the second half}} of the 5th century. Early medieval tradition credits him with being the first bishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland, and <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> him as the founder of Christianity in Ireland, converting a society practising a form of Celtic polytheism. He has been generally so regarded ever since, despite evidence of some earlier Christian presence in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Cape Verde is 97% Christian and its {{background}} is {{a fusion of}} African, Asian, European and South American backgrounds, where about 70% is African and mixed. Less than 30% is African, whereas about 1% is of unmixed European descent. Because of this, Cape Verdeans {{find it hard to}} define themselves as either mixed or Africans. <b>They</b> <b>regard</b> themselves as either both or as unique Cape Verdeans. Politically, Cape Verdeans also worked as part of the Portuguese administration, with independence leader Amílcar Cabral being part of the colonial administration in Guinea-Bissau and Angola.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} of the entity holidays is Dan Republike, which commemorates the establishment of Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992. It coincides with Saint Stephen's Day according to the Julian calendar. The Orthodox Serbs also refer to the holiday as the Slava of Republika Srpska, as <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> Saint Stephen as {{the patron saint of}} Republika Srpska. The holiday has therefore a religious dimension, being celebrated with special services in Serbian Orthodox churches. Republika Srpska does not recognize the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1 March).|$|E
25|$|Their {{customary}} {{method of}} trading was by bartering {{one thing for}} another, such as food, cloth, cattle, fowls, lands, houses, fields, slaves, fishing-grounds, and palm-trees (both nipa and wild). Sometimes a price intervened, which was paid in gold, as agreed upon, or in metal bells brought from China. These bells <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as precious jewels; they resemble large pans and are very sonorous. They play upon these at their feasts, and carry them {{to the war in}} their boats instead of drums and other instruments.|$|E
25|$|Society of St. Pius V, {{formed when}} nine priests of the Society of St. Pius X split from that {{organization}} {{over a number}} of issues including using the liturgical reforms implemented under Pope John XXIII. The SSPV maintains that much of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church no longer adheres to the Catholic faith but instead profess a new, or Conciliar religion. <b>They</b> <b>regard</b> the question of the legitimacy of the present hierarchy and the possibility that the Holy See is unoccupied to be unresolved.|$|E

25|$|Popular Resistance Committees is a {{coalition}} {{of a number of}} armed Palestinian groups opposed to what <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as the conciliatory approach of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah towards Israel. The PRC is especially active in the Gaza Strip, through its military wing, the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades. The PRC is said to have an extreme Islamic worldview and operates with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movement. The PRC has carried out several attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers including hundreds of shooting attacks and other rocket and bombing attacks.|$|E
25|$|The nonexistence of {{adolescence}} in the Middle Ages {{served as a}} model for Daenerys's sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books. Many high-born women were married at or below that age because the onset of sexual maturity supposedly turned children into adults. With the Targaryens, the novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep its bloodlines pure; but Martin also portrayed a sociopathic element in the incestuous relationship of the twins Cersei and Jaime Lannister, whose strong bonding inhibits their pairing with others whom <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as inferior.|$|E
25|$|The main {{arguments}} from the mythicists are {{the lack of}} biographical information on Jesus from early Christian and other sources, the so called argument from silence, {{as well as the}} mythical and allegorical nature of the Christ of Paul and the Jesus of the Gospels. Most Christ mythicists agree that the evidence for the existence of a historical Jesus Christ is weak at best, pointing at a series of perceived peculiarities in the sources which <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> as untrustworthy for a historical account and noting the reliance on Jewish writings and the similarities of early Christianity and the Christ figure with the mystery religions of the Greco-Roman world.|$|E
