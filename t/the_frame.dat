40|$|The Asian disease problem (ADP), as a {{demonstration}} of <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> effect, revealed a preference reversal between options perceived as risky and those perceived as certain. This research identifies individuals' involvement level as a moderator of <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> effect. <b>The</b> <b>framing</b> effect in <b>the</b> ADP consisted of emotional choice outcomes regarding human lives. Two studies in this paper demonstrate that when based on emotional choices, <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> effect in high involvement conditions increases in size. Interestingly, this influence of involvement reverses when <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> effect is based on rational choices.

5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{moldboard}} iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles. By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques {{led to the development}} of the heavy moldboard plow, seen in Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the plowshare with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. While <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the top to turn the soil.|$|E

5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended.

30|$|Complexity {{reduction}} is initially obtained with temporal downsampling, since only <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> are conventionally encoded.

Note that if <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> are selected as <b>the</b> reference <b>frames</b> and <b>the</b> WZ <b>frames</b> are <b>the</b> nonreference <b>frames,</b> then <b>the</b> key <b>frames</b> can be coded as conventional I-, P-, or reference B-frames, without drifting errors.
