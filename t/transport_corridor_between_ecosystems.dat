40|$|Biological invasions have {{significant}} ecological, evolutionary and economic consequences. Ants are exemplary invaders and their invasion success is frequently {{attributed to a}} shift in social structure between native and introduced populations. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach to determine the social structure, origin and expansion of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, in Australia by linking behavioural and genetic studies with indicators of dispersal pathways and propagule pressure. Behavioural assays revealed a complete absence of aggression within and between three cities – Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth – spanning 2700 km across Australia. Microsatellite analyses showed intracity genetic homogeneity and limited but significant intercity genetic differentiation. Exceptions were two Perth nests that likely represent independent translocations from Adelaide. These patterns suggest efficient local gene flow with more limited jump dispersal via <b>transport</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>between</b> cities. Microsatellite analyses of L. humile from potential source regions, combined with data from port interceptions, trade pathways and the timeline of spread within Australia, implicate the main European supercolony {{as the source of}} L. humile in Melbourne.

40|$|A {{coherent}} and effective Palestinian economy {{is directly related}} to internal connectivity of transport systems within the West Bank and Gaza Strip and between them. In addition, a sound economy needs free international trade and open borders. This paper addresses the current transportation facilities and mobility for people and goods in the West Bank and Gaza. In addition, it provides a historical background on the mobility and transportation conditions in Palestine. Finally the paper addresses transportation options for a viable Palestinian State in the Palestinian areas occupied by Israel in 1967. Various studies that evaluated transport needs for a viable Palestinian State. including studies by the PNA, Israel, and the RAND Arc plan were reviewed. The main internal connectivity transport element recommended in this study is a main backbone corridor in the central West Bank from Jinen to south of Hebron and then crosses Israel south of Beit Awwa to a point south of Beit Hanoun. The corridor continues south along the Gaza Strip eastern border to Yasser Arafat's airport and the Rafah border crossing. A spur to the west, located south of Gaza city that leads to Gaza seaport is also needed. The <b>corridor</b> <b>between</b> the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is recommended to be at-grade level with suitable security measures to protect both Palestinian motorists and Israeli residents along the corridor. It should be under Palestinian control. Short segments of bridges or tunnels may be possible, especially as overpasses or underpasses to Israeli roads and railroads. A continuous bridge or tunnel option is very expensive and could be sabotaged by Israeli extremist. In addition such options (especially a tunnel) could stress drivers and in case of major accidents the corridor could be closed for extended periods. The study also emphasized that the Palestinian Himma area occupied in 1967 (which is part of the British Mandate Palestine that was a demilitarized zone between 1949 and 1967 as part of the armistice agreement between Israel and Syria in 1949) {{should be part of the}} Palestinian State.

40|$|Introduction. The Chinese leader Xi Jinping {{presented}} {{the concept of}} the New Silk Road – a collection of land and maritime routes – in autumn 2013. Initially, it envisaged the creation of a network of infrastructural connections, mainly <b>transport</b> <b>corridors,</b> <b>between</b> China and its most important economic partner – Europe. The concept grew in importance throughout 2014 to become the key instrument of China’s foreign policy, especially in the areas of public diplomacy and soft power. Towards the end of 2014, the Chinese government announced it would establish a Silk Road Fund worth US$ 40 billion. The New Silk Road idea is a flexible formula used by China in its dialogue with many other countries. Its inclusive nature helps contribute to diluting the negative impression caused by China’s rapid economic expansion and assertiveness in foreign policy, especially with regard to its neighbours. The process of implementing the New Silk Road concept will allow China to expand its influence within its neighbourhood: in Central and South-Eastern Asia. The New Silk Road will be an alternative point of reference to the US dominance and Russian integration projects in these regions. The concept will legitimise and facilitate the growth of China’s influence in the transit countries on the route to Western Europe, i. e. in the Middle East (Arab countries, Israel and Turkey, the Horn of Africa and Central Europe (the Balkans and the Visegrad Group countries). This concept is also essential for China’s domestic policy. It has become one of Xi Jinping’s main political projects. It will boost the development of China’s central and western provinces. The fact that the concept is open and not fully defined means {{that it will be a}} success regardless of the extent to which it will be implemented in practice. Its flexible nature allows China to continue investments already initiated bilaterally and to present them as components of the New Silk Road concept...|$|R
40|$|In {{comparison}} {{with a relatively}} uniform landscape organisms in a complex one {{have to cope with}} a distinctly higher number of problems. On the one hand, the irregular habitat pattern may be inducive to higher biodiversity, on the other isolation of habitats may result in a decrease in species numbers, if extinction is not compensated by immigration. In fractal landscape models, the number of species coexisting in microsites increased up to the fractal dimension of 2. 75, but decreased with higher dimensions (Palmer 1992). Studies on ground beetles in the Netherlands showed a significantly higher proportion of species with high migration potentials in small habitats than in large ones (Vries et al. 1996). In stressed habitats an opposite effect might develop. Thus, Fahrig and Jonson (1998) found an increasing species richness in alfalfa fields with increasing isolation. In diverse landscapes the quality of habitat fringes is, therefore, important for the interactions of habitats through species and the species richness of the habitats. Species interacting between different habitats can also influence ecosystem functions, e. g. seed dispersal or fructification of plants. For the pollinator-plant interaction Steffan-Dewenter and Tscharnke (1999) found that the proportion of large bees and bumblebees was higher in small habitats than in large habitats, which was attributed to the better flying ability of the larger species. Borders <b>between</b> <b>ecosystems</b> (ecotones) may either serve as guidelines for migrating animals or as barriers that inhibit the dispersion of species. <b>Corridors</b> <b>between</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are generally regarded as structural prerequisites to 'optimize the migration into isolated habitats. However, corridors with suboptimal living conditions are only used by a few species (Collinge 2000) and only over short distances (Haas 1995). Furthermore, the interactions between habitats depend on their sink or source qualities (Cornelsen et al. 1993; Irmler et al. 2000). In the present inquiries different borders between habitats were investigated: the transitional zone <b>between</b> terrestrial <b>ecosystems</b> and Lake Belau, the ecotones between the beech forest and the arable land, between the beech forests and the mixed forest on the slope, and between the littoral and pelagic of Lake Belau (cf. 1. 5). Research focused on the quantification of movements across the habitat boundaries for different groups of animals and the function of boundaries for the orientation of animals. The interaction processes between habitats and at habitat margins were additionally simulated by models to analyse ecotone effects on the animal populations. Furthermore, model simulations should help to predict the influence of a future landscape development on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|R
40|$|Lake Victoria is {{the largest}} {{tropical}} lake {{in the world with}} a surface area, 68, 800 km 2 (Bootsma and Hecky 1993). The lake is shared by three countries, with 51 % share in Tanzania, 43 % in Uganda, and 6 % in Kenya. Its land catchment area of 193, 000 km 2 is distributed as follows: Tanzania 44 %, Kenya 22 %, Uganda 16 %, Rwanda 11 %, and Burundi 7 %. The shoreline of the lake is approximately 3, 450 km, 50 % (1, 750 km) is in Uganda, 33 % (1, 150 km) is in Tanzania and 17 % (550 km) is in Kenya. The Lake Victoria is endowed with invaluable fishery resources that are contributing enormously to the livelihood of the communities and the riparian states in terms of food security, employment, wealth generation, foreign earnings and other multiplier effects. The lake (Tanzania side) accounts for over 60 % of the total national inland fish production. The lake is also an important source of water for domestic, industrial and small scale agriculture. It is also an important <b>transport</b> <b>corridor</b> <b>between</b> major towns around the lake and a number of villages, settlements, beaches and numerous islands. Steady population growth in the lake basin over the years resulted in deterioration of water quality and fisheries resources. Consequently Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) was started in 1997 as a five-year project with the main aim to rehabilitate the ecosystems in and around the lake with a long-term objective to introduce environmentally and socially sustainable economic development in the three riparian governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The volume of data and information generated by Fisheries Research and Fisheries Management components of LVEMP during the 8 years of implementation of Phase 1 of the LVEMP activities from July, 1997 to June 2002 and a bridging period of 3 years and half which extended the project from July 2002 to December 2005, promted the three riparian countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania together with GEF and the World Bank to consider conducting an exercise to analyze, consolidate and synthesize data and knowledge generated during the period.
