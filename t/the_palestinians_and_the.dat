25|$|At the Arab League {{summit of}} October 1947, in Aley, the Iraqi general, Ismail Safwat, painted a realist {{picture of the}} situation. He {{underlined}} the better organization and greater financial support of the Jewish people {{in comparison to the}} Palestinians. He recommended the immediate deployment of the Arab armies at the Palestinian borders, the dispatching of weapons and ammunition to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> contribution of a million pounds of financial aid to them. His proposals were rejected, other than the suggestion to send financial support, which was not followed up on. Nonetheless, a techno-military committee was established to coordinate assistance to the Palestinians. Based in Cairo, it was directed by Sawfat, who was supported by Lebanese and Syrian officers and representatives of the Higher Arab Committee. A Transjordian delegate was also appointed, but he did not participate in meetings.|$|E

2500|$|On Corrie's {{first night}} there, she {{and two other}} ISM members set up camp inside Block J, which the ISM {{described}} as [...] "a densely populated neighborhood along the Pink Line and frequent target of gunﬁre from an Israeli watchtower". By situating themselves visibly between <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Israeli snipers manning the watchtowers they hoped to discourage shooting by displaying banners stating that they were [...] "internationals". When Israeli soldiers fired warning shots, Corrie and her colleagues dismantled their tent and left the area.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 article {{entitled}} [...] "How Not {{to have a}} Palestinian State," [...] Toledo and his co-writers argued that Obama's call {{for a return to}} talks based on the pre-1967 boundaries is a [...] "clumsily concealed delegitimization device," [...] as Palestine does not meet the internal and external requirements to become a state. The only way forward, the argued, is not unilateral action by the UN General assembly but a bilateral agreement between <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Israelis, in which each party agrees to recognize the other as a legitimate state.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch foreign {{minister}} Maxime Verhagen said both Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority must investigate war crimes allegations, saying [...] "there {{can be no}} impunity for serious human rights violations both on <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Israeli side". Verhagen also urged Israel to halt building settlements in the West Bank, calling the practice a serious obstacle to peace, which [...] "will have to stop".|$|R

2500|$|In matters {{concerning}} {{relations with}} <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arab world, Peretz {{was seen as}} holding dovish positions. He {{was one of the}} early leaders of the Peace Now movement. He was also, in the 1980s, a member of a group of eight Labor party Knesset members, dubbed [...] "the Eight" [...] and led by Yossi Beilin, who tried to set a liberal agenda for the party in matters concerning the peace process with the Palestinians, connecting the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians with the failure to solve Israel's most pressing social ills.|$|E
2500|$|According to Masalha [...] "the {{defeat of}} the {{partition}} plan in no way diminished {{the determination of the}} Ben-Gurion camp ... to continue working for the removal of the native population." [...] In November 1937 a Population Transfer Committee was appointed to investigate the practicalities of transfer. It discussed details of the costs, specific places for relocation of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> order in which they should be transferred. In view of the need for land it concluded that the rural population should be transferred before the townspeople, and that a village by village manner would be best. In June 1938 Ben-Gurion summed up the mood in the JAE: [...] "I support compulsory transfer. I do not see anything immoral in it." [...] Regarding the unwillingness of the British to implement it, land expropriation was seen as a major mechanism to precipitate a Palestinian exodus. Also the remaining Palestinians should not be left with substantial landholdings.|$|E
2500|$|Slim quickly got on {{with the}} task of {{training}} his new army to take the fight to the enemy. His basic premise was that off-road mobility was paramount: much heavy equipment was exchanged for mule- or air-transported equipment, and motor transport was kept to a minimum and restricted to vehicles that could cope with some of the worst combat terrain on Earth. The new doctrine dictated that if the Japanese had cut the lines of communication, then they too were surrounded. All units were to form defensive 'boxes', to be resupplied by air and assisted by integrated close air support and armour. The boxes were designed as an effective response to the tactics of infiltration practised by the Japanese in the war. Slim also supported increased offensive patrolling and night training, to encourage his soldiers to lose both their fear of the jungle and their belief that Japanese soldiers were better jungle fighters. He also instructed them to hold their positions once outflanked. The Chin hills formed a natural defensive barrier into Burma, which Slim would have preferred to outflank by an amphibious operation by landing further down the coast of Burma, but demands of the war in Europe meant the necessary landing craft were not available, forcing Slim to devise plans for advancing into Burma the hard way through the Chin hills. At the same time, the Japanese 15th Army, which formed the main striking force of the Burma Area Army, had grown from four divisions at the beginning of 1943 to eight divisions by the end of 1943 as the Japanese made preparations for invading India, which increased the difficulties of an overland advance into Burma. By 1943, the Burma Death Railway which cost the lives of thousands of slaves who built it was finished, which allowed the Japanese to reinforce the Burma Area Army, and made invading India barely possible. As Slim went about training his men for the rigours of jungle warfare, he clashed with Brigadier Orde Wingate, who took away some of Slim's best Gurkha, British and African units for his Chindit raiding group. Slim argued against the loss of his better units to Wingate, and maintained that though Wingate had a successful career in Palestine and Ethiopia he would discover that the Japanese were a considerably tougher foe than <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Italians that Wingate had hitherto been fighting. However, Slim did approve of Wingate's plans for aid to the hill tribes of Burma. The various hill peoples of Burma such as the Kachins, Karens, Chin, Nagas and the Shan collectively amounted to about 7 million of Burma's 17 million people, and unlike the Barmars who had welcomed the Japanese as liberators, had stayed loyal to the British when the Japanese invaded. The hill peoples of Burma had suffered under Japanese rule, and were more than willing to wage guerrilla warfare against them. Slim approved of the plans of the SOE and OSS to provide arms and training to the hill tribes as a way to tie down Japanese forces that would otherwise be deployed against him.|$|E

25|$|The {{approach}} of the State of Israel and of Israeli-Jews to {{the causes of the}} exodus are divided into two main periods: 1949-late 1970s, late 1970s-nowadays.
