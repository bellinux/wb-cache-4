Some bad men, including a sharper named Sid Merrick, were responsible for the theft of some freight from the local railroad, and Merrick, by a slick trick, obtained possession of some <b>traction</b> company <b>bonds</b> belonging to Randolph Rover. The Rover boys managed to locate the freight thieves, but Sid Merrick got away from them, dropping a pocketbook containing the <b>traction</b> company <b>bonds</b> in his flight. This was at a time when Dick, Tom and Sam had returned to Putnam Hall for their final term at that institution. At the Hall they had made a bitter enemy of a big, stocky bully named Tad Sobber and of another lad named Nick Pell. Tad Sobber, to get even with the Rovers for a fancied injury, sent to the latter a box containing a live, poisonous snake. The snake got away and hid in Nick Pell's desk and Nick was bitten and for some time it was feared that he might die. He exposed Tad Sobber, and fearing arrest the bully ran away from the Hall. Later, much to their surprise, the Rover boys learned that the bully was a ward and nephew of Sid Merrick, and when the sharper disappeared, Tad Sobber went with him.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of an Er:YAG laser (2960 nm) to prepare class V cavities as compared with rotary instruments. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six freshly extracted human molars were selected and randomly distributed in two groups. Non standardized class V cavities were prepared using (group 1) a diamond bur for enamel, plus a tungsten bur for dentin with water irrigation and (group 2) an Er:YAG laser (output parameters, enamel: 1000 mJ, 12 Hz, dentin: 500 mJ, 20 Hz) with a continuous flow of water. Results: The SEM examination revealed characteristic micro-irregularities of the lased samples as compared with the conventional prepared cavities: group 1, the walls of the cavities were slightly curved and a smear layer plus muds covered peripheric walls as well as the depth of the cavity; rare dentinal tubules were opened; linear and circular surface irregularities were observed on the dentin; and group 2, the walls of the cavities were irregular, jagged; photo-ablation creates a real cleavage of hydroxyapatite prisms with respect to the enamel prism pathway; an homogeneous dentin with opened dentinal tubules covered the depth of the cavities; intertubular dentin is selectively more ablated than Er-YAG the peritubular dentin. Conclusions: Jagged outline as well as opened dentinal tubules are the main characteristics of the Er-YAG prepared class V cavities. Further investigations (ulstrastructural, histochemical properties of the lased dentin, resistance to <b>traction</b> of <b>bonded</b> resins) should be conducted.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the plane {{external}} crack in an unbounded elastic solid was recently reconsidered by Stallybrass 111. In this paper, Stallybrass showed that existing solutions imply the presence of loads remote from the crack tips and he attempted to reduce these loads to zero by superposition of classical solutions. In other words, the total force R " and the total moment Mm on the crack plane (including the applied loads) were required to vanish. It {{is the purpose of}} this letter to show that it is not always possible to prescribe arbitrarily Rm and M " and still maintain that the crack remains completely open.

40|$|This study evaluates tensile bond {{strength}} (TBS) of metal orthodontic attachments to sandblasted feldspathic porcelain and zirconia with various bonding protocols. Thirty-six (36) feldspathic and 36 zirconia disc samples were prepared, glazed, embedded in acrylic blocks and sandblasted, and {{divided into three}} groups according {{to one or more}} of the following treatments: hydrofluoric acid 4 % (HF), Porcelain Conditioner silane primer, Reliance Assure® primer, Reliance Assure plus® primer, and Z Prime™ plus zirconia primer. A round <b>traction</b> hook was <b>bonded</b> to each sample. Static tensile {{bond strength}} tests were performed in a universal testing machine and adhesive remnant index (ARI) scoring was done using a digital camera. One-way ANOVA and Pearson chi-square tests were used to analyze TBS (MPa) and ARI scores. No statistically significant mean differences were found in TBS among the different bonding protocols for feldspathic and zirconia, p values = 0. 369 and 0. 944, respectively. No statistically significant distribution of ARI scores was found among the levels of feldspathic, p value = 0. 569. However, statistically significant distribution of ARI scores was found among the levels of zirconia, p value = 0. 026.

Method: For this experiment twenty temporary molar teeth were used from the Human Teeth Bank in the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Sao Paulo. All teeth were cut in the mesion-distal direction and included in light-cured acrylic resin with its vestibular, palatal and lingual faces directed toward the external surface. The teeth had its vestibular and lingual faces worn till the areas were all flat and randomly divided into four groups. G 1 : Prime & Bond NT (Dentsply Caulk); G 2 : Optbond Solo (Kerr); G 3 : Excite (Vivadent) and G 4 : Single Bond (3 M). The adhesive systems were applied according to the manufactures instructions. The same restorative material (Filtek Z- 250 3 M) was used in all groups. The samples were conserved in distilled during 24 h and then submerged in traction assay. Results: Groups 2 and 3 brings the lowest notes and groups 1 and 4 the highest notes.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the thesis is {{interfacial}} crack problems in anisotropic and piezoelectric bimaterials. We seek to solve a variety of problems using weight function techniques and singular integral equations. We begin by studying a dynamic crack along a perfectly bonded interface in an anisotropic bimaterial. Using a weight function de- rived from a mirrored problem {{it is possible to}} derive important ma- terial parameters which govern the crack propagation. Following this a static crack is considered. However, in this case the materials are not bonded perfectly, an imperfect interface is present instead. A method is derived where singular integral equations for the imperfect interface problem are derived through use of perfect interface weight functions. The weight functions are then extended to fracture in piezoelectric bimaterials which allows equivalent integral equations to be derived relating the mechanical and electrical elds. In past literature a num- ber of results have been found which can only be used when consider- ing a symmetric load system on the crack faces. All of the problems considered here have asymmetric loading. Firstly, a steady-state formulation is used to derive asymptotic coe cients of the crack displacement and interfacial tractions for a dynamic crack along a perfect interface. The method can be used to nd many asymptotic coe cients but the one of most importance here is the stress intensity factor which therefore enables the calculation of energy release rate at the crack tip. As an example an orthotropic bimaterial with two di erent loading con gurations is used to examine the importance of crack speed and load asymmetry on the properties of the crack propagation. iv We proceed to study imperfect interface conditions for an anisotropic bimaterial. Usually when looking at such a problem it is necessary to derive new weight functions which correspond to the imperfect inter- face. An innovative method which makes use of the Betti formula and existing weight functions for the analogous perfect interface problem is derived. This procedure is used to obtain singular integral equations which relate the crack loading, which is assumed to be known, to the displacement jump over both the crack and interface and <b>tractions</b> along the <b>bonded</b> area between the materials. Examples of the results obtained through solving the integral equations numerically are given. Finally, we extend the weight functions used previously in the the- sis to a piezoelectric setting. The general form of the weight function for any piezoelectric bimaterial is given before two speci c examples are studied in depth. The examples are chosen in such a way to illus- trate the e ect that the poling direction of the bimaterial can have on both the mechanical and electrical elds. For both examples explicit expressions are derived for the weight functions which are then used to derive singular integral equations which can be used to study the e ect of both mechanical loading and electrical charges being applied to the crack faces. To nish we present some examples for both poling directions to illustrate the use of the derived equations. INTERCER...|$|R
