5|$|Segrè was {{appointed}} {{assistant professor of}} physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. In 1934, he met Elfriede Spiro, a Jewish woman whose family had come from Ostrowo in West Prussia, but had fled to Breslau when that part of Prussia became part of Poland after World War I. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, she had emigrated to Italy, where she worked as a secretary and an interpreter. At first she did not speak Italian well, and Segrè and Spiro conversed in German, in which he was fluent. The two were married at the Great Synagogue of Rome on 2 February 1936. He agreed with the rabbi to spend the minimal amount on the wedding, giving the balance of what would be spent on a luxury wedding to Jewish refugees from Germany. The rabbi managed to give them many of the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> luxury wedding anyway. The couple had three children: Claudio, born in 1937, Amelia Gertrude Allegra, born in 1937, and Fausta Irene, born in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{personal}} {{union of the}} crowns Carlisle Castle should have become obsolete as a frontier fortress, but the two kingdoms continued as separate states. In 1639, with war between the two kingdoms looming, the castle was refortified using stone from the cathedral cloisters. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the castle was garrisoned for the king. It endured a long siege from October 1644 until June 1645 when the Royalist forces surrendered after the Battle of Naseby. The city was occupied by a parliamentary garrison, and subsequently by their Scots allies. In 1646, the Scots, now holding Carlisle pending payment of monies owed them by the English Parliament, improved its fortifications, destroying the cathedral's nave to obtain the stone to rebuild the castle. Carlisle continued to remain a barracks thereafter. In 1698 travel writer Celia Fiennes wrote of Carlisle as having most of the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military town and was rife with alcohol and prostitutes.|$|E

500|$|Æthelstan's {{court was}} {{the centre of}} {{a revival of the}} {{elaborate}} hermeneutic style of later Latin writers, influenced by the West Saxon scholar Aldhelm (c.639–709), and by early tenth-century French monasticism. Foreign scholars at Æthelstan's court such as Israel the Grammarian were practitioners. The style was characterised by long, convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms. The [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] charters were written in hermeneutic Latin. In the view of Simon Keynes {{it is no coincidence that}} they first appear immediately after the king had for the first time united England under his rule, and they show a high level of intellectual attainment and a monarchy invigorated by success and adopting the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new political order. The style influenced architects of the late tenth-century monastic reformers educated at Æthelstan's court such as Æthelwold and Dunstan, and became a hallmark of the movement. After [...] "Æthelstan A", charters became more simple, but the hermeneutic style returned in the charters of Eadwig and Edgar.|$|E

Emperor Jianwen ruled only for one year, dying in 372. He did not create her any special titles, but he did create her son Sima Yao crown prince. Sima Yao, after Emperor Jianwen's death, ascended the throne as Emperor Xiaowu. Initially, {{out of respect for}} his father's deceased wife Princess Wang, he did not honor Consort Li as empress dowager, but did progressively honor her with greater and greater imperial consort titles. In 387, he honored her as Consort Dowager (皇太妃), with all ceremonial <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> empress dowager. In 394, after a petition by Sima Daozi (by now the Prince of Kuaiji), she was finally honored as empress dowager.|$|R

500|$|The first charter {{produced}} by [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] in 928 described the king as rex Anglorum, [...] "king of the English", {{the first time}} that title had been used. By 931 he had become [...] "king of the English, elevated by the right hand of the Almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain". Some charters were witnessed by Welsh kings, and occasionally by the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde, signifying acceptance of Æthelstan's lordship. In Keynes's view, it cannot be a coincidence that the charters commenced immediately after the conquest of Northumbria, and [...] "Æthelstan A"'s primary aim was to display the [...] "grandeur of Æthelstan's kingship". Foot argues that the king's inner circle quickly seized on the potential of the conquest for [...] "ideological aggrandizement of the king's public standing". To Keynes, the diplomas [...] "are symbolic of a monarchy invigorated by success, developing the pretensions commensurate with its actual achievements and clothing itself in the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new political order."

500|$|The {{tour was}} also notable for {{giving rise to}} the term [...] "new Madonna", a {{stronger}} and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe.

I got more sense of the strength and power that was under her image all along." [...] Another important fact noted in the tour by scholars is the extensive use of multimedia technique to its maximum potential. Says Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, that [...] "Madonna transformed the concept of a concert tour being focused on the songs. She turned her Who's That Girl? tour into a ubiquitous multimedia blitz technique by including songs, dancing, choreography, videos, big screens, backdrops—not to mention the subtle preaching and messages—that made singing a secondary quality for concert goers. Evident from the people that thronged to see the tour, they were there for the spectacle—and not see Madonna {{standing in front of the}} microphone and singing.|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{judicial}} system of ancient Macedonia except that the king acted as the chief judge of the kingdom. The Macedonian kings were also supreme commanders of the military, with early evidence including not only Alexander I's role in the Greco-Persian Wars but also with the city-state of Potidaea accepting Perdiccas II of Macedon as their commander during their rebellion against the Delian League of Athens in 432 BC. In addition to the esteem won by serving as Macedonia's supreme commander, Philip II was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as the high priest of the nation. He performed daily ritual sacrifices and led religious festivals. Alexander imitated various aspects of his father's reign, such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers.

40|$|This Article {{proposes to}} {{modernize}} the archaic procedures states use to authorize marriages so as to provide legal flexibility, promote efficiency, and enhance individual choice. Almost universally, states require couples 2 ̆ 7 presence within their borders, however briefly, for a ceremony. After considering the historical and policy rationales for this requirement and finding them either obsolete or incoherent, we propose that states offer marriages to those outside their borders. Such distance marriages could occur via video-conference, using the internet or even telephone, with readily available safeguards to prevent fraud. This simple reform would allow certain couples who cannot marry under local law to import the <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official marriage ceremony in 2 ̆ 2 real time, 2 ̆ 2 as well as assure access to the legal tie for any couple facing <b>a</b> barrier <b>of</b> physical separation. Our proposal builds upon the historical and present-day precedent of proxy marriage and legal principles such as choice of law for multi-jurisdictional contracts and corporate formation. With this reform, states {{would be free to}} compete over marriage procedure efficiency and experiment with alternative regulatory goals or menu options, such as enabling greater disclosure about personal or health histories, permitting more restrictive prenuptial arrangements (as with certain states 2 ̆ 7 development of 2 ̆ 2 covenant marriage 2 ̆ 2) or tying access to certain distance marriages to advance agreement to accept jurisdiction for marriage dissolution. Finally, our proposal would allow same-sex couples (and other couples unable to marry under their home jurisdictions 2 ̆ 7 laws) easier access to marriage authorization and the ability to perform wedding ceremonies before family and friends.
