5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> {{of the people of the}} land, including him.

5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed obesity {{as the result}} of a character flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E

6000|$|Object. But, {{some may}} say, the slighting or rejecting of the Son of Man, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Mary, cannot be <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> that is unpardonable, as {{is clear from}} that Scripture in Matthew 12:32, where He Himself saith, [...] "Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither {{in the world to}} come." [...] Now by this it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> that is unpardonable is one thing, and <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> against <b>the</b> Son of Man another; that sin that is against the Son of Man is pardonable; but if that was <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> against <b>the</b> Holy Ghost, it would not be pardonable; {{therefore}} <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> against <b>the</b> Son of Man is not <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> against <b>the</b> Holy Ghost, <b>the</b> unpardonable <b>sin.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Amazing Jeckel Brothers is {{the fifth}} studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, {{released}} on May 25, 1999, by Island Records, in association with Psychopathic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1998 to 1999. The album {{is the fifth}} Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics focus on the 9 circles of hell, and the morality of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil. The album's titular Jeckel Brothers are spirits who juggle balls of fire, representing <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> committed during the mortal life of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|The shrine at Bury St Edmunds {{soon became}} one of the most famous and wealthy pilgrimage {{locations}} in England. In 1010, Edmund's remains were translated to London to protect them from the Vikings, where they were kept for three years before being returned to Bury. For centuries the shrine was visited by various kings of England, many of whom gave generously to the abbey: Sweyn's son, King Canute, converted to Christianity and rebuilt the abbey at Bury St Edmunds. In 1020, he made a pilgrimage and offered his own crown upon the shrine as atonement for <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> of his forefathers.|$|E

5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice for <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> {{of the world to}} the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees {{at the far end}} of the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade are believed to be imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that people who commit sins go to Hell {{and have to go}} through punishments in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> they committed. The god Yamarāja, who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> committed by an individual are kept by Chitragupta, who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of karma. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to svarga, a temporary realm of enjoyment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.|$|E
