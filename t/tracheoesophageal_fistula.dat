5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (<b>tracheoesophageal</b> <b>fistula).</b> Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Although, SHH is most {{commonly}} associated with brain and limb digit development, it is also seen {{to be an important}} player in lung development. Studies using qPCR and knockouts have demonstrated that SHH contributes to embryonic lung development. The mammalian lung branching occurs in the epithelium of the developing bronchi and lungs. SHH expressed throughout the foregut endoderm (innermost of three germ layers) in the distal epithelium where the embryonic lungs are developing. This suggests that SHH is partially responsible for the branching of the lungs. Further evidence of SHH’s role in lung branching has been seen with qPCR. SHH expression occurs in the developing lungs around embryonic day 11 and is strongly expressed in the buds of the fetal lungs but low in the developing bronchi. Mice who are deficient in SHH can develop <b>tracheoesophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> (abnormal connection of the esophagus and trachea). Additionally, it a double (SHH-/- [...] ) knockout mouse model exhibited poor lung development. The lungs of the SHH double knockout failed to undergo lobation and branching (the abnormal lungs only developed one branch compared to an extensively branched phenotype of the wildtype).|$|E

We switched from right to left thoracoscopy after finding an RAA. A proximal oesophageal pouch was hemmed into the vascular ring; therefore, we selected a two-stage repair. The TEF was resected and simple internal traction was placed into the oesophagus at the first stage. Detailed examination showed the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) completing a vascular ring. The subsequent primary oesophago-oesophagostomy and dissection of PDA was performed by left-sided thoracoscope.

30|$|Tracheo/bronchoesophageal fistula may be congenital, traumatic, inflammatory, or neoplastic. Most {{patients}} with congenital <b>tracheoesophageal</b> <b>fistulas</b> (TEF) are diagnosed immediately following birth or during infancy, because more than 98  % {{are associated with}} atresia of the esophagus [1]. Congenital TEF without esophagus atresia H type TEF is rare but reportedly detected in adults because of long-standing respiratory symptoms [1 – 7]. The distribution of this disease is equal between males and females. It is three times more common on the right than the left and is seen more in the right lower lobe [6, 7]. According to the classification of Braimbridge and Keith [7], type I is a fistula associated with a wide-necked congenital diverticulum of the esophagus with inflammation at the tip. Type II, {{which is the most}} common, consists of a short tract running directly from the esophagus to the lobar or segmental bronchi. In type III, the fistulous tract connects the esophagus to a cystic pulmonary change. In type IV, a fistula runs into a sequestered pulmonary segment. The patient described here may come under the definition of type IV because the existence of sequestered lung was suspected on the ground of an abnormal artery from an abdominal artery running into the right lower lung lobe, and a septum was clearly detected in the lobe by microscope.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: complex {{esophagus}} {{represents a}} final condition that occurs secondary to diseases that require multiple procedures or esophageal replacement surgery, either {{because it is}} the only treatment or because others interventions have failed. Our objective is to describe the results of esophageal reconstruction surgery in patients with complex esophageal pathology attended in two high-level hospitals in Medellin, Colombia, between January 1 - 2006 and June 31 - 2016. Methods: descriptive and retrospective study with review of clinical records at Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe (HPTU) and Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación (HSVF), collecting 40 patients. Results: the most frequent diagnosis was esophageal atresia, followed by esophageal burn. The main causes that led these patients to be classified as complex esophagus were persistent esophageal strictures, recurrent <b>tracheoesophageal</b> <b>fistulas,</b> esophageal fistulas and the long gap. The surgical interventions were in order of frequency: gastric replacement, closure of the fistula, colon replacement, esophagostomy and gastrostomy, resection and anastomosis and esophagoplasty. The main postoperative complications of patients undergoing esophageal reinterventions or esophageal replacement were stenosis, fistulas, surgical site infection and functional disorders. Conclusions: children with complex esophageal pathology represent a challenge for pediatric surgeons, because of the difficulty of the procedures they undergo as well as the morbidity of their diseases and surgeries they require to give continuity to their digestive tract...|$|R
40|$|Background: Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) are a well-accepted {{treatment}} modality for malignant tracheobronchial obstruction or malignant <b>tracheoesophageal</b> <b>fistulae</b> (TEFs). The traditional approach to SEMS insertion in central airway obstruction (CAO) has been rigid bronchoscopy performed under general anesthesia. Fluoroscopic guidance is sometimes utilized. Safe and accurate placement of tracheobronchial SEMS {{has also been}} described using flexible bronchoscopy. We herein describe our experience with tracheal SEMS insertion using flexible bronchoscopy without fluoroscopic guidance. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the bronchoscopy records was undertaken for the duration June 2012 to June 2014. Patients with malignant CAO or malignant TEF who underwent tracheal SEMS insertion using flexible bronchoscopy were included. Procedures were performed under mild sedation. Fluoroscopic guidance was not utilized. Results: Eleven patients were identified. The mean age was 60. 9 (12. 8) years. There were 6 males and 5 female patients. Most common indication for tracheal SEMS was CAO (9 / 11) followed by TEF (2 / 11). Stent deployment could be accomplished successfully and at the desired location in all the patients. All patients reported immediate symptomatic relief. Two patients experienced peri-procedural respiratory failure that recovered within 24 h. There was no procedure related mortality or other major complications. Conclusion: Insertion of tracheal SEMS in patients with malignant CAO/TEF using flexible bronchoscopy under minimal sedation is a safe and efficacious modality that can be performed without fluoroscopic guidance...|$|R
