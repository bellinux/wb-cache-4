40|$|The {{use of an}} {{ultrasound}} technique, developed at the Institute of Textiles & Clothing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, offers numerous advantages during wet processing of textiles. The ultrasonic technique {{has been applied to}} different areas of wet processing including desizing, scouring and bleaching, washing and in dyeing, and finishing. The application of ultrasonics in the size box and steaming on the affinity of the sizing agent for cotton, polyester, and their blend warp yarns, gives a considerable potential for enhancing the affinity of the size for fibers. The use of degraded starch followed by ultrasonic desizing could lead to considerable energy savings as compared to conventional starch sizing and desizing. Scouring of wool with the ultrasonic technique in neutral or very light alkaline baths reduces fiber damage and enhances the rate of processing. The use of ultrasound in reactive dyeing of cellulosic fabrics can result in energy savings, less water consumption, increased depth of color, and better process conditions.

40|$|In nylon {{finishing}} a final step is a thermal treatment to fix auxiliary chemicals to fibers, to remove volatile compounds and monomers and to relax the textile structure. For this purpose stenters with natural gas burners are applied. The hot exhaust air contains monomers, solvents, lubricants and specific <b>textile</b> <b>auxiliary</b> chemicals {{that have to}} be removed with large amounts of fresh or process water by exhaust air washers. To reduce water costs, process-integrated water treatment and recycling processes are demanded. Annular photoreactors with low and middle-pressure mercury arc lamps and a solar non concentrating tubular receiver reactor have been applied to examine the treatment of exhaust air washer liquor and its components in the laboratory and up to semi-technical scale. The application of sole UV radiation, the combination of UV radiation with oxidants, semiconductor photocatalysts and the light enhanced Fenton reaction were compared. The photo Fenton conditions were optimized in respect of throughput and hydrogen peroxide consumption. The degradation pathway of epsilon-caprolactam (the main constituent of the air washer liquor) was analyzed by ion chromatography and HPLC-MS. The overall degradation was controlled by total organic carbon analysis. Intermediates like epsilon-amino capronic acid, N-hydroxy-epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-nitroso capronic acid have been confirmed as initial intermediates also like acetate, oxalate and formiate as intermediates before complete mineralization. In comparison to photolytic hydrogen peroxide oxidation, light enhanced Fenton turned out to be much faster and to consume lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It could be demonstrated that the iron catalyst can be recycled with minor activity losses with middle-pressure mercury arc lamps. Photochemically enhanced Fenton reaction has proved to be most effective with respect to the consumption of time, energy and chemicals for the application in exhaust air treatment of nylon finishing. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Textile wastewaters from dyeing and {{finishing}} processes are heavily polluted with dyes, <b>textile</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> and chemicals {{and have a}} broad range of pH, high COD concentration and suspended particles. In this study, the efficiency of color and turbidity removal from synthetic textile wastewater samples were investigated by combined process of coagulation/ flocculation and electron beam irradiation. Materials and Methods: The experiments have been done on model dye solution samples which prepared from ten dyes that are supplied from Yazd Baff textile factory. Aluminum sulphate was employed to determine the optimum conditions for removal of turbidity by jar-test experiments. Then samples were irradiated by 10 MeV electron beam of Rhodotron TT 200 accelerator at different doses of 1, 3 and 6 kGy. Absorption spectra of the samples were measured using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 25). The pH and turbidity values of the solutions were measured by a Metrohm 827 model pH meter and 2100 AN turbidimeter (Hach company). Results: According to results, the degree of decoloration and turbidity removal of synthetic dye solutions increased dramatically when the alum concentration increased and reached to 64 % and 90 % respectively at 112 ppm. After irradiation, it is observed that absorbance at 540 nm decreased rapidly by increasing of radiation dose, because of macromolecules degradation and then decreased slowly and degree of decoloration reached to 95 %. The amount of pH was decreased by irradiation and then changed very slowly or remained constant with increasing irradiation dose. Conclusion: The above results indicate that combination of coagulation/ flocculation and irradiation of 10 MeV electron beam is so effective for turbidity removal and decoloration. Coagulation process eliminates suspended particles from disperse dyes effectively, while destruction of soluble dye molecules happen by irradiation that increase decoloration efficiency considerably...|$|R

As a result of bioaccumulation in the food chain and groundwater contamination, they pose public health problems because {{many of them are}} toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. Although synthetic chemicals are usually recalcitrant to biodegradation, microorganisms have evolved an extensive range of enzymes, pathways, and control mechanisms that are responsible for catabolism {{of a wide variety of}} such compounds.

The pathways by which a given compound is degraded are determined by the physical, chemical, and microbiological aspects of a particular environment. By understanding the genetic basis of catabolism of xenobiotics, it is possible to improve the efficacy of naturally occurring microorganisms or construct new microorganisms capable of degrading pollutants in soil and aquatic environments more efficiently. Recently a number of genes whose enzyme products have a broader substrate specificity for the degradation of aromatic compounds have been cloned and attempts have been made to construct gene cassettes or synthetic operons comprising these degradative genes.

The oil has high medicinal value, due to presence of anti-oxidants, anti-cancer agents, cholesterol reducing agents, skin improving agents, antidandruff and anti-itching agents. The oil can also be used for production of soap, surfactants, cosmetic formulations, emulsifiers, <b>textile</b> <b>auxiliaries,</b> synthetic rubber products etc. In this work, extraction of rice bran oil from various brands of rice bran available in Sri Lanka has been studied. Experiments were conducted using pilot plant scale leaching unit and the soxhlet apparatus to extract rice bran oil using hexane as the solvent. The key factors controlling the extraction have been identified. Results show that the bran obtained from parboiled paddy has a higher yield of rice bran oil compared to the raw rice bran. Method of bran pretreatment, extraction temperature, extraction time, pellet size and free fatty acid content are the factors affecting oil extraction. Comparison of extraction results by various pretreatment methods shows an enhancement of oil extractability due to steaming. Analysis of the extracted oil shows that steaming is the most effective method of bran pre-treatment with respect to the FFA content. Pelletization of bran provides easy percolation and avoids channeling of the solvent and contamination of the oil from fine solids. Results show a decrease in extraction rate with time and {{this may be due to}} the fact that the solute has to diffuse from the interior of the pellet in the later stages of extraction. Extraction of rice bran oil using organic solvents was compared with aqueous extraction. The highest yield for aqueous extraction was obtained at 70 °C and pH 12. Refined and raw rice bran oil and commonly used vegetable oils were analyzed and the results were compared. Tie line and mass transfer data necessary for batch and continuous leaching equipment design were determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} the application of ecological risk assessment for Pollution Prevention (P 2). Thirteen <b>textile</b> industry <b>auxiliary</b> products were selected by their Material Safety Data Sheets – MSDS. The exposure and environmental behavior of substances were estimated by the softwares E-FAST and EPIWin, respectively, considering the following properties: bio-concentration potential (Kow and Bioconcentration Factor), soil absorption potential (Koc), biodegradability, and removal percentage after effluent treatment. The hazards to aquatic biota identified were the acute and chronic toxic effects to algae, aquatic invertebrates and fish, estimated through Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), using the ECOSAR software. The ecological risk was determined considering the hazards and exposure of each substance, and demonstrated that three wetting agents and one dispersant have ecological risks in sufficient degree to justify their exclusion. The products evaluated presented low potentials for biota distribution (low Kow and bio-accumulation factor) and soil absorption (low Koc). The study demonstrates that ecological risk assessment is a low-cost, fast, and relatively reliable method for selecting products with lower pollution potentials that can be used by any industrial sector...|$|R
40|$|Textile dyes are {{molecules}} {{designed to}} impart a permanent colour to textile fabrics. They pose an environmental problem {{because they are}} toxic and they decrease the aesthetic value of rivers and lakes. Current technologies for dye removal cannot remove all classes of dyes and two or more technologies are usually combined to achieve statisfactory decolouriza-tion efficiencies. Lignin-degrading enzymes like laccases are potential technologies for dye decolourization and decolourization with immobilized laccase has been intensively in-vestigated. The majority of those studies however have focused on dye disappearance and several reported that significant dye adsorption had occured during the dye removal, mak-ing {{the role of the}} enzyme unclear. Moreover, <b>textile</b> wastewaters contain <b>auxiliary</b> chem-icals that can impact enzymatic dye decolourization and very few studies have evaluated the impact of those substances on laccase. This research evaluated the feasibility of treat-ing dye-contaminated textile wastewaters with an immobilized laccase system. The first sub-objective was to examined the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 (an anthraquinone dye) by Trametes versicolor laccase immobilized on controlled porosity carrier (CPC) sil...|$|R
