Trading assets are segregated from the investment portfolio.

40|$|In {{the debate}} about United States {{subsidies}} of private sector R&D, it is sometimes argued {{that the state of}} our technology is closely related to our current account deficits, particularly in what has been called the Advanced Technology Products (ATP) <b>trade</b> <b>account.</b> The corollary is that taking appropriate actions to increase research and development activities will both improve our technology and reduce the size of the ATP <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit. The paper exams this proposition in a two-country two-firm intra-industry trade model, where firms play a two-stage quality-quantity game. The primary result of the paper is that if, as compared to its trading partners, the United States has about the same demand function but higher production costs then increases in R&D are likely to reduce an ATP <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit. If, on the other hand, both costs and the value customers place on the product are high in the United States as compared to its trading partners, then increases in R&D are likely to increase the size of the ATP <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{short-term}} causal relationship between unemployment and the volume of trade deficit in jordan for the period 2000 : 01 – 2012 : 02. This study provides evidence of the absence of a long-term relationship between the two variables. We use granger causality test and propose an augmented dickey-fuller (adf) coefficient test for detecting the presence of a unit root in the model. The results show that <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit causes unemployment, and unemployment causes the <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit in the short run. This indicates that trade liberalization is also able to increase imports, decrease aggregate productivity in the differentiated sectors, and create inefficiency on economic performance. Thus, this would simultaneously decrease employment opportunities for jordan’s labour force. <b>Trade</b> <b>account</b> can also be an additional negative effect in increasing jordanian’s unemployment scenario in the future...|$|R
