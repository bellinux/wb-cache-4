The first references to trading that the “patriarch of the only dynasty of Portuguese bankers” was undertaking was in the purchase and sale of lotteries, along with national and international <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>loan</b> securities, on his own account. This took place in his Casa de Cambio, situated in centre of Lisbon and which dated back to {{the second half of}} the 19th century (1869). Since then and until 1920, he founded a number of banking institutions, such as Beirão, Silva Pinto & Cª., (1884-1887), Silva, Beirão, Pinto & Cª. (1897-1911), J. M. Espírito Santo Silva (1911-1915), and J. M. Espírito Santo Silva & Cª. (1915).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to critically analyze the banking system of Bangladesh with special aim of tracing out the major banking problems of the economy underneath and suggest remedies to solve the problems. In doing so the study revealed that huge loan-default, inadequacy of capital, higher transaction costs, lack of long-term financing and lack of close bank-firm relationship are the key problems of the banking sector of Bangladesh. Among these problems bank-firm relationship has been singled out as the key problem for discussion. Accordingly, it has been observed that bank-firm relationship in Bangladesh is mainly limited to financing aspects. The study concludes that, making bank-firm relationship closer can be beneficial for both the bank and the firm. It can work as remedy towards solving problems such as loan default; in-formation asymmetry and finally interest-spread problem for the banks. Also for the client firms, closer bank-firm relationship can reduce <b>transaction</b> costs, delay <b>in</b> <b>loan</b> decisions, and interest expense of bor-rowings. Finally, the study suggests that, by following Japanese ex-perience of <b>loan</b> syndication <b>in</b> the pattern of 'reciprocal delegated monitoring', supply of management resources and stockholding of firms by banks, can also become effective for the banking system of Ban-gladesh to promote close bank-firm relationship...|$|R

5000|$|Moriwaki {{began his}} career as a {{motorcycle}} racer for Hideo [...] "Pops" [...] Yoshimura, a respected motorcycle mechanic and tuner involved in Japanese motorcycle racing. Moriwaki received no formal training in engineering while working for Yoshimura. Instead, he became self-taught, learning about mechanical engineering from books borrowed from his local high school. Moriwaki married Namiko Yoshimura, Pops’ eldest daughter, while he was working for the company. In 1971, Yoshimura made the decision to move his company to the United States to take advantage of the burgeoning American motorcycle market. Moriwaki did not agree with Yoshimura and refused to leave his home in Japan. This created a rift between the two men however, within a year Yoshimura had returned to Japan and sought Moriwaki for help after he had been cheated out of all his money <b>in</b> a business <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> America. Moriwaki <b>loaned</b> Yoshimura money to re-establish himself. Yoshimura would go on to establish one of the premier manufacturers of motorcycle high performance parts in the United States and became closely associated with the Suzuki racing program.Moriwaki remained in Japan and became known for modifying engines and constructing frames for the Kawasaki Z1. His bikes were successfully raced in the Australian Superbike championships in the late 1970s by New Zealander Graeme Crosby. Crosby and co-rider Tony Hatton finished in third place at the prestigious Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race in 1978. Moriwaki's reputation continued to be enhanced when Crosby and Akitaka Tomie qualified a Moriwaki Kawasaki on pole position at the 1979 Suzuka 8 Hours, ahead of all the major factory racing teams. At the 1980 Suzuka 8 Hours race, the Moriwaki team of Dave Aldana and David Emde qualified in a respectable second place ahead of the official Kawasaki factory-backed team of Eddie Lawson and Gregg Hansford.|$|R
