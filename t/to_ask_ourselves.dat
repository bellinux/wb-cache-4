The expression [...] "And the Heat Goes On", used in the title and repeated in the chorus, {{is based on a}} New York Post headline Eno read in the summer of 1980 whilst Byrne rewrote the song title [...] "Don't Worry About the Government" [...] from TalkingHeads' debut album, , into the lyric [...] "Look {{at the hands of a}} government man". [...] The [...] "rhythmical rant" [...] in [...] "Crosseyed and Painless"—"Facts are simple and facts are straight.

[...] "Once in a Lifetime" [...] borrows heavily from preachers' diatribes. Some critics have suggested that the song is [...] "a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s". Byrne disagreed with the categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally; he stated, [...] "We're largely unconscious.

Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have worried about. It is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for us <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>ourselves,</b> arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the longer {{you look at them}} the thornier they get".|$|E
2500|$|Former Ambassador to Egypt [...] Frank Wisner said:"It wasn’t the {{military}} that plotted the seizure {{of the government and}} grabbed it. It was a massive public uprising that, left unchecked, would have produced great violence. It would have left {{the military}} in the miserable position of having to control those demonstrations by force. The cry from the crowd was they wanted new elections … to help decide the country's future, which has been so troubled. The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. We have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>ourselves,</b> then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. So we want to be very, very careful before we go out and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population. What is clear is the wave of anger against the government that drove Morsi from power, enjoyed massive, massive public support in the many, many millions of Egyptians.|$|E

40|$|In {{industrial}} organization analysis {{one of the}} most studied subject is product differentiation. In most cases it is considered an anticompetitive strategy carried out by dominant firms. In this work we tried <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> <b>ourselves</b> what is the real role played by this strategy in the market. To understand the real effects of product differentiation we removed some basic assumptions from the principal model elaborated in the economic literature. Particularly, we introduced the multi-dimensions characteristics space. The description of an n-dimensions characteristics space allowed us to introduce the powerful max-min principle, which states that firms use maximum differentiation along the nth characteristic and minimum differentiation along the n- 1 characteristics. The max-min principle open the door to a long waited conciliation in economic theory on product differentiation. Indeed, on one hand some old models found that firms are led by the agglomeration effect; they locate their products close to the ones produced by other firms with the plan to gain bigger market share. In other words, firms choose minimum differentiation. On the other hand, some scholars shown how firms are dominated by the strategic effect. They decide to locate their products as far as possible from the ones sold by their competitors, with the intend to exploit market power. Through the max-min principle the agglomeration and the strategic effect can live together. Firms choose the strategic effect in the nth characteristic and the agglomeration effect in the n- 1 characteristics. Finally, trough games theory tools, specially with folk theorems we described how newcomers can enter the market in horizontally differentiated markets. We interpreted the entry process as an infinitely repeated game, where at each stage there could be a new entrant who wants to sell their products. This intuition is coherent with the market structure, where incumbent gains extra profits due to product differentiation. Therefore, newcomers are attracted by these additional earnings, and desire to enter the market. Form this viewpoint the incumbent is playing an infinite entry game, every time with a different competitor. Horizontal Product Differentiation, entry barriers, competition...|$|R

60|$|Burke, a fine rhetorician, {{who rarely}} faced realities, said, I think, that an Englishman's house is his castle. This is {{honestly}} entertaining; for {{as it happens}} the Englishman is almost {{the only man in}} Europe whose house is not his castle. Nearly everywhere else exists the assumption of peasant proprietorship; that a poor man may be a landlord, though he is only lord of his own land. Making the landlord and the tenant the same person has certain trivial advantages, as that the tenant pays no rent, while the landlord does a little work. But I am not concerned with the defense of small proprietorship, but merely with the fact that it exists almost everywhere except in England.
