50|$|A TRQ {{combines}} two {{policy instruments}} that nations historically {{have used to}} restrict imports: quotas and tariffs. In a TRQ, the quota component works together with a specified tariff level to provide the desired degree of import protection. Essentially, a TRQ is a two-tiered tariff. The first Q imports entering within the quota portion of a TRQ are usually subject to a lower, tariff rate called the Inside <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> rate or ITQR. Imports above the quota's quantitative threshold (Q) face a much higher (usually prohibitive) Outside <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> rate or OTQR. The Q units are called the quota volume, and this volume serves as the cut off between the ITQR and the OTQR.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at generalizing the results of {{establishing}} the free trade zone between Ukraine and the EU in 2016, and developing measures to improve the system of non-tariff regulation of foreign trade activities. The substance, objectives, and tools of the non-tariff regulation of foreign trade activity, as used in the EU and in Ukraine, were considered. The major {{attention was paid to}} the <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> for Ukraine in the terms of the free-trade zone with the European Union. The <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> for different goods were analyzed from the view of their adequacy and uniformity of use. Reasons for partial use or non-use of the <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> were identified. Issues of effectiveness of implementation of the restrictive function of <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas,</b> as well as their influence on Ukrainian exporters, were considered. A comparative characterization of the <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas,</b> which were applied within the terms of the free trade zone for Ukraine and for the EU, was carried out. The article specifies the necessity for compliance by Ukraine with technical reglaments, environmental regulations, sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, marketing standards.

40|$|In the {{negotiations}} on {{agriculture in the}} World Trade Organization, it was asserted that an importing state trading enterprise affects the domestic market but not the international market. This claim is investigated through specifying a model of intermediaries in international trade. There {{are two kinds of}} intermediaries: first, a state trading enterprise; and second, an n-firm Cournot oligopsony/oligopoly that acts as the counterfactual. Using Japanese market price and quantity data for rice, and elasticity parameters drawn from the literature, the equations of the model are calibrated to these data and parameters. The resulting equations then permit the calculation of the tariff equivalence of the state trading enterprise under different assumptions about market structure, as well as the welfare effects associated with them. The equations are re-specified to model the existing import regime for rice, which is a <b>tariff</b> <b>quota.</b> The conclusions are: first, that, compared with the counterfactual, an importing state trading enterprise acts like a tariff by restricting imports; and second, the current import regime of a <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> causes a welfare loss compared with the counterfactual...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that spatial {{equilibrium}} model is used as an efficient analytical tool of international trade. But {{it is very difficult to}} take specific duties and ad valorem duties into consideration when we try to apply the spatial equilibrium model to analyze the real international trade under complex <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> system.

In this paper, based on the concept of shadow prices and Linear Complementarity Problem, we show how to take specific duties and ad valorem duties into consideration when we try to apply the model, and present a spatial equilibrium model of international trade, which can be used as an efficient and general analytical tool of oligopolistic international trade of some type under real traiff quota system with specific duties and ad valorem duties.

40|$|Recent {{rounds of}} GATT and later WTO have {{advocated}} widespread tariffication, meaning that existing non-tariff barriers {{be converted into}} import equivalent tariffs. From an economic point of view, the effects of such tariffication are not entirely clear. The paper presents a general equilibrium model with monopolistic competition to examine the welfare effects of tariffication. The ranking of pre- and post-tariffication welfare depends crucially {{on the nature of}} the initial trade barrier and the tariff tool applied. Tariffication using a specific (an ad valorem) tariff results in the same (a reduced) welfare level compared to an initial quota, whereas welfare is increased (the same) compared to an initial VER.

40|$|Contact {{for this}} paper: Dr. Karl Meilke, Department of Agricultural Economics and Business, Guelph, Ontario N 1 G 2 W 1, Canada. The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture.

However, in the dairy sector, the border measure most commonly adopted by developed countries was a system of <b>tariff</b> rate <b>quotas.</b> <b>Tariff</b> rate <b>quotas</b> are two-tiered <b>tariffs</b> which allow a small quantity of the product to be imported at a low or zero tariff, while quantities above the minimum access amount are charged much higher and often prohibitive <b>tariffs.</b> <b>Tariff</b> rate <b>quotas</b> cause the excess supply curve facing an importing country to be discontinuous at the minimum access amount.

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier tariff rate import quota system. Although Taiwan maintained land set-asides and domestic support prices for producer sales to the State Trading Enterprise, the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, land set-aside and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and land set-aside improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments. But the policy regime of the <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> (the in-quota tariff versus the out-of-quota tariff versus the quota) and hence social welfare is sensitive to changes in both domestic policy instruments and market structure. tariff rate quota, strategic alliance, domestic support, market structure, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the amount of "policy space" {{available}} to increase tariff protection in South African agriculture. To this end, formal definitions for agricultural produce, actual import data, applied tariff data and bound tariff rates and <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> information were used to investigate the extent to which it is possible and feasible to increase tariffs. The analysis shows that in general the policy space available to South African agriculture is limited because of, among others, WTO binding and treaty obligations under the EU and SADC agreements. Furthermore, it does not make policy sense to increase protection on most other products. © 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2008 The Economic Society of South Africa. Articl...|$|E

A wide-held suspicion explains this with <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> administration imposing an extra barrier to trade. It is the aim of this paper to test whether different administrative methods do indeed contribute to explain variation in fill rates and if so, how.
