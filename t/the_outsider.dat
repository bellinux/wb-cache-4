5|$|The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally {{injured by}} a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan {{blood and the}} Gurak half of <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> to anoint his right arm.

5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given <b>the</b> <b>outsider</b> Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E

5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was <b>The</b> <b>Outsider,</b> a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E

As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running.

In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as <b>the</b> <b>outsider</b> overhauled the favourite.|$|E
