The tuned up procedure employs simultaneously two different EKF: {{the first one}} estimates gust disturbances, the second one affords to determine the necessary controls displacements for rejecting those ones. In particular, the first filter, by using instrumental measurements gathered in turbulent air, estimates wind components. The second one obtains command laws able to follow the desired <b>flight</b> <b>path.</b> To perform this task aerodynamic coefficients have been modified by adding entirely new derivatives or synthetic increments to basic ones whose might the kind of change required to reject disturbances. Such a procedure leads {{to a set of}} unknown stability and control parameters containing the required displacements of the controls. The modified aircraft parameters are determined by augmenting the aircraft’s state. The filter estimates the new set of aircraft stability derivatives by using measurements made by the desired <b>take-off</b> or landing <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> parameters. Once the unknown stability and control derivatives have been determined, the obtained control displacements are used to perform an accurate path following in turbulent air. Obviously, the obtained control laws are adaptive since they depend by either the characteristics of the disturbance or the desired <b>flight</b> <b>path.</b> The proposed procedure requires low computational power, therefore it is particularly suited for UAS, besides being simple to implement on board it may be successfully employed on low cost platforms...|$|R

Significant work has been done in the area of noise effects reflecting different aspects of annoyance and human health considerations. This is a critical issue that affects the sustainability of commercial aviation. Different solutions have been attempted to control aircraft noise at airports.

40|$|Introduction: When {{deriving}} {{an objective}} assessment of piloting performance from flight data records, {{it is common}} to employ metrics which purely evaluate errors in <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> parameters. The adequacy of pilot performance is evaluated from the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> of the aircraft. However, in large jet transport aircraft these measures may be insensitive and require supplementing with frequency-based measures of control input parameters. Method: <b>Flight</b> <b>path</b> and control input data were collected from pilots undertaking a jet transport aircraft conversion course during a series of symmetric and asymmetric approaches in a flight simulator. The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> data were analyzed for deviations around the optimum <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> while flying an instrument landing approach. Manipulation of the flight controls was subject to analysis using a series of power spectral density measures. Results: The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> metrics showed no significant differences in performance between the symmetric and asymmetric approaches. However, control input frequency domain measures revealed that the pilots employed highly different control strategies in the pitch and yaw axes. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that to evaluate pilot performance fully in large aircraft, it is necessary to employ performance metrics targeted at both the outer control loop (<b>flight</b> <b>path)</b> and the inner control loop (flight control) parameters in parallel, evaluating both the product and process of a pilot's performance...|$|R
