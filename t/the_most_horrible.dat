She considered {{the day of her}} liberation as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents and siblings gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, active in Hashomer Hatzair, was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E

500|$|The nuckelavee (...) or nuckalavee is a horse-like demon from Orcadian mythology that {{combines}} equine and human elements. It has {{its origins in}} Norse mythology, and is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> of all the demons of Scotland's Northern Isles. The nuck component of its name may be cognate with Nick in Old Nick, {{a name for the}} Christian Devil. The nuckelavee's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and the creature was held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite its being predominantly a sea-dweller.|$|E

A soldier of the New York 114th wrote: [...] "The men soon learned the pernicious habit of slyly leaving their places in the ranks when opposite a planter's house.... Oftentimes a soldier can be found with such an enormous development of the organ of destructiveness that the most severe punishment cannot deter him from indulging in the breaking of mirrors, pianos, and the most costly furniture.

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{develops}} on these themes of oppression, both {{the narrator and}} Pintilie {{look back on the}} age of Greater Romania with a dose of nostalgia. Simon writes: [...] "What was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> summer {{in the life of a}} young mother, driving her to drink and wasting away, was for her small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life." [...] Variety argues: [...] "The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light." [...] Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: [...] "Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film." ...|$|E

500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to come into your home to look for changes you can make. They {{make you feel like}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> person in the world and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E
500|$|Even in prison, Lim was hated; {{his fellow}} prisoners abused and treated {{him as an}} outcast. In the years that {{followed}} the crime, memories remained fresh among those who followed the case. [...] Journalists deemed it the most sensational trial of the 80s, being [...] "the talk of a horrified city as gruesome accounts of sexual perversion, the drinking of human blood, spirit possession, exorcism and indiscriminate cruelty unfolded during the 41-day hearing". [...] Fifteen years from the trial's conclusion, a poll conducted by The New Paper reported that 30 per cent of its respondents had picked the Toa Payoh ritual murders as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> crime, despite the paper's request to vote only for crimes committed in 1998. [...] Lim had become a benchmark for local criminals; in 2002 Subhas Anandan described his client, wife-killer Anthony Ler, as a [...] "cooler, more handsome version of [...] notorious Toa Payoh medium-murderer".|$|E
500|$|The band took {{a two-week}} hiatus between the European and Japanese {{legs of the}} tour, which began in May 1992. Minutes before the Chili Peppers were {{scheduled}} to perform in Tokyo, Frusciante refused to go on stage, claiming he quit the band. After {{half an hour of}} coaxing, Frusciante agreed to play the show, though he asserted it would be his last. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "It was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> show ever. Every single note, every single word, hurt, knowing that we were no longer a band. I kept looking over at John and seeing this dead statue of disdain... And that night, John disappeared from the topsy-turvy world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers."

[...] Winston Churchill, July 11, 1944 In the first few decades of the 20th century the Jews of Hungary numbered roughly 5 percent of the population. This minority had managed to achieve great commercial success, and Jews were disproportionately represented in the professions, relative to their numbers.|$|R
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|Voltaire {{actively}} rejected Leibnizian optimism {{after the}} natural disaster, {{convinced that if}} this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ("Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief. He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> disasters [...] "in {{the best of all possible}} worlds". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide, has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar.|$|E
500|$|Yang's {{relationship}} with Burke was positively received; {{it was considered}} as [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} relationships on the show". Similarly, The Orange County Register wrote that their romance became [...] "one of the most touching and funny attractions of Grey's Anatomy." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN was critical of their wedding planning in the third season, saying: [...] "The will-they's and won't-they's fly and fall like hobbled pigeons until the season finale when the show solves both its personal and professional problems in the most obvious and least compelling of ways." [...] UGO.com placed their break-up on its list of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> TV breakups. In 2009, Monfette said of Yang's {{relationship with}} Owen: [...] " [...] interactions with Cristina were perfectly balanced for optimum drama, never together and never apart for so long that the back-and-forth became frustrating. Viewers could clearly see a softening of the typically hard-edged Cristina, a pleasant change for what had become something of a one-note character." ...|$|E

During the evening a number of Christians (fomented by fanatic Catholic preachers inspired by the inquisitorial repression) slaughtered about 360 innocents causing a total and fierce devastation in La Giudecca.

500|$|The South Park {{football}} team plays a rival team from Middle Park, Colorado. Like South Park itself, Middle Park is an actual basin in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado. Matt Stone said the Middle Park kids {{were made to}} seem richer and cooler than the South Park students {{because that was the}} perception real South Park residents have of the actual Middle Park. Richard Stamos, who sings during halftime in the episode's football game, is the fictional brother of John Stamos, a real-life actor best known for his roles on Full House and ER. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not know Stamos when they wrote [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", but Parker said they assumed he was [...] "a big douche" [...] because of his role on Full House, which Parker called [...] "just <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible</b> thing ever put on television". Since the episode aired, however, Parker and Stone have become acquainted with Stamos and found him to be [...] "a really, really cool guy". John Stamos told them he loved the inclusion of the Richard Stamos character in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". Richard Stamos sings [...] "Lovin' You", a 1975 hit single by singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Parker chose it because he felt it was a popular song in the gay community, and also because, [...] "I've just always hated that song. I hate any song from that era, really. It's just a horrible time for music." ...|$|E
500|$|Changeling {{sits with}} other late-period Eastwood films in which parenting—and {{the search for}} family—is a theme. It makes literal the parental {{struggle}} to communicate with children. It {{can also be seen}} as a variation of the Eastwood [...] "revenge movie" [...] ethic; in this case, the [...] "avenging grunt" [...] transforms into a courteous woman who only once makes a foul-mouthed outburst. Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in A Perfect World(1993) and Mystic River(2003). Changeling is a thematic companion piece to Mystic River, which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated, violent act against a child—a comparison with which Eastwood agreed. He said that showing a child in danger was [...] "about the highest form of drama you can have", as crimes against them were to him <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>horrible.</b> Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence. He said, [...] "When [...] comes along quite as big as this one, you question humanity. It never ceases to surprise me how cruel humanity can be." [...] Samuel Blumenfeld of Le Monde said the scene featuring Northcott's execution by hanging was [...] "unbearable" [...] due to its attention to detail; he believed {{it one of the most}} convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable. Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment, Northcott was an ideal candidate, and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime. He said that crimes against children would be at the top of his list for justifications of capital punishment, but that whether one were pro- or anti-capital punishment, the barbarism of public executions must be recognized. Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings, and his feet shake. It was Eastwood's intention to make it unbearable to watch.|$|E
