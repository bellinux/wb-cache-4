40|$|AbstractWith {{more and}} more <b>data</b> <b>buoys</b> are {{produced}} to study the oceans, how to deploy them in a convenient and economic way is very important. In the past, the deployment is often accomplished by large special vessel, which {{needs a lot of}} manpower and material resources. Here we introduce a novel deploying method for moored <b>data</b> <b>buoy</b> based on small vessel. This method employs a small vessel with two pulleys(one is served as movable pulley, the other is stable pulley.) and a winch. By way of the relay, it drops all the mooring chain into the water step by step. At last, the anchor is made into ocean water. After several experiments inspection, this anchor-last deploying method for moored <b>data</b> <b>buoy</b> is safe and efficient...|$|R

40|$|Two {{analyses}} are performed {{to evaluate the}} effect of drift buoys and the FGGE's special observing system (SOS) on forecasting. The FGGE analysis utilizes all level II-b conventional and special data, and the Nosat analysis employs only surface and conventional upper air data. Twelve five-day forecasts are produced from these data. An additional experiment utilizing the FGGE <b>data</b> base minus <b>buoys</b> <b>data,</b> and the Nosat <b>data</b> base including <b>buoys</b> <b>data</b> is being conducted. The forecasts are compared and synoptic evaluation of the effect of <b>buoys</b> <b>data</b> is described. The results reveal that the FGGE data base with the SOS significantly improves forecasting in the Southern Hemisphere and the loss of <b>buoys</b> <b>data</b> does not have a great effect on forecasting.

40|$|Knowing the {{efficiency}} of a pumping unit has important operational and financial benefits to those who operate the unit. Historically efficiency is collected on a periodic basis through on-site collection of the necessary parameters. Unit efficiency can be calculated on a real time basis by combining <b>telemetered</b> <b>data</b> with fluid properties in a Real Time Transient Model (RTTM). This method however needs to be validated {{in order to ensure}} it is equivalent to field efficiency testing. The RTTM was expanded to be able to calculate unit efficiency utilizing <b>telemetered</b> <b>data</b> and modeled fluid properties. Three crude oil and two refined products units were configured in the model to perform the calculations. Data from each of the units was stored in a relational database for later analysis. Date and time, efficiency ratio (current efficiency/manufacturer’s efficiency), flow rate and viscosity were stored once every fifteen minute. Field efficiency test data was retrieved and then compared to the <b>telemetered</b> <b>data.</b> A deviation of one percent or less was considered acceptable. Where the two methods did not correlate within the required one percent, the data was analyzed to determine the root cause. Errors in the model’s algorithms and potential errors in field data collection account for all departures. This research supports the use of the RTTM to calculate unit efficiency.
