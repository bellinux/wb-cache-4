30|$|Both dyad groups, whether <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> search {{independently}} or splitting search, {{were significantly}} more accurate than individual searchers (t(11.479)[*]=[*] 5.36, p[*]<[*] 0.001 and t(35.087)[*]=[*] 2.885, p[*]=[*] 0.007, respectively). A final t-test confirmed that dyads <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> search independently were more accurate than those <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> split search (t(8.699)[*]=[*] 3.053, p[*]=[*] 0.014). Dyads who <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> split search took significantly less time to search than individuals (t(37.824)[*]=[*]– 2.83, p[*]=[*] 0.007) {{but there was no}} significant difference between dyads who <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> search independently and individuals (t(5.162)[*]=[*] 1.079, p[*]=[*] 0.328). The difference in search time between dyads who <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> search independently and dyads who <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> split search failed to reach significance (t(4.389)[*]=[*] 2.315, p[*]=[*] 0.076).|$|R

5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E
50|$|Flowers of “Dendrobium pulchellum”, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be {{fragrant}} {{with broad}} leaves. The leaves of Charming pulchellum <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be very fragile and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be larger in size {{when compared to}} other sub-species. They are erect when they are young and as they age they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> droop due to their increasing size.|$|R

Adoption by same-sex couples {{was supported by}} 56% (35% fully support, 21% <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> support) and opposed by 37% (22% fully oppose, 15% <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> oppose).|$|R
5|$|Like many large, active sharks, {{this species}} adapts poorly to captivity; it <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> bump into {{the sides of}} its enclosure, and the {{resulting}} abrasions then become infected with often fatal consequences.|$|E
5|$|Phineas is {{also very}} modest. He <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> put Ferb's name on inventions. This may be because Ferb {{does most of the}} building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E

Low sensation seekers <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> prefer more structured, well-defined tasks involving order and routine. Males high in sensation seeking <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> choose scientific {{and social service}} professions. Among females, traditional vocations (e.g. housewife or home economics teacher) <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be associated with low sensation seeking.|$|R

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{heating effect}} of binary star systems works {{to prevent an}} initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a binary system, the orbit of the latter pair <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> contract, releasing energy. Only after the primordial supply of binaries is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> significantly accelerate core collapse.|$|E

Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually.|$|E
