Perceptions of tourists and <b>tourist</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishment</b> regarding climate change threats to tourism are explored for the towns of St Francis Bay and Cape St Francis. Tourism accommodation establishments were predominantly concerned with day-to-day changes in weather, investing in small-scale infrastructural changes to improve the comfort of their guests. By contrast, tourists demonstrated greater concern for the risk of flooding, sea-level rise and the degeneration of the beaches. This reflects concerning disjunctures between perceptions of tourists and accommodation establishments regarding climate change threats. This may portray to tourists insufficient investment in adaptation at accommodation establishments, resulting in decreased tourist visitations in the short-term in favour of destinations perceived as better prepared...|$|E

The unfavourable situation of the tourism in Romania is doubled by the same situation at regional level. In order to point out the regional disparities in tourism developing, a regression analysis becomes useful. The analysis is focused on representative indicators as: <b>tourist</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishments,</b> nights spent at <b>tourist</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishments,</b> seasonality in tourism nights per month, net occupancy rates of bed-places and bedrooms in hotels, or regional GDP/capita.

40|$|Prague, {{with its}} monuments of great {{historical}} and artistic value, {{has been gaining}} popularity in recent years. It {{has become one of}} the most important tourist destinations in Central Europe. This is the reason why hotel industry in this city is developing so quickly – there are 654 collective <b>tourist</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishments</b> with 547 hotels, motels, pensions and residences, which is more than 83 %. Establishments, located in the old, historical buildings, are among the most interesting hotel groups in the city. For the purpose of this project, hotels located in buildings erected before the beginning of World War II, operating during the research that took place from the beginning of July to the end September 2008 and which have 10 or more rooms (according to Czech definition of the hotel) were taken into consideration. Historical hotels in Prague are mostly collective <b>tourist</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishments</b> in the historical city center, in Prague 1 district, where 135 establishments of this type operate (September 2008), which is almost 80 % in this administrative district and a quarter in the whole city. This shows a great potential of this kind of facilities, covering a great range of hotel market in Prague. The main advantage of these establishments is their location directly in the city centre which is also the main tourism, business and political core. The vicinity of the main tourist attractions, as well as public institutions, shopping venues and business centers, is the main reason why the historical hotels are so popular among the people visiting Prague. It is important to mention, that such a great location is strictly connected with the higher price in comparison to hotels situated further away from the center. The majority of historical hotels are rather small in size. 88 of them (65 % of the total) offer less than 50 rooms, and on the other hand, only 14 (about 10 %) have more than 100 rooms. Historical hotels in Prague 1 district are mostly upper class hotels, ranging from 3 stars above. Almost half of all hotels in this district (about 49 %) are 4 -star hotels and 27 of them are luxurious 5 -star hotels with an outstandingly exclusive service. Most of the mentioned hotels are privately owned by individuals, families or different companies. In addition to this, many of them are associated within different organizational structures, such as hotels chains, systems or groups, often of international or even global range. The main and the most interesting attribute of these hotels is their location in interesting, unique buildings, often of great historical and artistic value. They are mostly located in tenement houses, but also in such places as former stables, hospitals, convents or banks. It significantly influences their attractiveness and creates unique atmosphere of the hotel, which is perfect for guests looking for new sensations. This is the main feature giving the hotel its own “spirit of the place” which is important in creating its outstanding brand and often a long lasting tradition. Despite the favorable location and the atmosphere, historical hotels also have problems of their own. Among the most important ones is the constant protection of the building by the building conservation officer, as the centre of Prague is on UNESCO World Heritage List, which often makes it difficult to renovate the hotel or add new facilities, for example to adopt the building for people with reduced mobility. This is the reason, why small, historical hotels often cannot compete with big, modern and well equipped hotels, located just a few steps away from the city centre. To conclude, it is easy to assume that historical hotels of “Golden Prague” are creating a unique web of original establishments, offering a wide range of various services – from economical to luxury class – to their guests. All of them have a great potential for future development, but some problems may also occur and are more likely to happen to them than in the case of “traditional” hotels...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. (Environmental Management) Abstract: There {{is growing}} global concern {{of climate change}} {{together}} with its associated impacts on the natural environment, economic activities and on humans. One of the areas of concern is the tourism sector. Climate change is already affecting the sector and is becoming more evident through the effects that are being experienced. Furthermore, the tourism sector is also substantially contributing to the global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through the long hauling of tourists and emphasis on tourist comfort. Climate is an important resource for tourism, and especially for nature based tourism as the changing climates and weather patterns at tourist destinations can significantly affect the tourist`s comfort and alter their choice of destinations. A reduction in the tourist flows will have negative impacts on tourism sector and also creates a knock off effect on communities and auxiliary service providers that benefit from tourism. Developing countries are likely to suffer the most as the tourism sector is major a contributor to their economies. Zimbabwean tourism heavily relies on its natural environment for tourist attractions, thus climate change is a huge threat to the environment. This research investigated climate change perceptions within the tourism sector in Hwange through how the tourism sector is adapting to climate change. The study area was Hwange National Park (HNP), located in Hwange which is a semi-arid region and the whole area is heavily dependent on the tourism sector as an economic driver. Results from the research indicate that, the <b>tourists,</b> <b>tourist</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishments,</b> HNP employees and the Government of Zimbabwe are aware of climate change threats and are gravely concerned about its impacts on tourism. However, very limited action is being taken in this regard. The increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events being experienced in Hwange {{has resulted in the}} increase in climate change concerns within the tourism stakeholders. Nevertheless, the tourism sector in Hwange is faced with a myriad of problems that threaten business and profitability hence, tourism stakeholders are mainly focusing on maintaining their businesses, supply of water and adjusting to a volatile economic and political environment. There is a serious lack of climate change planning from the government, local authorities and tourism stakeholders to deal with climate change impacts. The research results indicate that there is a serious need for further climate change research to aid in policy making within Zimbabwe...|$|R

The research methodology that was used consisted in the statistical data collection in order to gather representative information {{on the evolution of}} tourism for the 2008 - 2011, in Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion. In {{the first part of the}} research is presented an analysis regarding the evolution of the number of tourists within the <b>tourist</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishments</b> in the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion. The analysis is based on the following aspects: the evolution of the number of tourists within the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion is presented; a comparison regarding the number of national tourists registered in the two counties belonging to the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion and finally an analysis based on the number of foreign tourists registered within the two counties belonging to the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion. In the second part of the research, the study continues with the analysis of the activities of the hotel units from Bihor and Hajdú-Bihar starting from the data obtained from the Bihor County Statistics Department, for Bihor County, and from the Debrecen Central Statistics Office, for the Hajdú-Bihar data. The research covers the period from 2008 - 2011, following the indicators regarding: the number of active units, turnover, and employee related expenses, staff and gross investments in tangible assets. This statistical and economic analysis presents on one hand the centralization of the indicators used within a table, (initially, in a rough form and subsequently in a shaped form based on the annual average exchange rates of the leu and forint compared to the euro during 2008 - 2011) and on the other the evolution of each indicator in chart form. Due to the fact that a part of the analyzed indicators are expressed in the national currency of the two countries (Romania and Hungary), I have used the annual average exchange rates of the leu and forint compared to the euro, in order to bring them to comparable units of measurement. The sources of information for these were the websites of the National Bank of Romania, for the annual average leu/euro exchange, and The Central Bank of Hungary for the annual average forint/euro exchange rate...|$|R

In recent years, Russians have become {{the largest group of}} foreign <b>tourists</b> in Finnish <b>accommodation</b> <b>establishments.</b> For example, a total of 231, 453 overnight stays were reported for Russian tourists in January 2011. This was almost 51 per cent of all overnight stays. Also, in 2009 the proportion of Russian tourists contributing to Finland's two-billion-euro income from international tourists was 31 per cent. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to describe how Russia and Russian tourists have reacted to tourist-related strategies in Finland generally, and especially in Karelia, which is a Finno-Russian cross-border region. The qualitative research is based on official Finnish tourism strategies and the Karelia region's official tourism strategies (n= 5). According to the results, one of the advantages of Finland is its close proximity to Russia, which means easy access for Russian tourists. The main strategic goal in Finland generally and especially in the Karelia region, is to extensively exploit Russia's markets and the purchasing power of Russians. The strategic goals emphasise such things as infrastructure, services development and cooperation between the different actors in Finland and Russia. Knowing the mutual history of Finland and Russia is remarkable that Russian tourists are mentioned by name in tourism strategies...|$|R
