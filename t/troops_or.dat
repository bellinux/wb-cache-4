5|$|On 21 February, Souvanna {{signed an}} Agreement on the Restoration of Peace and Reconciliation in Laos between the central {{government}} and the Pathet Lao. The agreement was preceded by intense fighting, as both sides attempted to seize as much territory as possible before the cease-fire went into effect. The agreement was moot, however, since Hanoi {{had no intention of}} removing its <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> abandoning its logistical system.|$|E

Eight days later an additional 70 donkeys, 65 lorries in the 1040 Motor Transport Company, 110 camels in 'M' Company Camel Transport Corps, were added.|$|E
5|$|There were, of course, {{numerous}} {{reasons for}} maintaining roads. A unified political {{system could be}} maintained {{only as long as}} the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, <b>troops,</b> <b>or</b> messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of naval base development.|$|E
5|$|SS Samuel Huntington was an American liberty ship during World War II. She was the 248th liberty ship {{authorized}} by the United States Maritime Commission and was {{named in honor of}} Samuel Huntington, a signer of the American Declaration of Independence. SS Samuel Huntington was launched in 1942 and sailed to ports in the Pacific, South America, Africa, and the United Kingdom. She was one of a select group of liberty ships that were outfitted to carry a limited number of either <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> prisoners of war. As part of a convoy to resupply the Allied troops at Anzio, she sank after a successful German bomb attack in January 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War refocused {{discussions about}} the road. There were fears that Great Britain would enter {{on the side of}} the Confederacy during the early days of the war. British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario, and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the {{proposed}} roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, severing communication lines through the Great Lakes. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> supplies could be moved to the Copper Country except by land. The road was also needed during the five or six months of the year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War gave Finland {{a window of opportunity}} to achieve this. The Finns sought aid from both the German Empire and the Bolsheviks to that end, and on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the country's independence. The new Bolshevik Russian government was weak, and soon the Russian Civil War would break out. Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin could spare no <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> attention for Finland, and consequently, Soviet Russia recognized the new Finnish government just three weeks after the declaration of independence. In 1918, the Finns fought a short civil war, where the pro-Bolshevik Red Guards were armed by 7,000 to 10,000 Russian troops stationed in Finland.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
5|$|In {{summing up}} the counterattack, US Army {{official}} historian John Miller {{argues that the}} Japanese offensive failed due to poor planning and intelligence. The Japanese commanders underestimated {{the strength of the}} US defenders, but even if XIV Corps had been as weak as the Japanese believed, the force committed to the attack did not include enough <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> artillery to penetrate the well-prepared defenses. In the event, the defenders greatly outnumbered the Japanese force and had far superior artillery support. Miller argues further that the attack might have achieved a degree of success, {{at least in terms of}} inflicting heavy casualties on the US forces, had Hyakutake concentrated his forces early in the attack, rather than cumulatively, in order to achieve a break in the US line, which he might have been able to exploit to penetrate into the rear areas and cause considerable destruction before the US forces regrouped. Nevertheless, this did not happen and ultimately the veteran US troops held their positions despite the onslaught. Miller opines that had the offensive been successful, it would have had a serious affect on the campaign in the Solomons, resulting in a large drain on Allied resources, but would most likely not have altered the wider course of the war.|$|E

5|$|Many of the Administrators' duties were seasonal, such as {{inspections}} of counties every spring {{to check on}} agriculture and maintain roads, bridges, dikes and other public works. In the fall he sent subordinates into the counties to report whether local criminal lawsuits had been conducted fairly. He was responsible for recommending worthy nominees, known as Filial and Incorrupt, to the capital at the end each year during winter; the nominees would then be considered for an appointment to a central or local government office. This followed a system of quotas {{for each of the}} commanderies that was first established during Emperor Wu's reign, when two Filial and Incorrupt men from each commandery were sent to the capital. This was changed in 92 AD to one man for every 200,000 households in a commandery. After the Commandants of interior commanderies were abolished, the Administrators assumed their duties, yet they were still not allowed to raise militias, mobilize <b>troops,</b> <b>or</b> send troops outside their commandery without permission from the central government.|$|E
5|$|The royal army under Devon and Pembroke intercepted the {{northern}} rebelson their way south {{to meet up}} with Warwick and Clarenceby Banbury in Oxfordshire. It is not clear what happened after this. According to Warkworth, Devon and Pembroke quarrelled over billeting arrangements, and Devon took off with the majority of the archers. The next day, on 26 July 1469, Pembroke met the rebels at the Battle of Edgecote, but without artillery support he was thoroughly defeated. When Devon finally arrived, he was either unable to engage his <b>troops,</b> <b>or</b> too late to make a difference. The French chronicler Jean de Waurin, however, gives a different account. According to Waurin, Devon left the field of battle once he heard news that Clarence was arriving with reinforcements. In either case, Pembroke was captured and executed on Warwick's order. Devon managed to escape, but was later captured by a mob at Bridgwater in Somerset, and executed on 17 August.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plans}} for the British {{airborne}} operations were being discussed, Lieutenant-Colonel George Chatterton, the commander of No. 2 Wing, Glider Pilot Regiment, brought up a problem with the only glider then in theatre, the American Waco CG-4, known in British service as the Hadrian: its small size. The Waco's capacity was only two pilots and thirteen troops, and for cargo either a jeep or an artillery gun but not both together. The plan for Operation Ladbroke involved a coup de main assault on the Ponte Grande Bridge by the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. Using the Horsa glider, which could carry twenty-seven <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> a jeep and gun together, they could deliver a larger force at the bridge during the initial assault. Chatterton decided he needed around forty Horsas, as well as the American Wacos, for the British missions.|$|E

5|$|With {{the support}} of Adolf von Neuenahr and the Count Solms, Gebhard secured some of the {{northern}} and eastern portions of the Electorate, where he held a geographical advantage in his proximity to the rebellious Dutch provinces. In the south, however, Ferdinand's troops hunted the soldiers Gebhard had left in possession of such Oberstift villages as Ahrweiler and Linz; Gebhard's troops were forced out of their strongholds, hunted through the countryside, and eventually captured. By the fall of 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen to Ferdinand's army and many of Gebhard's erstwhile supportersâ€”including his own brotherâ€”had returned home. In some cases, they honored parole agreements made after their capture. A strong supporter, Johann Casimir of Simmern, brother of the powerful Louis VI, Elector Palatine, returned to the Palatine when his brother died. Other supporters were frustrated by Gebhard's chronic inability to pay his <b>troops,</b> <b>or</b> intimidated by threats of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. By late October 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen, although he still held the Godesburg, located near the villages of Godesberg and Friesdorf, the formidable fortress at Bonn, and the fortified village of Poppelsdorf.|$|E
5|$|After Caracalla {{concluded}} {{his campaign}} against the Alamanni, it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with the Greek-Macedonian general and conqueror Alexander the Great. He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to equip 16,000 of his men with Macedonian-style phalanxes, despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation. The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings, both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes, and the second bears similarity to the 'Marian Mules' of the late Roman Republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole, which were in use until at least the 2nd century AD. As a consequence, the Phalangarii of Legio II Parthica {{may not have been}} pikemen, but rather standard battle line <b>troops</b> <b>or</b> possibly Triarii. Caracalla's mania for Alexander went so far that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracalla's increasingly erratic behaviour. But this mania for Alexander, strange as it was, was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Irataba also welcomed {{bands of}} Yavapai onto the {{reservation}} {{after they had}} been subject to massacres by US <b>troops,</b> <b>or</b> suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871â€“72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook.|$|E
