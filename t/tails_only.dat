Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, by lessening the danger from occasional falls. But it does not follow from this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best {{that it is possible to}} conceive under all natural conditions. Let the climate and vegetation change, let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated, unless they also became modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no difficulty, more especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes, each modification being useful, each being propagated, until by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect so-called flying squirrel was produced.|$|E

These statistics were Wald, Score, Likelihood Ratio, Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL), and Deviance. The simulation study was employed. The data were simulated for the logistic regression models with 2 dummy and 2 continuous variables with small sample sizes of 30, 50, and 100. For each sample size 1, 000 simulation runs were made. The empirical distributions of those statistics (upper <b>tails</b> <b>only)</b> were compared with the Chisquare distributions. The upper tail of the distribution is an important segment since it is used for hypothesis testing. The levels of significance (α) were set at 0. 01, 0. 05, and 0. 10. The study found that, for the sample sizes of 30, 50, and 100, the distribution of HL was closest to the Chi-square distribution at all levels of significance.

40|$|Additive fuzzy {{systems can}} filter {{impulsive}} noise from signals. Alpha-stable statistics model the impulsiveness as a parametrized family of probability density functions or unit-area bell curves. The bell-curve parameter ct ranges through the interval (0, 2] {{and gives the}} Gaussian bell curve when 0 t = 2 and gives the Cauchy bell curve when ~t = 1. The impulsiveness grows as ~ falls and the bell curves have thicker <b>tails.</b> <b>Only</b> the Gaussian statistics have finite variances or finite higher moments. An additive fuzzy system can learn ellipsoidal fuzzy rule patches from a new pseudo-covariation matrix or measure of alpha-stable covariation. Mahalanobis distance gives a joint set function for the learned if-part fuzzy sets of the if-then rules. The joint set function preserves input correlations that factored set functions ignore. Competitive learning tunes the local means and pseudo-covariations of the alpha-stable statistics and thus tunes the fuzzy rules. Then the covariation rules can both predict nonlinear signals in impulsive noise and filter the impulsive noise in time-series data. The fuzzy system filtered such noise better than did a benchmark radial basis neural network. 1. Filtering impulsive noise Impulsive noise is not Gaussian. The bell-curve density of impulsive noise has thicker tails than a Gaussian bell curve has. The thicker tails give rise to more frequent bursts of noise. The Cauchy density f(x) = 1 /n(l+x 2) has this property and so do all alpha-stable probability densities [17] for index parameter ~ in 0 < ~t < 2. The Cauchy density is the special case when ct = 1. The thicker polynomial tails give an infinite variance and give infinite higher-order moments. The lower-order fractional moments are still finite. The Gaussian density is the special case of an alpha-stable density when ct = 2. It is unique in this family because it has exponential tails and has finite variance and higher-order moments.

40|$|Abstract: The {{generalized}} Hurst exponent H {{is often}} used to establish multiscaling in nancial time series. In computing H(q) we are concerned with the q-order empirical moment of returns' distribution. Since power-law tails are among the most robust features observed nancial data, our aim is to check if such analysis can be carried out when the returns ' PDF has divergent moments. At an order q for which the theoretical moment doesn't exist, the behaviour of H(q) seriously suers from the niteness of the sample. We show how Pareto tails and a nite data set can result in a spurious multiscaling even for a strictly self-ane process. A process with independent increments distributed according to a Cauchy law should have a constant exponent H; on the contrary we empirically observe bifractality. We nd such behaviour is due to power-law <b>tails</b> <b>only,</b> suggesting that this spurious feature may be common to every scaling process whose increments ' PDF decays according to a power law. Dealing with independent increments we neglect another robust 'stylized fact': the volatility clustering of returns; so we wonder if our above argument still holds when returns are correlated. We take into account some of the oldest and most important Stock Market indexes and, by reshuing the whole series, we nd that Pareto tails give rise to a strong empirical multiscaling, but volatility clustering can attenuate this spurious eect. In computing H(q) from a nite sample one should care about uncertainty. We propose a 'bootstrap ' method to evaluate the reliability of H(q), i. e. its sample dependence. Using this resampling method on real nancial series we nd such uncertainty suddenly start to increases as the order q reaches the value q 0 for which theoretical moments are expected to diverge. The Hurst analysis is no longer reliable in the range of divergent moments. Since the q-dependence of H has been observed for orders close to q 0 or even larger, in our opinion the robustness of this feature is quite doubtful. 1...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the acute effects of several methods (rubber rings, knife and docking iron) of castrating and tailing 4 to 5 week old lambs was performed. The investigation consisted of a study of certain anatomical aspects of the sites of castration and tailing, experimental validation of the behavioural responses as indices of distress, ranking of the various methods of castration and tailing according to the acute responses and testing {{of the effects of}} handling on lambs castrated plus tailed with the knife The innervation of the external genitalia and the tail was described and the pattern of innervation was discussed with respect to castration and tailing. The behaviour elicited by castration and tailing was dependent upon the method used. Following rubber ring application the behaviours exhibited were increased activity, increased recumbency of which a high proportion was lateral, and these behaviours were associated with elevated plasma Cortisol concentrations and are therefore suggested to be indicative of distress. After use of the knife or the docking iron abnormal standing/walking behaviour was associated with elevated plasma Cortisol concentrations and therefore appeared to indicate distress. The behavioural and plasma Cortisol responses continued beyond the 4 hour observational period of the first experiment so a second experiment was performed. It demonstrated that the response to castration plus tailing with the knife approached completion at 8 hours. Handling of lambs to effect blood sampling did not appear to significantly affect the response. Ranking of the methods of castration plus <b>tailing,</b> castration <b>only</b> and <b>tailing</b> <b>only</b> showed that the use of the knife was apparently more distressing than any other procedure. Apparently less distressing than the use of the knife but similar to each other were castration plus tailing with the rings, castration only with the ring, short-scrotum plus tailing with the rings and castration with the ring plus tailing with the docking iron. <b>Tailing</b> <b>only</b> with the ring and <b>tailing</b> <b>only</b> with the docking iron were apparently as distressing as handling with jugular venipuncture, although it is suggested that the quality of the distress apparently experienced would have been different. Thus in order to minimise the acute effects on lambs, there is evidence that the best methods are as follows. 1. For castration plus tailing: castration plus tailing with the rubber rings, short-scrotum plus tailing with the rubber rings or castration with the rubber ring plus tailing with the docking iron. 2. For castration only: castration only with the rubber ring. 3. For <b>tailing</b> only: <b>tailing</b> <b>only</b> with the rubber ring or the docking iron.

40|$|Using the Autodialer thought experiment, we {{show that}} the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA) is too general, and propose a {{revision}} to the assumption that limits its applicability to causally-independent observers. Under the revised assumption, the Doomsday Argument fails, and the paradoxes associated with the standard SSA are dispelled. We also consider {{the effects of the}} revised sampling assumption on tests of cosmological theories. There we find that, while we must restrict our attention to universes containing at least one observer, the total number of observers predicted in each universe is irrelevant to the confirmation of a theory. The Doomsday Argument (Bostrom 1997, 2002; Leslie 1989, 1996) concludes that the prior probability we assign to the short-term extinction of humanity is greatly magnified by our observation that we exist at the present time in human history. Before we discuss the Doomsday Argument itself, it is instructive to examine one of the thought experiments that is held up as its analogue. The following experiment, Cubicles, is a minor variation of the original Incubator described by Bostrom (2002). Cubicles One hundred cubicles are numbered 1 to 100. A coin is flipped to determine how many people will be placed in the cubicles. If the result is heads, one person is placed in all 100 cubicles.

40|$|Over {{a period}} of about 12 years, 30 {{abnormal}} Schistosoma mattheei cercariae were found among a total of approximately 2. 8 million examined. Initially seven were recovered from about 1. 02 million (0. 0007 %), which were examined individually while being counted {{with the aid of a}} stereoscopic microscope. Subsequently, on the strength of relatively high percentages of abnormal individuals recovered when counting cercariae that failed to penetrate into oxen, it appeared that the morphologically abnormal cercariae were unable to swim and would mostly sediment out of a suspension while most of the normal cercariae would remain swimming. This surmise is supported by recovery of 23 morphologically abnormal cercariae (0. 001 %) from about 1. 8 million, by examining the sediment after the cercarial suspension had been left standing undisturbed in glass measuring cylinders. The abnormalities ranged from aberrant <b>tails</b> <b>only</b> (e. g. an underdeveloped tail, or different degrees of schism) or aberrant heads only, to abnormalities of both the heads and tails. A suggested schematic classification of abnormal cercariae is presented. A young, adult hamster was exposed to eight S. mattheei cercariae with complete schism of the shaft of the tail, by pipetting the cercariae onto the shaved abdominal skin of the anaesthetised animal. Two underdeveloped females were subsequently encountered in squash preparations of the liver when the hamster was killed for worm recovery 10 weeks after infection, thus showing that some of the abnormal cercariae were viable. A method is also described for killing and fixing cercariae while retaining some of the shining brilliance of live cercariae, without them becoming shrivelled, granular and semi-opaque, as occurs when cercariae die spontaneously or are killed with heat This is apparently the first report of abnormal cercariae of S. mattheei.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to characterise the physical-chemical {{properties}} of alkylglucosides. Alkylglucosides are non-ionic surfactants synthesized from glucose and a fatty alcohol. The glucose molecule constitutes the hydrophilic head group and the fatty alcohol constitutes the hydrophobic tail. The two parts are linked together with a glucoside bond. In nature, the building and breakage of a glucoside bond are controlled by different enzymes called glucosidases. This makes alkylglucosides highly biodegradable. Alkylglucosides also have low toxicity towards biological life. Therefore, alkylglucosides are very interesting in applications like laundry, car wash, shampoo, personal care products and cosmetics. There are two possible ways of attaching a glucose molecule to the fatty alcohol, viz. a- or b-bond. The two ways give different physical-chemical properties to the alkylglucoside. One such property is different packing in a crystal lattice. In this study, the physical-chemical properties of some short-chain alkylglucosides have been determined, viz. C 8 -, C 9 -, and C 10 -alkylglucosides. Alkylglucosides with a- and b-bonding, as well as straight and branched tails have been studied. The study includes both alkylmonoglucosides, which are anomerically pure, and commercially available alkylpolyglucosides. The study is based on the determination of binary surfactant/water phase diagrams (temperature vs. concentration) and ternary surfactant/ surfactant/water phase diagrams. The different phases in the phase diagram have been investigated to obtain information concerning aggregates size/structure and aggregate-aggregate interactions. Techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) self-diffusion, microscope, small-angel X-ray scattering (SAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fluorescence have been used to determine the physical-chemical properties. A general feature of alkylglucosides is a broad solution phase extending from neat water to approximately 60 - 70 wt% surfactant. At higher surfactant concentrations, liquid crystalline phases are formed. Alkylglucosides with straight tails can form hexagonal, cubic and lamellar liquid crystalline phases, whereas alkylglucosides with branched <b>tails</b> <b>only</b> form lamellar liquid crystalline phases. A conclusion from the study is that alkylglucosides do not form spherical micelles but elongated aggregates. The aggregates size increase significantly when the number of carbon atoms in the tail increase. When there are ten or more carbon atoms in the tail a phase separation occurs at dilute concentration. A mechanism behind the phase separation has been proposed based on the dilution of a surfactant network. Repetition distances and head group areas in the liquid crystalline phases have been calculated. A general observation is the surfactant head group area are fairly unchanged when the concentration increases. An explanation for this behaviour is the glucose molecule requires a certain amount of hydration water. When this condition is met there is no gain in free energy by changing the head group area at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface...|$|E

40|$|Transcription by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) {{represents}} a major control point for regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Yet, the mechanistic details and dynamics {{of a large}} number of transcriptional regulatory processes are currently unknown. Many of these processes, such as chromatin remodeling and epigenetic silencing, are mediated through nucleosomes, which comprise the repeating units of chromatin. Thus, it is of great interest to investigate the real-time dynamics of Pol II when it encounters a nucleosome, and to determine what happens to nucleosomes upon the passage of a transcribing Pol II. It has been shown that a single nucleosome is sufficient to halt or greatly slow transcription by Pol II in vitro, and factors that restrict transcriptional backtracking by Pol II also relieve nucleosome-induced pauses and arrests. These observations suggest that the influence of the nucleosome is mediated through polymerase backtracking. Unfortunately, the temporal resolution provided by these biochemical studies was not sufficient to provide mechanistic information about the nucleosomal barrier. Using optical tweezers, we studied nucleosomal transcription of single Pol II complexes in real time, and obtained direct evidence for the first time that a nucleosome acts as mechanical fluctuating barrier that both increases the tendency of the polymerase to enter a backtracked pause and slows its recovery from these pauses. These changes in pause durations quantitatively agree with a model where temporary rewrapping of the nucleosomal DNA immediately downstream of the backtracked Pol II prevents enzyme recovery from its paused state. Furthermore, our studies revealed that Pol II does not actively separate the nucleosomal DNA from the surface of the histones, but, instead, acts as a ratchet that rectifies local nucleosomal unwrapping events to gain access to downstream DNA and overcome the nucleosomal barrier. In vivo, the histone tails are essential for the regulation of gene expression, so we investigated their direct effect on the dynamics of transcription elongation. We found that removal of the tails favors progression of Pol II into the entry region of the nucleosome, by increasing the DNA fluctuations in this region. However, since our data shows that the magnitude of the barrier to transcription is highest in the central region of the nucleosome, and the <b>tails</b> <b>only</b> affect the entry region of the nucleosome, we investigated what interactions control the strength of the barrier near the nucleosome dyad. To this end, we used nucleosomes with point mutations in the histone-fold domains of H 3 and H 4, mutations that affect histone-DNA contacts at the dyad and that have been shown to partially relieve the requirement of the chromatin remodeling factor SWI/SNF in vivo. We found that these mutations abolish the barrier to transcription in the central region by increasing the local unwrapping rate of the DNA from the surface of the histones near the dyad. We speculate that factors that could bind to the nucleosome and specifically disrupt even a single DNA-histone contact in this region would have a profound effect on transcription. Nucleosomes are disrupted to varying degrees by transcription elongation, with outcomes ranging from partial loss to complete removal and exchange of histones. In vitro studies with the phage SP 6 RNA polymerase and RNA Polymerase III have shown that upon transcription the histone octamer moves upstream, while Pol II leads to the formation of a hexamer whose position on DNA is unchanged. The histone transfer process is believed to involve looping of the DNA template, but claims of template looping have so far relied on indirect evidence. Using atomic force microscopy, we obtained direct evidence of looping in the form of polymerase-nucleosome complexes in which the histones bridge the DNA upstream and downstream of the polymerase simultaneously. We also showed that a small fraction of the transcribed nucleosomes moved upstream of their original position. Significantly, we found that the fraction of the transcribed nucleosomes that are remodeled to hexasomes versus the ones that are transferred as intact octamers depends on the speed of elongation. A simple model involving the kinetic competition between the rates of transcription elongation, histone transfer, and histone-histone dissociation quantitatively rationalizes our observations and unifies results obtained with other polymerases. In conclusion, we show how the finely tuned interplay between polymerase dynamics and nucleosome fluctuations determines the outcome of transcription, and we propose that factors affecting the relative magnitude of these processes provide the physical basis for the regulation of gene expression...|$|E
