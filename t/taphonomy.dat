5|$|The {{cause of}} postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{is not completely}} understood, as the event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous. While {{it is possible that}} more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis, based on established research in the fields of biochemistry and forensic <b>taphonomy,</b> and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a non-viable fetus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Taphonomy</b> is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic <b>taphonomy</b> {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E
40|$|The Silurian rocks within Ohio and Indiana contain carbonates {{deposited}} {{under the}} mineral-precipitating activities of benthic microbes. Fossil microbes occur {{with varying degrees}} of preservation, and an assortment of lithologies contains evidence of microbial influence on the precipitation of micrite and cement. Features indicative of microbial activity include micritic coatings around skeletal grains; laminated, clotted, and micropeloidal fabrics; micrite in forms having independence of gravitational control; and fibrous calcite cement adjacent to well-preserved organic material. The variety of microbial products and their preservational states illustrate that numerous <b>taphonomies</b> and pathways for microbial calcification existed. Fossils of the calcifying microbes Girvanella, Renalcis, and Rothpletzella occur in well-preserved rocks of the Brassfield Formation (Llandovery) cropping out at the Oakes Quarry Park in Fairborn, Ohio.

40|$|Thousands of lingulid brachiopods {{were found}} {{clustered}} beneath hundreds of individual valves of the strophomenid brachiopod Rafinesquina in the Upper Ordovician of Ohio. This association suggested {{a relationship between}} the two brachiopods, but the nature of this relationship was unclear. We utilized serial thin sectioning to examine these brachiopods and to determine the origin of the bed in which they were found. Sedimentary structures, mixed <b>taphonomies,</b> and stratigraphic and paleogeographic setting suggest that the lingulids occupied a hiatal concentration that had previously been reworked, but not significantly transported, by tropical storms. The final burial event was a storm that exhumed living lingulids along with disarticulated Rafinesquina shells from the same sediments. Neither living nor dead shells were transported, but were reworked locally, then reburied together. The lingulids then burrowed upward to escape, but most were trapped by the concavedownward Rafinesquina shells that had been redeposited above them. This finding offers the first documented example of negative ecosystem engineering and taphonomic feedback in the fossil record, as well as the oldest documented lingulid escape traces. It also suggests that taphonomic feedback can be subdivided into live-dead interactions that occur under normal background depositional conditions and those that occur during periodic short-lived sediment-reworking events, such as storms and tsunamis...|$|R
5|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Roach and Brinkman has called into {{question}} the cooperative pack hunting behavior of Deinonychus, based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the <b>taphonomy</b> of tenontosaur sites. Modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) and Komodo dragons display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller Komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is cannibalized. When this information {{is applied to the}} tenontosaur sites, it appears that what is found is consistent with Deinonychus having a Komodo or crocodile-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other Deinonychus. On the other hand, a paper by Li et al. describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways, implying gregarious packing behavior instead of uncoordinated feeding behavior.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the <b>taphonomy</b> by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the <b>taphonomy</b> (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} it has become {{apparent}} that the “cool tropic paradox” of Paleogene and Cretaceous “greenhouse” climates arises because of the diagenetic alteration of tropical planktic foraminiferal calcite near the seafloor, yielding artificially high ? 18 O values. Because the Mg/Ca compositions of foraminiferal and inorganic calcite {{are thought to be}} quite different, Mg/Ca measurements should be a sensitive way of monitoring diagenetic alteration. Here we examine the extent of diagenetic alteration of Eocene planktic foraminiferal calcite using scanning electron microscope imaging of foraminiferal test microstructures and geochemical (? 18 O and Mg/Ca) analyses. We compare microstructural and geochemical characteristics between given species exhibiting two contrasting states of preservation: those that appear “frosty” under reflected light and those that appear “glassy. ” Microstructural evidence reveals extensive diagenetic alteration of frosty foraminiferal tests at the micron scale, while ? 18 O analyses document consistently higher ? 18 O (and therefore lower paleotemperatures) in this material. Yet we find that ? 18 O offsets between species in these frosty foraminiferal assemblages appear to be generally preserved, suggesting that frosty foraminifera remain valuable for generating relatively short (approximately ? 1 Myr) paleoceanographic time series that do not demand absolute estimates of paleotemperature. We also find that the observed increase in Mg/Ca for planktic foraminifera exhibiting diagenetic alteration (compared to glassy <b>taphonomies)</b> is far smaller than would be expected from the addition of inorganic calcite based on laboratory-derived Mg 2 + partition coefficients. Our findings imply that a much lower Mg 2 + partition coefficient controls inorganic calcite formation in deep sea sedimentary sections, in accordance with the findings of Baker et al. (1982) ...|$|R
40|$|Bioturbation at all scales, {{which tends}} to replace the primary fabric of a {{sediment}} by the ichnofabric (the overall fabric of a sediment that has been bioturbated), is now recognised as playing {{a major role in}} facies interpretation. The manner in which the substrate may be colonized, and the physical, chemical and ecological controls (grainsize, sedimentation rate, oxygenation, nutrition, salinity, ethology, community structure and succession), together with the several ways in which the substrate is tiered by bioturbators, are the factors and processes that determine the nature of the ichnofabric. Eleven main styles of substrate tiering are described, ranging from single, pioneer colonization to complex tiering under equilibria, their modification under environmental deterioration and amelioration, and diagenetic enhancement or obscuration. Ichnofabrics may be assessed by four attributes: primary sedimentary factors, Bioturbation Index (BI), burrow size and frequency, and ichnological diversity. Construction of tier and ichnofabric constituent diagrams aid visualization and comparison. The breaks or changes in colonization and style of tiering at key stratal surfaces accentuate the surfaces, and many reflect a major environmental shift of the trace-forming biota. due to change in hydrodynamic regime (leading to non-deposition and/or erosion and/or lithification), change in salinity regime, or subaerial exposure. The succession of gradational or abrupt changes in ichnofabric through genetically related successions, together with changes in colonization and tiering across event beds, may also be interpreted in terms of changes in environmental parameters. It is not the ichnotaxa per se that are important in discriminating between ichnofabrics, but rather the environmental conditions that determine the overall style of colonization. Fabrics composed of different ichnotaxa (and different <b>taphonomies)</b> but similar tier structure and ichnoguild may form in similar environments of different age or different latitude. Appreciation of colonization and tiering styles places ancient ichnofabrics on a sound processrelated basis for environmental interpretation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The thesis {{begins with}} an {{overview}} of hunter-gatherers from an historical perspective and insights from the ethnographic and ethno-ecological literature. Then the prehistoric cultural sequence of the northern boreal forest is examined against the environmental contexts of the research area, specifically a number of Initial Woodland through Terminal Woodland archaeological sites in Northwestern Ontario. Faunal data from the study sites, along with published data from other archaeological sites in NE Ontario and observations from the ethnographic literature, contribute to this section. Analysis and interpretation includes the logistics of site location and observations on possible indications of fire in prehistoric sites from NW Ontario. The faunal data from these sites is in microfiche in the Appendix A. With{{in the context of}} TEK (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) and WSK (Western Scientific Knowledge), fieldwork in modern boreal environments, undertaken in Saskatchewan in 1995, is reported. The assessment of sites follows from their initial selection from infra-red satellite images to their ground-based examination. Soil development, fire history of several areas and observations on fire regimes are explored. The character of patchwork habitat development, and the place of fire regimes and beaver colonisation in this development, are examined. Taphonomic losses at various ecological and cultural levels (<b>Taphonomies</b> I-IV) are considered in the context of theoretical constructs, leading to an interpretative model. Habitat utilisation by prehistoric Northern Boreal forest hunter-gatherers is considered in the final chapter. The role of Beaver as 'keystone species' and the nature of interlinked resources are explored. Fire regimes, and the subsequent development of first stage regrowth patterns as integral parts of the economic system, leads to a model for the management of resources by prehistoric boreal hunters-gatherers. The philosophical implications for the interpretation of hunter-gatherers as effective shapers of an exploited landscape, along with the problematic areas in the research, are outlined in the concluding part of the work...|$|R
5|$|The type {{specimen}} belonged to an aged individual. Its <b>taphonomy</b> is unusual {{as it was}} found lying on its back – in contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides. The specimen was found encased in cross-bedded sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a continuous series that consisted of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position. Both the left limb and rib bones {{were found on the}} right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone, showing that predators had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe geochemical {{composition}} of foraminiferal tests {{is a valuable}} archive for the reconstruction of paleo-climatic, -oceanographic and -ecological changes. However, dissolution of biogenic calcite and precipitation of inorganic calcite (overgrowth and recrystallization) at the seafloor and in the sediment column can potentially alter the original geochemical {{composition of}} the foraminiferal test, biasing any resulting paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The δ 11 B of planktic foraminiferal calcite is a promising ocean pH-proxy but the effect of diagenesis is still poorly known. Here we present new δ 11 B, δ 13 C, δ 18 O, Sr/Ca and B/Ca data from multiple species of planktic foraminifera from time-equivalent samples for two low latitude sites: clay-rich Tanzanian Drilling Project (TDP) Site 18 from the Indian Ocean containing well-preserved (‘glassy’) foraminifera and carbonate-rich Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 865 from the central Pacific Ocean hosting recrystallized (‘frosty’) foraminifera. Our approach makes the assumption that environmental conditions were initially similar at both sites so most chemical differences are attributable to diagenesis. Planktic foraminiferal δ 18 O and δ 13 C records show offsets in both relative and absolute values between the two sites consistent with earlier findings that these isotopic ratios are strongly influenced by diagenetic alteration. Sr/Ca and B/Ca ratios in planktic foraminiferal calcite are also offset between the two sites {{but there is little}} change in the relative difference between surface and deep dwelling taxa. In contrast, δ 11 B values indicate no large differences between well-preserved and recrystallized foraminifera suggesting that despite extensive diagenetic alteration the δ 11 B of biogenic calcite appears robust, potentially indicative of a lack of free exchange of boron between pore fluids and the recrystallizing CaCO 3. Our finding may remove one potential source of uncertainty in δ 11 B based pH reconstructions and provide us with greater confidence in our ability to reconstruct pH in the ancient oceans from at least some recrystallized foraminiferal calcite. However, further investigations should extend this approach to test the robustness of our findings across a range of <b>taphonomies,</b> ages and burial settings...|$|R

In one example these fossils can be analyzed for certain minerals that are known to exist in trace amounts in certain species of plant that can still be detected millions of years later. In another example, the existence of human proteins in coprolites can be used to pinpoint the existence of cannibalistic behavior in an ancient culture. Parasite remains found in human and animal coprolites have also shed new light on questions of human migratory patterns, the diseases which plagued ancient civilizations, and animal domestication practices in the past (see archaeoparasitology and paleoparasitology).|$|E

500|$|The {{paper has}} been {{questioned}} by palaeontologists such as Andrea Cau and Thomas Holtz, who point out that feathers in theropod dinosaurs can grow in the same {{parts of the body}} as scales (as seen in Juravenator), and thus the presence of scales does not actually eliminate the presence of feathers from that part of the body. Furthermore, feathers are delicate structures which can be very easily lost due to taphonomic factors. Paleontologist Mark Witton was warmer to the study, suggesting [...] "we have to concede a scalier appearance than many of us thought likely", while also highlighting that much remains to be determined about tyrannosaurid life appearance. Though acknowledging the role that <b>taphonomy</b> plays in interpreting dinosaur skin, Witton points out that the scale impressions are high quality, consistent in form across all patches, and show no obvious evidence of fibre impressions or spaces for filament attachment, despite the preservation of submillimeter scales.

[...] Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a victim's age, sex, stature, and ancestry.

500|$|The <b>taphonomy</b> (burial and fossilization process) of {{the three}} main Plateosaurus sites—Trossingen, Halberstadt and Frick—is unusual in several ways. All three sites are nearly monospecific assemblages, meaning that they contain {{practically}} only one species, which requires very special circumstances. However, shed teeth of theropods have been found at all three sites, as well as remains of the early turtle Proganochelys. Additionally, a partial [...] "prosauropod" [...] skeleton was found in Halberstadt that {{does not belong to}} Plateosaurus, but is preserved in a similar position. All sites yielded almost complete and partial skeletons of Plateosaurus, as well as isolated bones. The partial skeletons tend to include the hind limbs and hips, while parts of the anterior body and neck are rarely found in isolation. The animals were all adults or subadults (nearly adult individuals); no juveniles or hatchlings are known. Complete skeletons and large skeleton parts that include the hind limbs all rest dorsal (top) side up, as do the turtles. Also, they are mostly well-articulated, and the hind limbs are three-dimensionally preserved in a zigzag posture, with the feet often much deeper in the sediment than the hips.|$|E
500|$|The three known Ankylosaurus skulls {{differ in}} various details; this {{is thought to}} be the result of <b>taphonomy</b> (changes {{happening}} during fossilization of the remains) and individual variation. The skull was low and triangular in shape, wider than it was long. It had a broad beak on the premaxillae. The orbits (eye sockets) were almost round to slightly oval and did not face directly sideways, because the skull tapered towards the front. Crests above the orbits merged into the upper squamosal horns (their shape has been described as [...] "pyramidal"), which pointed backwards to the sides from the back of the skull. The crest and horn were probably separate elements originally, as seen in the related Pinacosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Below the upper horns, jugal horns were present, which pointed backwards and down. The horns may have originally been osteoderms (armor plates) that fused to the skull. The scale pattern on the skull surface was the result of remodelling of the skull itself. This obliterated the sutures between skull elements, which is common for adult ankylosaurs. The scale pattern of the skull was variable between specimens, though some details are shared; it had a diamond-shaped scale (internarial scale) at the font of the snout, two squamosal osteoderms above the orbit, and a ridge of scales at the back of the skull.|$|E
500|$|Although {{sporadic}} work at {{what became}} known as the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Emery County, Utah had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by William L. Stokes in 1945, major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965. The quarry is notable for the predominance of Allosaurus remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod Allosaurus fragilis (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46A. fragilis have been found there, out of at minimum 73dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the <b>taphonomy</b> of the site, suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to drought-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep. Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved Allosaurus remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail, making it among the best-known theropods. Skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes, from less than [...] to [...] long, and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused.|$|E
