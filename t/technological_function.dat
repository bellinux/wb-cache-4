The management model maximizes the amount of groundwater pumped from the Calera aquifer subject to the physical capability of the system. A two dimensional finite difference code is used both to simulate the flow system in the aquifer and compute the response functions at specified locations. To overcome the lack of parameter information, the geostatistical technique of Kriging is used to estimate spatially-averaged log-transmissivities, point estimates of hydraulic head and kriging estimation errors at each cell or node. Semivariograms are validated using both "Jacknife" and Maximum Likelihood cross-validation methods. In addition, the hydraulic head kriging errors are used as a criterion to stop the calibration process of the simulation model.

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} like nanotechnology are being considered {{a driving force}} for innovation. With impacts to be anticipated for nearly every industry, nanotechnology and applications can be considered cross-section or enabling technologies. In this, however, development {{in the fields of}} nanotechnologies is still mostly technology and opportunitydriven. Furthermore, the nanotechnology potential in terms of <b>technological</b> <b>function</b> and utility, with new effects and properties of nano-scaled materials and -structures in particular, are yet to be discovered in enterprises as well as with developers and designers communities. Between the technological bank of nanotechnologies and application banks, a significant gap is to be recognised. Therefore new management approaches are necessary to cope with uncertainty of knowledge in nanotechnology during the early phases of innovation processes and product design. This paper presents an approach for analysing and assessing technology relevance nanotechnology in product planning context. The assessment is based on a product function-related feasibility analysis covering several factors for potential success. The objective is to match the potential effects and properties of nano-materials and -structures with product functions to high-light feasible application fields. Thus, enterprises get a specific assessment of where and how they can apply nanotechnology.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{addresses}} the cultural {{significance of the}} Australian Early Development Index (AEDI) and discusses changes that the discourse of this instrument makes {{to the way in}} which the child is conceptualised. It analyses the <b>technological</b> <b>function</b> of the AEDI to examine how it makes the child a universal resource for human capital. The article examines messages in promotional and research literature surrounding the AEDI that represent it as a reliable statistical instrument which will promote social justice and equity for young children and their families. The scholarly discourse has so far failed to address the broader context of neo-liberal economic and social reform from which the AEDI – and its Canadian predecessor, the Early Development Instrument (EDI) – initially emerged. The article therefore interrogates the EDI and the AEDI as mechanisms for refining and expanding markets in the management and regulation of children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their accompanying vulnerability. These market expansions draw upon econometric theoretical sources, leading to conceptual changes relating to understandings of children and new concepts and practices for the early childhood education sector. Discourses surrounding the use of the AEDI are informed, in part, by perceptions about the breakdown of the family and the impact this will have for long-term sources of social and economic cohesion. The article examines the symbolism entailed by the ways in which the literature surrounding the AEDI and EDI addresses moral and civil sources of authority in modern Western civilisation...|$|E

The components employed as excipients must present the characteristics required by their <b>technological</b> <b>function</b> but, as with any substance administered to man, they must also correspond to suitable safety requirements. In fact, in the past the importance of evaluating the possible adverse effects of excipients was underestimated, because their inertia and innocuity were taken for granted. The safety profile of these substances is more deeply researched as regards the toxicological aspect only if they are also employed in the food industry (anti-oxidants, sweeteners, colouring agents, etc.). Indeed, in this case, the International Toxicological Committees (among which the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, a mixed committee of the WHO/FAO) demand thorough studies in laboratory animals, with the intent of protecting the consumer’s safety. Tackling the question of the toxicity of excipients thoroughly is not a simple matter for several reasons: the large number of substances on the market and the diversity of their chemical profiles, their sources, their technological functions, and the presence of secondary products and/or contaminants that may be the true causes of adverse effects.

Current sources for such training include special "productivity centers," departments or institutes of management science at various Latin American universities, technical personnel of North American firms, and professional academicians of North American educational institutions. If the level of private business between North and South America increases, {{it would be quite}} reasonable for North American firms to assume a greater responsibility for the transfer of management science techniques to Latin America. This paper describes an actual case study of the application of management science to the business and operational problems of a Latin American meat processing firm.

In conjunction with the local management, the study was conducted by Ogden's department of Operations Research. The following aspects of the Latin American firm were analyzed for possible application of management science techniques: (1) organization structure, (2) ranch operations, (3) product mix problems, (4) investment analysis, and (5) inventory control. Based on Ogden's experiences in a typical Latin American business setting, we attempt here to describe some of the present problems and the future potential for management science applications in Latin America. Major problems of implementation identified in this case and considered typical to Latin America are: (1) lack of qualified personnel, (2) lack of EDP facilities, and (3) existence of traditional cultural and political barriers to scientific approaches. However, because of a rising <b>technological</b> <b>function,</b> management science application offers a fertile territory in Latin America. ...|$|E

To do that, methylcellulose gum was added (MC) in different concentrations in the covering systems, batter (coating liquid) and breading (covering expresses). Five experiments were carried out, a standard experiment, without ingredient addition with <b>technological</b> <b>function,</b> formulations with addition of MC in the batter (0, 5 % and 2, 0 %), with addition of MC in the batter and in the breading (1 % in each) and with addition of MC in the breading (2, 0 %). Results showed that fat uptake reduction in formulations with 0, 5 and 2, 0 % of MC in the batter were of 5, 81 % and 8, 40 %, respectively, and in experiments with 1 % of MC in the batter and 1 % of MC in the breading was of 7, 66 %. In experiments that received 2 % of MC in the breading, fat uptake reduction was of 10, 51 %. Formulations with 2 % of MC added to the breading (10, 51 %) and 2 % of MC added to the batter (8, 40 %) presented the largest reductions in fat uptake during the pre-fried stage. Analysis of sensorial acceptance showed that all formulations had a superior acceptance index of 70 %, with no significant difference among the other tested formulations acceptance results (p < 0, 05). These findings show the efficiency of MC as a fat uptake barrier during the pre-fried stage, increasing humidity content, and becoming an advantageous technological alternative for the food industry...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} philosophical controversies {{surrounding the}} evaluation of medical treatments, {{with a focus on}} the evidential roles of randomised trials and mechanisms in Evidence-Based Medicine. Current 'best practice' usually involves excluding non-randomised trial evidence from systematic reviews in cases where randomised trials are available for inclusion in the reviews. The first paper challenges this practice and evaluates whether adding of evidence from non-randomised trials might improve the quality and precision of some systematic reviews. The second paper compares the alleged methodological benefits of randomised trials over observational studies for investigating treatment benefits. It suggests that claims about the superiority of well-conducted randomised controlled trials over well-conducted observational studies are justified, especially when results from the two methods are contradictory. The third paper argues that postulating the unpredictability paradox in systematic reviews when no detectable empirical differences can be found requires further justification. The fourth paper examines the problem of absence causation in the context of explaining causal mechanisms and argues that a recent solution (Barros 2013) is incomplete and requires further justification. Solving the problem by describing absences as causes of 'mechanism failure' fails {{to take into account the}} effects of absences that lead to vacillating levels of mechanism functionality (i. e. differences in effectiveness or efficiency). The fifth paper criticises literature that has emphasised functioning versus 'broken' or 'non-functioning' mechanisms emphasising that many diseases result from increased or decreased mechanism function, rather than complete loss of function. Mechanistic explanations must account for differences in the effectiveness of performed functions, yet current philosophical mechanistic explanations do not achieve this. The last paper argues that the standard of evidence embodied in the ICE theory of <b>technological</b> <b>function</b> (i. e. testimonial evidence and evidence of mechanisms) is too permissive for evaluating whether the proposed functions of medical technologies have been adequately assessed and correctly ascribed. It argues that high-quality evidence from clinical studies is necessary to justify functional ascriptions to health care technologies. QC 20150312 </p...|$|E
