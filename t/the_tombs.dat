5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> are {{not open}} to the public (18 of <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside <b>the</b> <b>tombs,</b> and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through <b>the</b> <b>tombs.</b> This is to minimize time in <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration.

5|$|Despite its name, the Valley of the Kings also {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> of favorite nobles {{as well as}} the wives and children of both nobles and pharaohs. Therefore, only about 20 of <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> actually contain the remains of kings. The remains of nobles and of the royal family, together with unmarked pits and embalming caches, make up the rest. Around the time of Ramesses I (ca. 1301 BC) construction commenced in the separate Valley of the Queens.|$|E

5|$|The desecration of the {{two most}} sacred sites of Merina royalty {{represented}} a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the French colonial power. In the popular view, the link between Ambohimanga and the ancestors (Andrianampoinimerina in particular) rendered the royal city an even more potent symbol and source of legitimate power than the capital of Antananarivo, which was seen as having become a locus of corrupt politics and deviance from ancestral tradition. Believing that the presence of the ancestors within <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> sanctified the earth upon which the rova was built, Menalamba resistance fighters would come to Ambohimanga to collect handfuls of dirt from the base of <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> to carry with them in their offensives against the French; the French authority intended by the removal of the sovereigns' bodies from <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> to undermine the fighters' confidence and solidarity. Although <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> were desecrated and the Menalamba fighters were ultimately defeated, Ambohimanga has retained its sacred character. The royal tombs were reconstructed in 2008 by the government of Madagascar under the Ravalomanana administration. During the 1995 fire that destroyed <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> and other structures at the Rova of Antananarivo, the lamba-wrapped remains of only one sovereign—Ranavalona III—could be saved from the flames. The queen has since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

Amongst the events documented is perhaps the first recorded worker's strike, detailed in the Turin strike papyrus.|$|E
5|$|There are 35 royal tombs and 155 tumuli {{in central}} Gyeongju, and 421 tumuli in the {{outskirts}} of the city. Silla burial mounds built after the period of the Three Kingdoms are found in central Gyeongju, including tumuli in the districts of Noseo-dong, Nodong-dong, Hwangnam-dong, Hwango-dong and Inwang-dong. Western Gyeongju has the tomb of King Muyeol in Seoak-dong, nearby tumuli in Chunghyo-dong and the tomb of Kim Yu-sin. <b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> of Queen Seondeok, King Sinmun, King Hyogong and King Sinmu are at the base of Namsan mountain while <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> of King Heongang, King Jeonggang, King Gyeongmyeong and King Gyeongae are on the slopes of the mountain.

50|$|Imam Abdullah Tomb - This cube-shaped tomb lies {{west of the}} new {{bridge in}} Hasankeyf and is <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of Imam Abdullah.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tomb,</b> {{located in}} Hunei District, Kaohsiung City, was {{discovered}} in 1937.

Although <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was empty, <b>the</b> villagers built a square concrete wall around <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> site to demarcate it. After World War II, the residents of Zhuhu and Hunei funded <b>the</b> <b>tomb's</b> rebuilding, and <b>the</b> decoy <b>tombs</b> were dismantled and assembled into a large <b>tomb.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> site you can see today is a reconstruction done by the Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City) government in 1977, and in 1988 it was designated a third class historic site.|$|R

5|$|Arha's {{childhood}} and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She {{is trained in}} her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and the labyrinth beneath <b>the</b> <b>Tombs,</b> teaching her the instructions to find her way around them. She tells of the treasure hidden within the labyrinth, which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal in past years. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in <b>the</b> <b>Tombs.</b> She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to <b>the</b> <b>Tombs</b> by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she has them killed by starvation, an act which haunts {{her for a long}} time. After Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha and sees the Nameless Ones as a threat to her power.|$|E
5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to <b>the</b> <b>Tombs</b> looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in <b>the</b> <b>tombs,</b> bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of <b>the</b> <b>Tombs.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Medina holds <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> of {{the seven}} patron saints of Morocco, which are visited every year by pilgrims during the week-long ziara pilgrimage.

Circumambulation of <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> is undertaken by devotees to achieve inner purity. This ritual is performed on Fridays in the following ordained sequence: Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali Sanhaji, Sidi al-Qadi Iyyad al-Yahsubi, Sidi Bel Abbas, Sidi Mohamed ibn Sulayman al-Jazouli, Sidi Abdellaziz Tabba'a, Sidi Abdellah al-Ghazwani, and lastly, Sidi Abderrahman al-Suhayli.

5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of <b>the</b> <b>Tombs,</b> and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of <b>the</b> <b>Tombs,</b> which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of <b>the</b> <b>Tombs.</b> Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E
