40|$|The role of {{national}} parliaments in scrutinising their governments <b>in</b> European <b>Union</b> <b>affairs</b> {{has been at}} the forefront of debates on democratic accountability <b>in</b> the European <b>Union</b> for the past two decades. Resolutions are the legislative instruments most clearly associated with government control. This article finds that party political strategies, and especially the different constraints and incentives for mainstream/government parties and issue entrepreneurs on Europe, are the most important factors determining the activity {{of national}} parliaments in the form of resolutions on European <b>Union</b> <b>affairs.</b> Issue entrepreneurs are parties which are Eurosceptic and for which Europe is salient. Motions initiated by issue entrepreneurs are numerous but limited to criticising the government and contain little technical detail, while the resolutions of mainstream government parties mostly support the government’s position. Resolutions and motions <b>in</b> European <b>Union</b> <b>affairs</b> are thus used rather as instruments of ‘position taking’ than as a form of government control, but could still help to foster accountability by bringing European Union issues and government policy to the citizens’ attention...|$|R

While the TUUL unions suffered major defeats and had difficulties in organizing in the heavy and mass production industries such as mining, textile, maritime and steel, these unions experienced considerable organizing success in light industries in New York City, particularly after the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933.
