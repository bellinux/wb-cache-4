5|$|Folk {{music in}} the US is varied across the country's {{numerous}} ethnic groups. The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music, most of it spiritual in nature. African American music includes blues and gospel, descendants of West African music brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> by slaves and mixed with Western European music. During the colonial era, English, French and Spanish styles and instruments were brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas.</b> By the early 20th century, the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world, including polka, Ukrainian and Polish fiddling, Ashkenazi, klezmer, and several kinds of Latin music.|$|E
5|$|Honey {{bees are}} not native <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas,</b> {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other {{regions in the}} Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations—where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century {{epizootics}} in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences. Bluetongue disease, a disease caused by an orbivirus broke out in sheep in France in 2007. Until then the disease had been mainly confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas,</b> Africa, southern Asia and northern Australia, but it is now an emerging disease around the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that cricket was introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> and India before it had spread throughout the British Isles. For example, {{there is no record}} of cricket in Yorkshire, home of the English game's most successful club, until 1751. The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century.|$|E

It was finally demolished in 1926 when the Royal Edward Dock was expanded.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats are bats whose {{food source}} is blood, a dietary trait called hematophagy. Three bat species feed solely on blood: the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi). All three species are native <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas,</b> ranging from Mexico to Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina.|$|E

5|$|In 1513 the Kaqchikel {{suffered}} from a plague of locusts. The following year, in 1514, Iximche was severely damaged by a fire. A plague, described as terrible in the Annals of the Kaqchikel, struck the city in 1519 and lasted two years, resulting in {{a large number of}} deaths. This was likely to have been smallpox brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> with the Spanish. After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish onslaught in 1521, the Kaqchikel sent messengers to Hernán Cortés offering an alliance with the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the harbour was {{the setting}} for the first International Festival of the Sea. A larger version of the annual harbour festivals, this was {{attended}} by many tall ships, including the Eye of the Wind, Pride of Baltimore, Rose, Kaskelot and Earl of Pembroke. The key theme was John Cabot's pioneering voyage of discovery <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> and a replica of Cabot's ship, the Matthew, was dedicated prior to its reenactment of Cabot's voyage the following year. In 2009, the 200th anniversary of the Floating Harbour was commemorated {{with a series of}} celebratory events.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus. After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and turnips, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jacques Cartier {{first brought}} cabbage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> in 1541–42, {{and it was}} {{probably}} planted by the early English colonists, {{despite the lack of}} written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century. By the 18th century, it was commonly planted by both colonists and native American Indians. Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet, and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island. It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> by European colonists. It {{is unclear how}} many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E

5|$|The Banker {{horse is}} a breed of feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) living on barrier islands in North Carolina's Outer Banks. It is small, hardy, {{and has a}} docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and {{possibly}} brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock may have become feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands {{by one of the}} exploratory expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville.

5|$|The Spanish {{probably}} obtained spotted horses through {{trade with}} southern Austria and Hungary, where the color pattern {{was known to}} exist. The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> when they first arrived in the early 16th century. One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought to Mexico by Cortez, and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604. Others arrived {{in the western hemisphere}} when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th-century Europe, and were shipped to Mexico, California and Oregon.|$|E

This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100m (109yd) of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{from near}} Santa Fé {{included}} the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin {{as it had}} been previously thought that horses had only come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas</b> in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon tooth and a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of the horse.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar (Panthera onca) {{is a big}} cat, a feline in the Panthera genus, and is {{the only}} extant Panthera species native <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americas.</b> The jaguar is the third-largest feline species after the tiger and the lion, and the largest in the Americas. The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and {{northern}} Argentina.
