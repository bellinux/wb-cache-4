25|$|This great {{emphasis}} on the performativity of tomb figurines {{could be related to}} the competitive Tang culture of publicly displaying one’s wealth and power. The social classes of Tang society were mobile. This means <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different social classes could improve its status through hard work and move to an upper class. This created a competitive society, where people often showed off their wealth and power. Members of prominent families or high-ranking officials often paraded through streets in the public, with troops of servants mounted on beautiful horses. This culture of public display takes place even during funerals. After the funerary ceremonies at home are complete, there would be a funeral procession to transport the deceased from home to gravesite.|$|E

Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With strategy games, players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.|$|E

500|$|It was Máel Coluim III, not {{his father}} Donnchad, who did more {{to create the}} dynasty that ruled Scotland for the {{following}} two centuries.

However, despite having a royal Anglo-Saxon wife, Máel Coluim spent much of his reign conducting slave raids against the English, adding to the woes of <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England and the Harrying of the North.

He added that in humorous, sexually-oriented cartoons, there is a [...] "fine line" [...] between [...] "cute and funny" [...] and [...] "repulsive". He wanted to design the relationship between the Queen and Jill in a way <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BDSM community could identify with it, while also avoiding putting people off who were not into BDSM. He used European comics as a model for his art work, which he admired for the [...] "permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons".
