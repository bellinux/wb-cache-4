40|$|Based on the TRLO [1] {{firmware}} for the VULOM [2], {{an enhanced}} digital trigger and experiment control {{has been developed}} and tested at the LAND/R 3 B setup. The complete new system debuted late summer last year in about six weeks of production experiments operating reliably. Trigger functionality The original TRLO firmware replaces the trigger chain of logic matrix, <b>trigger</b> <b>box,</b> priority encoder, pattern unit and scalers. The new development retains this functionality, but reorganized to operate the entire FPGA with one 10 ns clock period instead of 2. 5 ns for the trigger decisions. This delays the timing-critical master start signal by about 20 ns, becoming just comparable to the NIM-based LAND trigger, at 55 ns from detector trigger input to delivered master start. Saving resources, the revision also allow...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. LXI, {{which is}} {{generally}} recognized as {{the new generation of}} instrument bus technology, not only has developed rapidly in the field of test and measurement, but also has a vast potential for future development. At present, the LXI trigger requires the clock synchronization precision to reach a sub microsecond level or even higher one. Therefore, in order to meet this accuracy requirement, a scheme based on the embedded Linux and IEEE 1588 protocol is proposed in this paper on the basis of studying LXI so as to realize high accurate clock synchronization. This scheme acquires hardware timestamp by utilizing PHY chip DP 83640 and realizes PTP hardware clock driving based on Linux. A synchronization test with Agilent B LXI <b>trigger</b> <b>box</b> under the current condition is conducted and about 100 ns of synchronization precision can be reached when connected with cable directly. The result demonstrates the feasibility of the scheme and that the clock synchronization precision can reach a nanosecond level. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a superhydrophobic {{surface and}} its {{relation}} to the enhancement of the droplet fluid dynamics {{to the surface of the}} object materials was investigated. As the comparison, hydrophilic and uncoated surface of an object also investigated. The investigations used height of impact at 89 mm. The high quality speed camera is employed to investigate the droplet dynamic on a copper foil and a calcium fluoride surfaces. Both of the materials are coated with superhydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces separately. The droplet diameter was analyzed using the program PHANTOM. The droplet contact angle was analyzed by the Goniometry method. The water was dropped on the calcium fluoride and the copper foil using a syringe (sharp tip) with initial droplet diameter of 1. 9 mm. To record the droplet fluid shape, the photo micro sensor was placed inside the <b>trigger</b> <b>box</b> below the syringe. The results showed that the superhydrophobic surface both on copper foil and calcium fluoride enhanced the mobility of a droplet compared to the hydrophilic and the uncoated surfaces. The results showed that the maximum droplet diameter on the copper foil coated by the superhydrophobic, the hydrophilic and the uncoated surfaces are 4. 7, 5. 0, 5. 2 mm, respectively; and for the calcium fluoride are 4. 5, 5. 1 and 5. 5 mm, respectively. Meanwhile, the results for the droplet contact angle on the copper foil coated by the superhydrophobic, the hydrophilic and the uncoated surfaces are 20 °, 90 °, 160 °, respectively; and for the calcium fluoride are 25 °, 95 °, 165 °, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The fast on-orbit {{recording}} of transient events satellite (FORTE) will carry a multiple-narrow-band trigger designed to detect impulsive VHF signals {{embedded in a}} high-noise background. The FORTE <b>trigger</b> <b>boxes</b> consist of eight VHF channels spaced across twenty MHz of bandwidth. A trigger is generated when a sufficiently bright signal is seen in a user-defined number of these channels within a specified coincidence window. In addition, the trigger circuitry incorporates a feature to reject events caused by the actuation of narrow-band carriers. This report describes the trigger`s operating principles and their implementation in the satellite hardware.

40|$|Embedding complex {{sinusoidal}} {{patterns on}} the wall surfaces of box beam impact absorbers has been recently proposed in literature and demonstrated to significantly improve energy absorption capability of box beams during axial impacts. However, no suitable trigger has yet been devised for these absorbers. This paper evaluates the viability of using conventional notch triggers on patterned beams. A progressive <b>triggering</b> mechanism on <b>box</b> beams with embedded patterns is also proposed by a novel idea of using a variable pattern throughout {{the length of the}} beam. In the proposed progressively triggered beams, the reaction force slightly increases with each progressive collapse buckle formation throughout the collapse. An extensive FEM study is performed using the commercial pre-processor HyperCrash™ and the commercial explicit FEM solver RADIOSS™. It is found that, as opposed to point triggers, progressive triggering through variable pattern formulation effectively triggers and initiates a more stable collapse. More importantly, progressive triggers cause less stray deformations elsewhere along the beam and are consequently much more robust against global bending...|$|R
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (EM) emission {{associated with}} a gravitational wave (GW) signal {{is one of the}} main goal of future astronomy. Merger of neutron stars and/or black holes and core-collapse of massive stars are expected to cause rapid transient electromagnetic signals. The EM follow-up of GW signals will have to deal with large position uncertainties. The gravitational sky localization is expected to be tens to hundreds of square degrees. Wide-field cameras and rapid follow-up observations will be crucial to characterize the EM candidates for the first EM counterpart identification. We present some of the activities that we are currently carrying on to optimize the response of the INAF network of facilities to expected GW triggers.

50|$|The Analog Protection System (APS), {{also known}} as Copyguard, is a DVD copy {{prevention}} system originally developed by Macrovision. Video tapes copied from DVDs encoded with APS become garbled and unwatchable. The process works by adding pulses to analog video signals to negatively impact the AGC circuit of a recording device. In digital devices changes to the analog video signal are created by a chip that converts the digital video to analog within the device.

50|$|According to {{the already}} cited authors Alfred Chapuis & Édouard Gélis, three {{manufacturers}} were active in Geneva in 1928: F. Cattelin, Marguerat and A. Salmon. C. H. Marguerat - Manufacture d'Oiseaux Chantant, Avenue de la Gare des Eux Vives 18, Genève - is {{the best known of}} the three, though their movements are not always marked. Charles-Armand Marguerat (1887-1931) is noted for rectangular boxes with a small round timepiece mounted on two pillars above the box. The clock mechanism can be set to <b>trigger</b> the bird <b>box</b> {{in the same way as}} an alarm, or the box may be played independently. Other Marguerat's boxes are very often oval in shape, but use a conventional movement trimmed off at the corners. The movement employed is very similar to Bontems', but - as with Flajoulot - the governor for speed control is a departure and might have derived from Flajoulot's design. In general, Marguerat mechanisms were well made and particularly the enamelled cases are of very good quality for the epoch.|$|R
5000|$|... "Delay Box" [...] is {{a common}} slang term used in drag racing to {{describe}} an on-board timer which is a Transmission Brake Delay Timer. A transbrake forces the race car to remain stationary at the starting line, in gear, regardless of how much engine power is applied. When the visual signal is given to start the race, the driver <b>triggers</b> the delay <b>box</b> to begin timing (precisely counting down). If the driver does not interrupt this timing device, the car is launched down the race track at the instant the timer expires (counts to zero). Delay box use was very controversial in the 1980s and 1990s, as it removed {{a portion of the}} advantages more experienced racers had. There was a period where technologists added and concealed homemade circuitry inside a delay box that violated some racing associations rules. Racing associations have imposed strict limits on delay boxes today, with manufacturers having to submit to an approval process, which has drastically reduced the number of makers of these devices.|$|R
40|$|Myc {{oncogene}} is a {{transcription factor}} {{that contributes to}} the genesis {{of a wide variety of}} tumors by regulating proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Despite being one of the first isolated oncogene, the biochemical mechanisms of Myc mediated transcriptional regulation remain unclear. Myc has been found to govern different aspects of gene expression, from chromatin remodeling to basal transcription and processive RNAPII elongation. Myc binding to targets genes depends on the presence of the E-box binding motif and the presence of histone H 3 K 4 me 3 lysines. Here, we summarize recent findings regarding the function of Myc in orchestrating different steps in transcription, and we propose a model that links histone H 3 methylation code to Myc target genes. Myc upon binding to the E <b>box</b> <b>triggers</b> a series of events that assembles the transcription initiation complex, recruits the demethylating enzyme LSD 1, induces DNA oxidation and chromating looping.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a heat switch for autonomous temperature control of electronic components in a satellite. A heat switch can modulate when needed between roles of a good thermal conductor and a good thermal insulator. Electronic boxes on a satellite should be maintained within a typical optimum temperature range of 260 to 310 K. The heat sinking is usually by means of a radiator. When the operating temperature of the electronic box increases beyond 310 K, a good contact to the radiator is desired for maximum cooling. On the other hand, when the satellite is in a cold dormant state, the electronics box should be heated by the onboard batteries. In this state a weak thermal contact is desired between the electronic box and the heat sink. In the present study, we are developing a gas gap heat switch in which the sorber material is thermally anchored to the electronic box. A temperature change of the electronic <b>box</b> <b>triggers</b> the (de-) sorption of gas from the sorber material and subsequently the gas pressure in the gas gap.

This was followed by bottom water with salinity between 34 and 35, and then a salinity minimum (30 - 34). Radiocarbon ages for foraminifera and pelecypods indicate that the deglacial stage began before 14 ka BP and ended approximately 13. 5 ka BP; the salinity minimum began about 12. 1 ka BP in the Laurentian Channel. Benthonic foraminiferal zones show that {{the temperature}} of the bottom water in Chaleur Trough has remained close to 0 ∘C since deglaciation.
