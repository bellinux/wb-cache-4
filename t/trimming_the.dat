5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E
5|$|In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr {{sits on a}} barrow, {{plaiting}} golden collars for {{his female}} dogs, and <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the elves; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr {{says that he has}} hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started to {{assemble}} a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an improbable challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored the all-important second goal.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for <b>trimming.</b> <b>The</b> number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed {{by the total number of}} fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E
5|$|The bank bailouts and the {{economic}} downturn increased the country's deficit and debt levels {{and led to a}} substantial downgrading of its credit rating. To build up trust in the financial markets, the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution to require a balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020. The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession or other emergencies. As one of the largest eurozone economies (larger than Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined) the condition of Spain's economy is of particular concern to international observers. Under pressure from the United States, the IMF, other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to an 7.1% in 2013.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

25|$|Auxins promote root initiation. Auxin induces both {{growth of}} {{pre-existing}} roots and adventitious root formation, i.e., branching of the roots. As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall {{development of the}} roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.|$|E

25|$|The {{winter of}} 1890–1891 was mild, so Murtaja could not {{demonstrate}} her icebreaking capabilities to their full extent. However, she lost {{a large number}} of cast iron propeller blades and while the replacement blades could be installed at sea by <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> vessel so that the propeller shaft was near the water surface, the heavy task took several days. For this reason the Helsinki Polytechnics later developed more durable steel blades that were also used in the subsequent icebreakers.|$|E
25|$|The weaver needs {{a number}} of {{essential}} tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; {{and a pair of}} shears for <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> pile after a row of knots, or a small number of rows, have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn after each row of knots is completed.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{hockey and}} its various {{precursor}} games utilized balls {{until the late}} 19th century. By the 1870s, 'flat' pucks were made of wood as well as rubber. At first, pucks were square. The first recorded organized game of ice hockey used a wooden puck {{to prevent it from}} leaving the rink of play. The rubber pucks were first made by slicing a rubber ball, then <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> disc square. The Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal is credited with making and using the first round pucks in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} Pan Am had racked up $364million of {{accumulated}} losses over a 10-year period, and its debts approached $1billion. This threatened the airline with bankruptcy. Former American Airlines {{vice president of}} operations, William T. Seawell, who had replaced Najeeb Halaby as Pan Am president in 1972, began implementing a turnaround strategy: <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> network by 25%, slashing the 40,000-strong workforce by 30% and cutting wages, introducing stringent economies and rescheduling debt, and reducing {{the size of the}} fleet. These measures aided by the use of tax-loss credits enabled Pan Am to avert financial collapse and return to profitability in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{specialised}} cornified {{structures of}} the hoof are the wall, the sole, the frog and periople. The wall does not exfoliate at all; it is constantly growing downward (about 1cm per month), and self-trims by wearing or chipping by ground contact, in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by ground contact and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and typical ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> walls and the frog, and scraping off the dead sole.|$|E
25|$|On Christmas Day 2012, the Knicks wore {{monochrome}} uniforms {{known as}} 'Big Color'. The uniforms are mostly orange, with blue <b>trimming.</b> <b>The</b> following year, the Knicks wore sleeved orange uniforms known as 'Big Logo', featuring a chrome-treated Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore {{a variation of}} their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player's first name in a blue nameplate below the number. The 2016 Christmas Day game against the Celtics saw the Knicks wear an all-blue uniform without additional striping, complete with fancy scripted orange lettering and numbers.|$|E
