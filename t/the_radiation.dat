5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through <b>the</b> <b>radiation</b> belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as <b>the</b> <b>radiation</b> had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with <b>the</b> <b>radiation</b> levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. <b>The</b> <b>radiation</b> also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>radiation</b> sources can be {{precisely}} positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy {{enables a}} high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because <b>the</b> <b>radiation</b> sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>radiation</b> sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity â€“ i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{level of}} the UV-B irradiation due to depleting {{of the ozone layer}} is considered {{to be one of the}} causes of global amphibian declines. <b>The</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> causes damage to the DNA in the nuclei of the skin cells and their eventual death. In many amphibian species there was found a negative influence of <b>the</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> on <b>the</b> hatching success of tadpoles and their subsequent viability.

The measurements were performed for two groups of tadpoles differing in age to determine whether the level of development may affect the tadpoles' preference to <b>the</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> <b>The</b> tadpoles in both groups spent more time in the zone without <b>the</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> <b>The</b> tadpoles in the more advanced development phase have spent 7 times more time in average in the zone without <b>the</b> UV <b>radiation</b> than in <b>the</b> zone with it. The tadpoles from the second group have spent in average 2. 5 times more time in the zone without <b>the</b> UV <b>radiation</b> than in <b>the</b> zone with <b>the</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> <b>The</b> total swimming path length of advanced tadpoles was almost 2. 5 times longer in the zone without <b>the</b> UV <b>radiation</b> than in <b>the</b> zone with <b>the</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> Conversely, <b>the</b> total path length of younger tadpoles did not significantly differ between the zones.
