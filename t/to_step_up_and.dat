5|$|Coming {{into his}} sophomore season, Stastny {{admitted}} the pressure would increase during the year. He continued the strong finish of his rookie year, by scoring his first career hat-trick against Marty Turco of the Dallas Stars in the season's first game and scoring five {{points for the}} first time four days later, against the San Jose Sharks. He scored 15 goals and had 28 assists in his first 34 games of the season, and had his 100th NHL point in his 99th NHL game. At the same time, Stastny hit a slump, during which he had one point in eight games. With the Avalanche having lost top players Joe Sakic and Ryan Smyth to injuries, Ryan Kennedy of The Hockey News pointed to Stastny's inconsistency and wrote it was time for Stastny <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> be a leader in all aspects. Despite being on the longest scoreless streak of his career, which lasted 10games, on January 11, 2008, the NHL announced Stastny would play at the 56th National Hockey League All-Star Game. He scored two goals and three assists in three games before the Colorado Avalanche announced six days later that Stastny would miss approximately 2–3 weeks, including his first All-Star Game to have his appendix removed. After recovering from the surgery and returning to skating, he suffered a groin injury during a practice, delaying his return. Stastny ended up missing 15 games, but he scored a goal on his comeback against the Phoenix Coyotes on February 22. He scored seven goals and had 15 assists {{until the end of the}} regular season, missing a game due to flu on March 20. With 71 points scored, he finished the regular season as the team's scoring leader and the Avalanche finished 6th in the West, progressing to the playoffs to play against the Minnesota Wild. Stastny failed to score a point until the fifth game, when his game-winning goal gave the Avalanche the lead in the series. Colorado ended the series by winning the sixth game and progressed to meet the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Semifinals. Stastny scored a goal and an assist in the first game of the series, but a depleted Avalanche team was swept in four games. Stastny missed the last game of the series after he injured his knee during the first period of the third game.|$|E

25|$|Both {{teams were}} tied 17-17 {{going into the}} final decisive baker system game - at one point Team Europe led by over 30 pins, with Mack and Hoffman failing to strike. The game became close (11 pins) {{and then in the}} 9th frame Tore Torgersen left a {{difficult}} split and missed, giving Tommy Jones the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> seal the victory for the Americans, and he duly obliged.|$|E

25|$|The 2011 season started {{well for}} the Sun. Few changes {{were made in the}} off-season, which gave the team some {{consistency}} and a year of experience on which to build. Sandrine Gruda and Anete Jēkabsone-Žogota decided to sit out the season, so the Sun looked elsewhere, adding Jessica Moore and relying on rookie Danielle McCray <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> score. In a tough Eastern Conference, the Sun held a 9–5 record going into the All-Star break.|$|E
25|$|Peter's most {{impressive}} match was probably at the Thomas Cup Finals where Denmark was facing Indonesia for {{a ticket to}} play China in the finals. Denmark took the first two Men's Doubles matches, but Peter Gade crumpled {{under the pressure of}} Indo first singles player Sony Dwi Kuncoro. Kenneth Jonassen followed suit by losing to future Olympic Gold and World Champion Taufik Hidayat. So the spotlight was again on Peter Rasmussen <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> step up he did. He beat the youngster from Indonesia, Simon Santoso in front of 12,000 screaming Indonesian fans in straight sets, 15-3, 15-12.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} {{of men and}} women meant that women were forced to wait long periods to have children and get married. This lengthened the timeline of independence for single women and impacted the Japanese-Canadian community after internment by creating more independent women, both of which disrupted the pre-internment way of life. Young children were forced <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> take on more responsibilities when fathers were taken away. Accounts from children in internment camps recall the impact not having a father. One girl recalls how her sister went from being a pampered eldest child to being a head of household in their father's absence. This was disruptive to the typical family structure because not only was a child in charge, but it was a girl. Transitions such as these gave women a much greater power within the family structure and gave children more adult responsibilities.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the game, Penn State was {{predicted}} {{to have the}} advantage {{on both sides of}} the ball at every position, [...] and as such, was expected to win handily. Coming into the game, Penn State had sustained injuries two of their top tight ends, Matt Lehman and Kyle Carter. Lehman suffered a knee injury against Syracuse and was out for the season, while Carter was [...] "day-to-day" [...] with an arm injury, but played in the game. The Lions wanted to focus on improving their running game, which was lackluster against Syracuse; Eastern Michigan allowed 202 rushing yards on 5.8 yards per carry in week one. Defensively, linebacker depth was an issue for the Lions. Safety Stephen Obeng-Agyapong was expected <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> take snaps at linebacker, in addition to speculation he could end up on offense. At half time, the Nittany Lions honored the 1973 Penn State Nittany Lions football team and retired the number of Penn State's only Heisman Trophy winner, number 22 John Cappelletti.|$|E
500|$|Lukather is the {{original}} lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, {{as well as a}} lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. He contributed songwriting to Toto albums starting with the eponymous lead track on 1979's Hydra. Miles Davis was featured on the song [...] "Don't Stop Me Now", the last track of 1986's Fahrenheit album. After the session, he invited Lukather to join his band, but Lukather was committed already to the upcoming Toto tour. [...] In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role.|$|E
500|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace {{offers a}} mix of both {{electric}} and acoustic songs, which Grohl likened to the band growing older and [...] "comfortable {{with all kinds of}} music" [...] instead of just focusing on straight rock songs, saying that listening to the album he felt like [...] "we've gotten over our insecurities, because it presents us {{in a way that we}} probably hid in the past." [...] Grohl also stated that [...] "the idea now is <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> make [...] Odessey and Oracle" [...] - [...] the album he claimed to have listened the most during production - and that [...] "it has always been my dream to mix Steely Dan with Nomeansno." [...] Amidst the amount of heavier tracks and themes Grohl decided to include the song [...] "Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)", described as [...] "the most light-hearted, melodic song of all" [...] which [...] "seemed like a little ray of hope in the middle of all this despair." [...] Grohl added that there was a bigger focus on melodies even in heavier tracks such as [...] "The Pretender", [...] "Let It Die" [...] and [...] "Erase/Replace", and that album closer [...] "Home", a ballad featuring Grohl on the piano, was [...] "the best song I've ever written".|$|E

Further, cars have been banned from approaching airport terminals and are instead directed to outlying car parks and passengers bussed in.|$|R

500|$|Mike Adams, the {{producer}} of Murder on the Orient Express, was extremely determined to have David Suchet as the voice actor for Poirot, a major character in the game. Nixon thought that Suchet had become so intertwined with the character of Poirot, after his success with the television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, {{that it would be}} hard to imagine someone else doing Poirot's voice without constantly being compared to Suchet. Nixon described the situation as a catch-22, saying that he [...] "worried about someone coming in and doing a Suchet impression instead of a unique rendition of Poirot, yet the more the voice strays from Suchet's version, the more people will wish it was Suchet doing it!" [...] Another reason for the development team's determination to have Suchet aboard was that they thought he would spur the other voice actors in the game, such as Vanessa Marshall who portrayed Antoinette Marceau, <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> compete with Suchet's skillful portrayal of Poirot. Fairly late in the game's development, Suchet agreed to do the voice acting. He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long. Adams expressed pride at having succeeded in convincing Suchet to do voice acting for Murder on the Orient Express, and said that his skillful voice acting would bring [...] "tremendous excitement and authenticity" [...] to the game.|$|E

2500|$|Su Ze {{was still}} the Administrator of Jincheng Commandery when he first heard that the Cao Wei state had {{replaced}} the Eastern Han dynasty, and he thought that Emperor Xian was dead so he held {{a memorial service for}} the emperor. Later, he became awkwardly silent when he found out that Emperor Xian was alive and had been made the Duke of Shanyang (山陽公) after his abdication. Cao Zhi, a younger brother of Cao Pi, also shed tears when he heard of the fall of the Han dynasty. Cao Zhi's grief, however, was also partly because of the frustration he felt at losing to Cao Pi when they were fighting for the succession to their father's place. After Cao Pi became emperor, he was surprised to learn that there were people who cried when they heard that Emperor Xian had abdicated the throne to him, so he asked his subjects why. At the point in time, Cao Pi already knew about Cao Zhi, but not about Su Ze, so his question was directed at Cao Zhi. Su Ze thought that Cao Pi was referring to him, so he prepared <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> respond. However, Fu Xun, another Palace Attendant, stopped him and said, [...] "(His Majesty) is not talking about you." [...] Su Ze then backed down.|$|E
