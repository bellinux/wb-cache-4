5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a variety of}} inner models exhibiting features usually obtained by forcing over universes with large cardinals. For example, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> supercompact cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a Laver indestructible supercompact cardinal. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> supercompact cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a supercompact cardinal κ for which 2 ^κ=κ^+, another for which 2 ^κ=κ^++ and another in which the least strongly compact cardinal <b>is</b> supercompact. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strongly compact cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a strongly compact cardinal, for which the measurable cardinals are bounded below it and another inner model W with a strongly compact cardinal κ, such that H_κ^+^V⊆ HOD^W. Similar facts hold for supercompact, measurable and strongly Ramsey cardinals. If <b>a</b> cardinal <b>is</b> supercompact up to a weakly iterable cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model of the Proper Forcing Axiom and another inner model with a supercompact cardinal in which GCH+V=HOD holds. Under the same hypothesis, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with level by level equivalence between strong compactness and supercompactness, and indeed, another in which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> level by level inequivalence between strong compactness and supercompactness. If <b>a</b> cardinal <b>is</b> strongly compact up to a weakly iterable cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model in which the least measurable cardinal is strongly compact. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> weakly iterable limit δ of <δ-supercompact cardinals, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a proper class of Laver-indestructible supercompact cardinals.
