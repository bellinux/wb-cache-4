5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of his victim, in close {{proximity}} to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic entomology, a villager was hacked to death with a sickle, which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which sickle was used as the murder weapon, the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E
5|$|The Shapes in Space segment {{focuses on}} visual and spatial awareness, with the {{presenter}} exploring shapes, colour and everyday {{materials such as}} boxes and playdough. Musicality is explored through Making Music, {{with an emphasis on}} pitch, rhythm, beat, melody, and using a variety of real and pretend instruments. The presenter of Body Move encourages children to participate in movement and dance, developing physical coordination and motor development. Linguistics and aural skills are at the centre of the Word Play segment, featuring a puppet named Chatterbox who assists in the exploration of language through stories and rhymes. Puzzles and Patterns has a focus on logical thinking and mathematics, with a puppet named Jup Jup used as a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presenter to complete puzzles or solve problems.|$|E

This equipment includes flashlights, signal mirrors, tactical vests, safety vests, and food that will last them at least 24hours. The equipment carried by ground teams varies much by the mission at hand. Urban direction finding (UDF) missions necessitate only a small kit of gear. But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties.

5|$|The {{incident}} received significant {{media coverage}} in Norway, and Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted multiple cover stories to investigating the controversy. The media faced criticism for its extensive coverage of Ballo's death. Norway parliament member Inga Marte Thorkildsen commented {{that she thought}} indications were that Scientology {{had a role in}} Ballo's suicide. Psychologist Rudy Myrvang told Aftenposten that the Scientology personality test was designed to break down an individual; he characterized the test as a form of recruitment <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> organization. Scientology critic Andreas Heldal-Lund stated parents of those involved in Scientology contacted him with similar concerns. The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.|$|E
5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see themselves and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of experiencing the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is a valuable <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to reach escape velocity was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, Venera 1 {{became the first}} planetary probe. It revealed {{the presence of the}} solar wind and performed the first fly-by of the planet Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the Mariner 2 fly-by of Venus in 1962. The first {{spacecraft to}} perform a fly-by of Mars was Mariner 4, which reached the planet in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth. In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E
