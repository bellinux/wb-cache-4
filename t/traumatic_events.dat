5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children. It demonstrated that little was being done to address the fears and concerns of victims of <b>traumatic</b> <b>events.</b> As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these <b>traumatic</b> <b>events.</b> Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E

40|$|Many people {{experience}} a potentially <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> during their lives, which {{can result in}} brief periods of post-traumatic stress symptoms; this is a normal reaction. Most people can deal with a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> when supported by significant others, but 10 % of them develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The nature of the <b>traumatic</b> <b>event,</b> the duration of exposure and {{the age at which}} one experiences such an event partly determine whether a person will develop PTSD. Psychological debriefing (a single-session consultation) does not prevent the development of PTSD; it is therefore not useful to offer this to everyone who has experienced a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event.</b> New and promising developments have, however, arisen in this regard. Trauma-focused psychotherapy has proved to be effective for patients with PTSD, possibly in combination with medication. Individuals who experience many or severe initial symptoms after a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> may benefit from early, short-term, trauma-focused psychotherapy for preventing the development of chronic PTSD. Developments pertaining to the DSM- 5 pay more attention to 'complex' PTSD, a type which is often the result of long-term traumatisation during childhoo...|$|R
25|$|<b>Traumatic</b> <b>events</b> {{are more}} subjective. What is {{traumatic}} {{is dependent on}} what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them. An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones.|$|E

25|$|Some {{clinical}} psychologists may {{focus on}} the clinical management of patients with brain injury—this area is known as clinical neuropsychology.

25|$|Situation-specific amnesia {{can arise}} {{in a variety}} of {{circumstances}} (for example, committing an offence, child sexual abuse) resulting in PTSD. It has been claimed that it involves a narrowing of consciousness with attention focused on central perceptual details and/or that the emotional or <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> are processed differently from ordinary memories.|$|E
50|$|Stress {{and trauma}} {{can also cause}} create other {{problems}} in eyewitness testimonies such as repression. Repression influences eyewitness testimonies because if a child goes through a stressful or <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> they will sometimes repress their memories. According to Freud's theory on repression, a repressed memory is {{the memory of a}} <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> unconsciously retained in the mind, where it is said to adversely affect conscious thought, desire, and action. As a result, children will have trouble recalling this information or accessing it consciously. If a child who has witnessed a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> is used as an eyewitness, they may have a harder time recalling the event due to the possibility of memory repression.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in the interrelations among <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep problems. A wealth of research has examined the associations among these factors {{and there is an}} emerging literature focused on how sleep problems relate to both <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> exposure and PTSD across time. The current review provides a detailed analysis of studies pertaining to the temporal patterning of sleep problems and traumatic event-related factors (e. g., <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> exposure, PTSD) and draws conclusions regarding the current state of this literature. Research coalesces to suggest (1) exposure to a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> can interfere with sleep, (2) PTSD is related to the development of self-reported sleep problems, but evidence is less clear regarding objective indices of sleep, and (3) limited evidence suggests sleep problems may interfere with recovery from elevated posttraumatic stress levels. Future research now needs to focus on understanding mechanisms involved in these patterns to inform the prevention and treatment of comorbid sleep problems and PTSD.

25|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{an important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how people remember traumatic things.

25|$|The Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) {{is a free}} {{checklist}} {{designed for}} children and adolescents to report <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and symptoms that they might feel afterward. The items cover the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), specifically, the symptoms and clusters used in the DSM-IV. Although relatively new, {{there has been a}} fair amount of research on the CPSS due to the frequency of <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> involving children. The CPSS is usually administered to school children within school boundaries, or in an off-site location to assess symptoms of trauma. Some, but not all, people experience symptoms after a traumatic event, and in serious cases, these people may not get better on their own. Early and accurate identification, especially in children, of experiencing distress following a trauma could help with early interventions. The CPSS {{is one of a handful}} of promising measures that has accrued good evidence for reliability and validity, along with low cost, giving it good clinical utility as it addresses a public health need for better and larger scale assessment.|$|E
25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions. Most people will experience at least one traumatizing event in their lifetime. Men are more likely to experience a traumatic event, but women are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact traumatic event that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault.|$|E

25|$|The {{person may}} not {{remember}} what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see Repressed memory). This {{can lead to}} the <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like acute stress and anxiety disorder, traumatic grief, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorders, brief psychotic disorder, borderline personality disorder, adjustment disorder...etc.|$|E

50|$|Acute stress {{reaction}} (also called {{acute stress}} disorder, psychological shock, mental shock, or simply shock) is a psychological condition arising {{in response to}} a terrifying or <b>traumatic</b> <b>event,</b> or witnessing a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> that induces a strong emotional response within the individual. It {{should not be confused with}} the unrelated circulatory condition of shock/hypoperfusion. Acute stress reaction (ASR) may develop into delayed stress reaction (better known as PTSD) if stress is not correctly managed. ASR is characterized by re-living and avoiding reminders of an aversive event, as well as generalized hypervigilance after initial exposure to a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event.</b> ASD is differentiated from PTSD as a disorder that precedes it, and if symptoms last for more than one month, it will develop into PTSD. It can thus be thought of as the acute phase of PTSD.|$|R
