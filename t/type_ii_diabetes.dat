40|$|Pharmacological {{inhibition}} of liver GP (glycogen phosphorylase), {{which is currently}} being studied {{as a treatment for}} <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> (non-insulin-dependent) <b>diabetes,</b> may affect muscle glycogen metabolism. In the present study, we analysed the effects of the GP inhibitor CP- 91149 on non-engineered or GP-overexpressing cultured human muscle cells. We found that CP- 91149 treatment decreased muscle GP activity by (1) converting the phosphorylated AMP-independent a form into the dephosphorylated AMP-dependent b form and (2) inhibiting GP a activity and AMP-mediated GP b activation. Dephosphorylation of GP was exerted, irrespective of incubation of the cells with glucose, whereas {{inhibition of}} its activity was synergic with glucose. As expected, CP- 91149 impaired the glycogenolysis induced by glucose deprivation. CP- 91149 also promoted the dephosphorylation and activation of GS (glycogen synthase) in non-engineered or GP-overexpressing cultured human muscle cells, but exclusively in glucose-deprived cells. However, this inhibitor did not activate GS in glucose-deprived but glycogen-replete cells overexpressing PTG (protein targeting to glycogen), thus suggesting that glycogen inhibits the CP- 91149 -mediated activation of GS. Consistently, CP- 91149 promoted glycogen resynthesis, but not its overaccumulation. Hence, treatment with CP- 91149 impairs muscle glycogen breakdown, but enhances its recovery, which may be useful for the treatment of <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> (insulin-dependent) <b>diabetes...</b>|$|R

The predictors of outcome in such patients after coronary stenting have not been clarified. METHODS: We studied 133 consecutive patients with <b>type</b> <b>II,</b> insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> mellitus who underwent coronary stenting from November 1992 to May 2001. The clinical outcome and predictors of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; that is death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization) at follow-up were assessed. RESULTS: Out of 133 patients, 102 (76 %) had multivessel (> or = 2 vessels) disease. Eight patients (6. 0 %) had in-hospital MACE. Clinical follow-up data at 19. 5 months (range 6. 1 - 100 months) were available for 121 (91 %) patients. The MACE rate was 40. 5 %; 22 patients (18 %) died, 17 (14 %) of a cardiac death; 7 (5. 8 %) patients had a myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization was performed in 35 (28. 9 %) patients. At univariate analysis, hypertension (odds ratio-OR 5. 5; confidence interval-CI 2. 5 - 12. 3; p or = 15 mm) (OR 2. 7; CI 1. 5 - 4. 3; p = 0. 008) were related to MACE.

25|$|In animals, {{this is a}} rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} by which cells {{synthesize}} glucose from metabolic precursors.

25|$|Exercise is a {{particularly}} potent tool for glucose control in those who have diabetes mellitus.

In addition, {{there appears to be}} an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise.

However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with ketoacidosis.

2500|$|The {{structural}} and functional diversity of calpains {{in the cell}} is reflected in their involvement in the pathogenesis {{of a wide range}} of disorders. At least two well known genetic disorders and one form of cancer have been linked to tissue-specific calpains. When defective, the mammalian calpain 3 (also known as p94) is the gene product responsible for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A, calpain 10 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for <b>type</b> <b>II</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, and calpain 9 has been identified as a tumour suppressor for gastric cancer. Moreover, the hyperactivation of calpains is implicated in a number of pathologies associated with altered calcium homeostasis such as Alzheimer's disease, and cataract formation, as well as secondary degeneration resulting from acute cellular stress following myocardial ischemia, cerebral (neuronal) ischemia, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Excessive amounts of calpain can be activated due to Ca2+ influx after cerebrovascular accident (during the ischemic cascade) or some types of traumatic brain injury such as diffuse axonal injury. Increase in concentration of calcium in the cell results in calpain activation, which leads to unregulated proteolysis of both target and non-target proteins and consequent irreversible tissue damage. Excessively active calpain breaks down molecules in the cytoskeleton such as spectrin, microtubule subunits, microtubule-associated proteins, and neurofilaments.-dependent mechanisms of cell injury in cultured cortical neurons |journal=Neuroscience |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=1133–44 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9697120}} [...] It may also damage ion channels, other enzymes, cell adhesion molecules, and cell surface receptors. This can lead to degradation of the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. [...] Calpain may also break down sodium channels that have been damaged due to axonal stretch injury, leading to an influx of sodium into the cell. [...] This, in turn, leads to the neuron's depolarization and the influx of more Ca2+. A significant consequence of calpain activation is the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction that follows ischemic insult to the heart. Upon reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, there is development of calcium overload or excess in the heart cell (cardiomyocytes). This increase in calcium leads to activation of calpain.|$|E
