5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he {{had little choice but to}} present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E

5|$|In the NBA, Miller had {{a modest}} role {{for most of}} his first two seasons. He began to get regular playing time midway through his second season and in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of his second season he became an {{everyday}} starter due to injury. In 2016, he earned an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection and {{was a member of the}} 2015–16 ABA League champion, the 2015–16 Basketball League of Serbia champion and the 2016–17 Israeli Basketball State Cup winner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} 15-month probes, {{conducted}} by the U.S. Army inspector general's office and Seoul's Defense Ministry, interrogators interviewed or obtained statements from some 200 U.S. veterans and 75 Koreans. The Army researchers reviewed 1 million pages of U.S. archival documents. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> were marked by press reports from Seoul of sharp disputes between the U.S. and Korean teams. On January 11, 2001, the two governments issued their separate reports.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of Germany {{was put into}} effect on 1July 1945. Because of their unexpectedly rapid advances through central Germany in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war, British and American troops occupied large areas of territory that {{had been assigned to}} the Soviet zone of occupation. The redeployment of Western troops prompted many Germans to flee to the West to escape the Soviet takeover of the remainder of the Soviet zone.|$|E

On 30 November, the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros with the Entente powers, which concluded the conflict.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} training, No. 78 Squadron was {{deployed to}} the combat zone north of Australia in October 1943. From November that year until September 1944 the squadron supported {{the advance of}} the Allied ground forces through western New Britain and the north coast of New Guinea by attacking Japanese positions, providing fighter protection for recently established beachheads, and escorting Australian and United States bombers. From late 1944 until mid-1945 it operated against Japanese positions and shipping in the eastern Netherlands East Indies. The squadron {{took part in the}} Borneo campaign during <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war. No. 78 Squadron was reduced to a cadre after it returned to Australia in December 1945, but received new aircraft in 1946 and undertook training exercises until being disbanded in April 1948.|$|E
5|$|Following {{extensive}} repairs, she steamed for Korea {{again on}} 30 March 1953, and resumed operations {{a month later}} with her Corsairs embarked. Her missions around this time were generally strategic bombing missions, however {{the effectiveness of these}} final missions were mixed, with some failing to achieve strategic results. She also provided close air support for UN troops for <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war before an armistice was reached at Panmunjom in July 1953, ending major combat operations in Korea. During this time, the two sides often conducted costly attacks in order to strengthen their bargaining positions at the negotiating table. Boxer remained in Korean waters until November 1953. She received eight battle stars for her service in Korea.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the appeal}} of the Polish Four-Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army, and not seeing much {{opportunity}} to advance in his military career in the now-peaceful Saxony, on 28 June 1792 he joined the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of podpułkownik and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice-brigadier. Joining in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, he did not see combat in it. Unfamiliar with the intricasies of Polish politics, like many of Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792.|$|E
5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were {{a force to be reckoned}} with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a big surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E
5|$|In early March, Dreamer {{challenged}} the New Breed to a match at WrestleMania 23 {{on behalf of}} the Originals. The following week, Dreamer won a battle royal featuring members of the New Breed and the Originals. In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> leading up to WrestleMania, the stables continued to clash, with Van Dam defeating Burke on the March 27 episode of ECW. This provoked an attack on Van Dam by the other New Breed members, until the Originals made the save. At WrestleMania, the New Breed members lost to the ECW Originals in an eight-man tag team match, but on the following episode of ECW on Sci Fi, they defeated the ECW Originals in an extreme rules rematch.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> were {{a frantic}} rush to finish, {{with the band}} and {{production}} crew all suffering from exhaustion. Eno and Flood had minimal involvement with the final mixes, as they had other commitments. Facing understaffing, in late December, U2 hired Steve Lillywhite, producer of their first three albums, to remix the potential singles and make them more appealing to commercial radio. His eleventh-hour presence and changes caused discontent among the production crew, including Eno and Lanois. Lillywhite mixed four songs with engineer Mark Wallis on an SSL desk at Windmill Lane Studios. At the same time, Lanois, McCarthy, and Meegan mixed seven songs at Melbeach on a 24-track AMEK 2500 mixing desk; all three were required to operate the console {{due to the lack}} of mix automation.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the Football League was suspended indefinitely, leaving the club with no revenue. The Football League organised regional competitions after the government gave the Football Association permission for football to proceed on a wartime footing. York decided to carry on playing and were placed in the North East League, where they ranked eighth in their section of 11 clubs. In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of 1939–40, York competed in the Football League War Cup. The club was placed in the Football League North for 1940–41, and finished 32nd in the 36-club league. They beat Sheffield Wednesday 7–0 in the War Cup, before being eliminated by Newcastle United in the second round. After completing 18 fixtures in the 1941–42 Football League North, York competed in the league-organised qualifying stage of the War Cup. They were eliminated after ranking 33rd of 54 clubs, failing to qualify for the knock-out stages by one place. York played in the Combined Counties Cup in the season's closing weeks, and beat Halifax Town 5–4 over two legs in the final.|$|E
5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls {{with three or four}} knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E

5|$|Lützow and Admiral Scheer were {{deployed}} to Norway in 1942 {{to join the}} attacks on Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. Admiral Scheer conducted Operation Wunderland in August 1942, a sortie into the Kara Sea to attack Soviet merchant shipping, though it ended without significant success. Lützow participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942, a failed attempt to destroy a convoy. Both ships were damaged {{in the course of}} their deployment to Norway, and eventually returned to Germany for repairs. They ended their careers bombarding advancing Soviet forces on the Eastern Front; both ships were destroyed by British bombers in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war. Lützow was raised and sunk as a target by the Soviet Navy while Admiral Scheer was partially broken up in situ, with the remainder of the hulk buried beneath rubble.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2007, Brown {{was on the}} {{receiving}} end of a heavy tackle by Gilles Binya during Celtic's 1–0 win over Benfica, but he was relatively unhurt. Binya was subsequently given a six match European ban following the dangerous challenge. Celtic finished second in their Champions League group with nine points. They were drawn with Barcelona in the last 16, but Brown missed the 3–2 defeat in the first leg through suspension. He returned for the second leg at the Camp Nou, which Celtic lost 1–0. Brown was suspended for three league matches, including two Old Firm games, in April 2008. Due to this suspension, manager Gordon Strachan chose a midfield pairing of Barry Robson and Paul Hartley for <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season. Brown made a total of 48 appearances for Celtic in his first season with the club, scoring three goals.|$|E
5|$|Operation Sana, {{as well as}} Operation Maestral 2, {{were crucial}} in {{applying}} pressure on the VRS in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>weeks</b> of the Bosnian War. A Central Intelligence Agency analysis comparing the effects of Operation Deliberate Force, Sana and Maestral 2 on the VRS noted that the NATO campaign did not degrade the combat capability of the VRS as much as was initially assumed, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units, rather they targeted the command and control infrastructure of the Bosnian Serb military. The analysis concluded that, while NATO degraded {{the capabilities of the}} VRS, the final HV, HVO and ARBiH offensives inflicted the most damage. It further noted that those offensives, rather than the NATO bombing, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table and ending the war. Author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV, HVO and ARBiH would not have advanced as rapidly as they did had NATO not intervened and denied the VRS its long-range communications.|$|E
