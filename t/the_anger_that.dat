5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced this method of civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|In March 1896, the Matabele again rose {{up against}} the British South Africa Company {{administration}} in what became called the Second Matabele War or the First Chimurenga (liberation war). Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> led to this confrontation. The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill-fated Jameson Raid into the South African Republic (or Transvaal), {{and in the first}} few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Selous. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols. It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and the code of honor for the Boy Scouts.|$|E
25|$|Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is {{credited}} with fomenting much of <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> led to this confrontation. He convinced the Ndebele and Shona that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) {{were responsible for the}} drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time. Mlimo's call to battle was well timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the Jameson Raid. This left the country’s defences in disarray. The Ndebele began their revolt in March 1896, and in June 1896 they were joined by the Shona.|$|E

Speakers included Meera Syal, whose parents are from New Delhi. Speaking of <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> was expressed {{at the time of}} the rape, she said, [...] "We need to hold onto that anger and demand that the Indian Government enforces all the promised changes of its recent Criminal Law Amendment Act, which changed laws to expand the definition of rape and incorporated new offences including acid attack, sexual harassment, voyeurism and stalking". She also said that activists need to act in solidarity with other organisations to stop violence against women and girls around the world.|$|E
500|$|A billionaire socialite who dedicates {{himself to}} {{protecting}} Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante who is hailed as its [...] "Dark Knight" [...] at night. Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two rebellions against British {{authority}} {{took place}} in Barrackpore in the 19th century. The first of these was Barrackpore Mutiny of 1824, led by Sepoy Bindee Tiwary. In this rebellion, 47th Bengal Native Infantry refused to board boats to cross the sea for various reason including social taboo [...] "Kala pani (taboo)" [...] to Burma in the First Anglo-Burmese War. Consequently, British-manned artillery fired upon and [...] "erased" [...] them. In 1857, Barrackpore {{was the scene of}} an incident that some credit with starting the Indian rebellion of 1857: an Indian soldier, Mangal Pandey, attacked his British commander, and was subsequently court-martialed. His regiment was disbanded, an action which offended a number of sepoys and is considered to have contributed to <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> fueled the rebellion. In order to commemorate his sacrifice, a park named 'Sahid Mangal Pandey Udyan' was opened in the serenity of river Hoogly. The Army cantonment of Barrackpore also houses another significant historical landscape called the RCTC area, now populated by the defence quarters.|$|E
2500|$|Chad Childers of Loudwire {{stated that}} [...] "the album {{as a whole}} {{continues}} to expand their world-view writing like what listeners got with A Thousand Suns, but it also adds more of <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> was prevalent in their earliest work, Hybrid Theory." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic declared that [...] "there is definition to their structure, some of the choruses catch hold without too much effort -- but this album remains one of sustained mood, not individual moments" [...] and concludes that the album is [...] "a fitting soundtrack for aging rap-rockers who are comfortable in their skin but restless at heart". The Guardian writer Dave Simpson observed that [...] "Living Things is more personal than A Thousand Suns, with underlying themes of recovery from traumatic experiences. The exception, Burn It Down, delivers an antiwar sentiment via Depeche Mode-y electro-bounce, while the similarly standout Roads Untraveled is an eerie confessional ballad", and concluded that [...] "Living Things would have benefited from more of such adventure, but they still sound like a band enjoying an unexpected second life". Johan Wippsson of Melodic wrote that the album is [...] "too little too pop-oriented and made for the charts than before. The synthesizers are a bit too intent to Coldplay mode, but assume that the band felt {{it was time to}} conquer the charts again." [...] PopMatters' Jordan Blum concluded that “Living Things is a very good entry that’s simply not as special as its precursor." [...] Phil Mongredien from The Observer comments on their refusal to play it safe and praises their boldness.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2010 off-season, Miami {{acquired}} LeBron James {{from the}} Cleveland Cavaliers and Chris Bosh from the Toronto Raptors to {{team up with}} Wade and form their own [...] "big three" [...] (to rival the Celtics' big three) that was expected to win the championship. The Heat finished 58-24, acquiring the southeast division title and the second seed in the Eastern Conference. During the regular season, the Mavericks swept the Heat 2-0. The Heat cruised through the Playoffs without much competition, eliminating every team – the Philadelphia 76ers, defending Eastern Conference champions Boston Celtics and the top-seeded Chicago Bulls all five games. Meanwhile, the Mavericks had tallied 57-25 for the third seed, leaving them to face the Portland Trail Blazers {{in the first round}}. The Mavericks had been defeated in the first round all but one time since the 2006 finals, including a defeat from the seventh-seeded San Antonio Spurs just the previous season. Because of this, the Mavericks were underdogs throughout the playoffs, but they were able to dispatch Portland in six games. They faced the defending NBA champions Los Angeles Lakers and pulled off the impossible by sweeping them, ending their bid for a three-peat. In the conference finals, they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, resulting a rematch between the two teams. After taking a 2-1 lead however, the Heat stumbled in the next three games. They were eliminated on their own home floor after losing 95-105 during Game 6 in Miami – extending LeBron's quest for a ring. The loss had also brought further public humiliation for LeBron James, who had been scrutinized and negatively criticized for leaving the Cavaliers to join the Heat. LeBron was criticized for only averaging 17.8 points. Cavaliers fans rejoiced in the Heat's loss due <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> was caused by LeBron's decision to join the Heat, which they felt was unfair and a betrayal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incident}} {{involving a}} W-FIVE feature report in September 1979 {{was a turning}} point for Chinese in Canada in that it united the Chinese communities nationwide to fight anti-Chinese sentiments. The feature report stated that foreign Chinese were taking away Canadian citizens' opportunities for university educations. It suggested there were 100,000 students and featured a girl complaining that her high marks had not allowed her into the University of Toronto's pharmacy program because seats had been taken up by foreign students. The data used in the report, however, proved inaccurate. The Canadian Bureau for International Education revealed that there were only 55,000 foreign students in Canada at all levels of education, and only 20,000 full-time foreign university students. Historian Anthony B. Chan devoted an entire chapter of his 1983 book [...] "Gold Mountain" [...] to the incident, and found that contrary to the claims of the prospective pharmacy student, there were no foreign students in Toronto's program that year. Chan emphasized <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> the Chinese-Canadian community had about the images of anonymous Chinese people in the feature was because they felt the [...] "implication was that all students of Chinese origin were foreigners, and that Canadian taxpayers were subsidizing Chinese students — regardless of citizenship." [...] Chinese communities nationwide staged protests against Canadian Television (CTV), the network that airs W5. [...] Initially, CTV would only offer a [...] "statement of regret" [...] but the protests continued until an apology was made in 1980. Network executive Murray Chercover acknowledged the inaccuracy of {{a great deal of the}} program's information and added: [...] "We sincerely apologize for the fact Chinese-Canadians were depicted as foreigners, and for whatever distress this stereotyping may have caused them in the context of our multicultural society." [...] The protesters met in Toronto in 1980 and agreed to form the Chinese Canadian National Council to better represent Chinese Canadians on a national level.|$|E
