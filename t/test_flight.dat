5|$|On 24 December 1958, a BOAC Britannia 312 on a <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> crashed at Winkton, killing {{nine of the}} {{passengers}} and crew on board.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA891 {{was fitted}} with four Olympus 200 engines {{in the spring}} of 1958 for {{intensive}} flying trials. The aircraft crashed in July 1958 during a routine <b>test</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
25|$|The mated Enterprise/SCA {{combination}} {{was then}} subjected to five <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> with Enterprise unmanned and unactivated. The {{purpose of these}} <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> was to measure the flight characteristics of the mated combination. These tests were followed with three <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> with Enterprise manned to <b>test</b> the shuttle <b>flight</b> control systems.|$|R
2500|$|... SpaceShipTwo had {{conducted}} 54 <b>test</b> <b>flights.</b> The spacecraft {{has used}} its [...] "feathered" [...] wing configuration during ten of these <b>test</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|EPNER {{provides}} {{training for}} <b>test</b> pilots, <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> engineers, <b>flight</b> engineers and technicians involved in <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> and airtraffic controllers involved {{in control of}} <b>flight</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
5|$|AS-204 {{was to be}} {{the first}} manned <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) to Earth orbit, {{launched}} on a Saturn IB rocket. AS-204 was to test launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the spacecraft performed.|$|E
5|$|Data and {{conclusions}} from these tests {{were published in}} Informational Intelligence Summary 59, Technical Aviation Intelligence Brief #3, Tactical and Technical Trends #5 (published prior to the first <b>test</b> <b>flight),</b> and Informational Intelligence Summary 85. These results tend to somewhat understate the Zero's capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Development of the prototypes of {{what are}} {{now known as the}} 'Air Gates' began in 2002 and renowned Hungarian pilot Péter Besenyei {{successfully}} completed the first <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> through them. After two years in planning and development, the first official Red Bull Air Race was ready to take off in Zeltweg, Austria in 2003. A second was staged the same year near Budapest in Hungary.|$|E
50|$|Work on the C.6bis {{started in}} 1939, {{with the first}} <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> in 1940. Soon after first <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> the Latvian Air Force {{accepted}} the aircraft and ordered twelve.|$|R
50|$|The {{personnel}} began assembling crated {{aircraft and}} carrying out pre-issue <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> as a Receipt and Dispatch Unit. A total of 2,500 <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> were undertaken during {{the operation of}} HMS Nabberley.|$|R
50|$|Nine LV-3Bs were launched, two on {{unmanned}} suborbital <b>test</b> <b>flights,</b> {{three on}} unmanned orbital <b>test</b> <b>flights,</b> and four with manned Mercury spacecraft. Atlas LV-3B launches were conducted from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, 37 {{years after}} its first <b>test</b> <b>flight,</b> Concorde was {{announced}} {{the winner of the}} Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. A total of 212,000 votes were cast with Concorde beating other British design icons such as the Mini, mini skirt, Jaguar E-Type, Tube map, the World Wide Web, K2 telephone box and the Supermarine Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|JF-17BA twin-seater variant {{scheduled}} to {{be inducted into the}} Pakistan Air Force by 2017, its multi-roles include use for training and enhanced surveillance and support capabilities. The production of the first JF-17B was initiated by Pakistan and China in 2016. On 28 April 2017, the JF-17B took its maiden <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> in Chengdu.|$|E
5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 <b>test</b> <b>flight,</b> atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> {{program of}} up to 60 flights has been proposed. An outline for thirty of those flights {{includes}} two propulsive assist (parachutes plus thrusters) and two propulsive landing (no parachutes) landing-only <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> where DragonFly will be dropped from a helicopter {{at an altitude of}} approximately 10000 ft. The other 26 <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> are projected to be vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> that will take off from a purpose-built pad: eight to be propulsive assist hops (landing with parachutes plus thrusters) and 18 to be full propulsive hops where the landing is made with only rocket propulsion, similar to the Grasshopper and F9R Dev booster stage <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> that SpaceX also flies out of their McGregor facility.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} there were serious reliability problems {{with both the}} new Proton rocket and the similarly new Soyuz spacecraft, but the <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> pressed ahead with some glitches. The majority of <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> from 1967-1970 (Zond 4 to Zond 8) showed problems during re-entry.|$|R
2500|$|Three more <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> {{were planned}} {{and used the}} same flight trajectory. [...] Boeing {{proposed}} to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) that two <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> be added to increase the total to six, with flights taking place at four to six week intervals, provided there are no failures.|$|R
5|$|The type's first fatal {{accident}} occurred on 30 June 1994 near Toulouse on a <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> when an Airbus-owned A330-300 crashed while simulating an engine failure on climbout, killing all seven on board. Airbus subsequently advised A330 operators to disconnect the autopilot and limit pitch {{attitude in the}} event of an engine failure at low speed.|$|E
5|$|Filton {{played a}} key role in the Anglo-French Concorde {{supersonic}} airliner project during the 1960s. The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French <b>test</b> <b>flight.</b> In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to discontinue Concorde flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide. On 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Bristol Filton Airport as the centrepiece of a proposed air museum which is planned to include the existing Bristol Aero collection (including a Bristol Britannia).|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Antoniu {{wrote that}} he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated {{on the basis of}} the {{evidence}} of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a <b>test</b> <b>flight.</b> Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.|$|E
50|$|In May 2002, the Z-10 {{tail rotor}} {{and some other}} {{components}} were tested on the ground by the 602nd Research Institute. In April 2003, a Z-10 prototype completed its maiden flight at Lumeng (吕蒙) airfield, the airfield having been assigned to CAIC for such use. According to Chinese sources, the initial <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> were concluded on December 17, 2003, whereas according to other sources they were completed nine months earlier in March 2003. According to Jane's Information Group, a total of 3 prototypes had completed over 400 hours of <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> by this time. By 2004 3 more prototypes were built, {{for a total of}} 6, and a second stage of <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> were concluded on December 15, 2004. In one of the <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> the future commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army Ground Force Air Force (PLAGAF), Song Xiangsheng (宋湘生), was on board the prototype. A third stage of intensive <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> followed, taking place during both day and night. By January 2006 weaponry and sensor tests, including firing of live ammunition, were taking place.|$|R
5000|$|Nine taxi {{tests and}} twenty-five <b>test</b> <b>flights</b> of the OK-GLI were performed, {{after which the}} vehicle was [...] "worn out". All <b>tests</b> and <b>flights</b> were carried out at Baikonur.|$|R

5|$|Manned Apollo {{flights were}} {{suspended}} for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, {{the development and}} unmanned testing of the Lunar Module (LM) and Saturn V Moon rocket continued. The Saturn IB launch vehicle for Apollo 1, AS-204, {{was used for the}} first LM <b>test</b> <b>flight,</b> Apollo 5. The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on Apollo 7 in October 1968.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1918, Baker {{received}} {{orders to}} return to the United States. Reluctant to leave France and return to his life in America, he decided to take a final flight at his squadron's airfield in Toul. As he went for his own plane, the mechanic brought out a recently repaired one instead, in need of a <b>test</b> <b>flight.</b> The other pilots remonstrated with Baker, but he maintained that as commanding officer he could not let anyone else test the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a <b>test</b> <b>flight,</b> killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing {{personnel}} from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency landing in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E

5|$|On September 29, Walter Schirra, Eisele, and Walter Cunningham {{were named}} {{as the prime}} crew for a second Block I CSM flight, AS-205. NASA planned to follow this with an {{unmanned}} <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> of the LM (AS-206), then the third manned mission would be a dual flight designated AS-278 (or AS-207/208), in which AS-207 would launch the first manned Block II CSM, which would then rendezvous and dock with the LM launched unmanned on AS-208.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) {{in case of a}} launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A size bigger than the NAA Little Joe would be required, so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963 qualification <b>test</b> <b>flight,</b> four LES test flights (A-001 through 004) were made at the White Sands Missile Range between May 1964 and January 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese never {{spotted the}} D-21B. The first one failed {{to turn around}} and {{continued}} straight on, crashing somewhere in the Soviet Union. Another <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor and back to the recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E
50|$|The YT34 engine {{with three}} wide-bladed {{propellers}} {{was made for}} two Navy Lockheed R7V-2 Constellation(C-121s) variants, for <b>testing.</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>tests</b> were on 1 September 1954.|$|R
