5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> <b>As</b> a result, {{it was thought that}} the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E

However, Mari was allowed <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> a small village under Babylonian administration, an act that Hammurabi considered merciful. Later, Mari became part of Assyria and was listed among the territories conquered by the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (reigned 1243–1207 BC). Afterward, Mari constantly changed hands between Assyria and Babylon.|$|E

5|$|Tarnovo was {{captured}} by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 brought about {{the fall of the}} Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an inferior class of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and {{a small portion of the}} Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation, and their culture was suppressed. Ottoman authorities established the Rum Millet, a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians. However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>as</b> in some rural, remote areas, as well as in the militant Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country.|$|E

25|$|In massive stars, {{the core}} is already large enough {{at the onset}} of the {{hydrogen}} burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron degeneracy pressure has a chance to become prevalent. Thus, when these stars expand and cool, they do not brighten as much as lower-mass stars; however, they were much brighter than lower-mass stars to begin with, and are thus still brighter than the red giants formed from less-massive stars.
