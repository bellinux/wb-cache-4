She then attempted <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} was announced, NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation, as no NBA {{franchise}} had moved since 1985, when the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California. He stated that his goal was that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there. The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team. The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on the issue.

5|$|Kim's {{associates}} {{characterize the}} director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka recalls that Kim's way {{of writing a}} screenplay was <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen to neighborhood gossip, and write all night in the dark. South Korean film critic Lee Young-il remembers that Kim's shoes were never shined, {{and that one of}} his few material pleasures was high-quality coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry. The only official title he held within the film community was member of The National Academy of Arts, which he joined in 1997, and he did not cultivate friendships with journalists who could further his career.|$|E
5|$|They are {{alerted to}} {{eyewitness}} accounts {{of a woman}} who, after jumping with another man from a high roof and crashing onto a taxi parked below, simply walked away. As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity at Indianapolis.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{match was}} the main event from the SmackDown brand, a {{standard}} match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At {{the beginning of the}} match, Lesnar tried <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including DDT and Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon, who had accompanied Lesnar to the ring, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.|$|E

50|$|The Webster {{ruling is}} a test case in {{association}} football law involving Andy Webster, a defender formerly with Heart of Midlothian football club in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark Bosman ruling of 1995 in its potential significance.|$|R

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate whether an established behavioural intervention, <b>Walking</b> <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> Type 2 Diabetes, is effective at promoting and sustaining increased walking activity when delivered within primary care. METHODS: Cluster randomized controlled trial involving 10 general practices recruited from Leicestershire, UK, in 2009 - 2010. Eight hundred and eight (36 % female) individuals with a high risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, identified through a validated risk score, were included. Participants in five practices were randomized <b>to</b> <b>Walking</b> <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> Type 2 Diabetes, a pragmatic 3 -h group-based structured education programme incorporating pedometer use with annual follow-on refresher sessions. The primary outcome was accelerometer assessed ambulatory activity (steps/day) at 12 months. Longer term maintenance was assessed at 24 and 36 months. Results were analysed using generalized estimating equation models, accounting for clustering. RESULTS: Complete accelerometer data for the primary outcome were available for 571 (71 %) participants. Increases in ambulatory activity of 411 steps/day [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 117, 704] and self-reported vigorous-intensity physical activity of 218 metabolic equivalent min/week (95 % CI: 6, 425) at 12 months were observed in the intervention group compared with control; differences between groups were not sustained at 36 months. No differences between groups were observed for markers of cardiometabolic health. Replacing missing data with multiple imputation did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS: A pragmatic low-resource group-based structured education programme with pedometer use resulted in modest increases in ambulatory activity compared with control conditions after 12 months when implemented within a primary care setting to those at high risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, the results were not maintained over 36 months.

25|$|During the off-season, the Jazz {{gained a}} {{hometown}} NBA Development League affiliate in the Utah Flash (based in Orem), which they {{shared with the}} Boston Celtics. They selected Morris Almond in the first round, although ultimately they made few lineup changes. The most significant move was in letting Derek Fisher go.

Fisher moved to Los Angeles during the off-season {{to be closer to}} better care for his daughter, and later signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. Controversy arose after Kirilenko led his Russian national team to a win in EuroBasket 2007 (the European championship), a tournament in which he was named MVP.
