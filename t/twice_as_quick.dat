For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3times as fast (2.3 times faster), and its boot-up time was more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>quick.</b> The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests XBench and Cinebench. Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors. Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440×900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440×960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen [...] "nothing less than stellar". Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter, although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances. They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine. The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, mining for gold {{has been a major}} {{catalyst}} for ecological, political, demographic and socio-economic change in the Amazon rainforest (Cleary 1990; MacMillan 1995; Schmink and Wood 1992). This chapter describes these dynamics for the small Amazon country of Suriname (Figure 1). No-one knows exactly how many people are mining for gold in Suriname. Our estimates suggest that there are between 20, 000 and 25, 000 small-gold miners active in Suriname at any given time 1. However, some believe that there may be <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> many (<b>Quick</b> et al. 2001). Even though Suriname miners constitute a small proportion {{of the total number of}} miners in the Trans-Amazon region, their activities are reshaping economics, politics, land-use, the natural environment, and social relations in Suriname. Small-scale gold mining provides foreign exchange to the economy of Suriname and a livelihood for many of the rural poor. These economic benefits are offset by an increase in violent crime; a malaria epidemic; the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; mercury pollution of the aquatic ecosystem and forest peoples; and a degraded forest ecosystem (De Kom, Van Der Voet, an...|$|R

She also grows <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> in level as all other characters, allowing her to catch up, but this term later tells that she becomes weaker. However, she possesses a few curative techniques. Her main, and only, choice of weapons are bars (claws in the Japanese version).|$|E

40|$|On 29 May, the Council and the Parliament {{reached a}} {{political}} {{agreement on a}} package reforming the legislation on new psychoactive substances (NPS) used as alternatives to illicit drugs. The new mechanism will allow for a more effective and efficient EU response to new psychoactive substances, which are appearing on the EU market at an unprecedented pace, posing a risk to public health and safety. Carmelo Abela, {{minister for home affairs}} and national security of Malta said: "Legal highs are a growing problem for public health in Europe and it is young people who are most at risk. With these new rules, the EU will provide a faster and more effective response. We will be able to drastically reduce the time needed to assess and possibly decide on an EU wide ban of new psychoactive substances". The package will streamline the procedure at EU level for assessing the potential negative effects of a new psychoactive substance and decide on a possible ban. This procedure will now be nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> as before. Also, the new rules will further reduce from 12 to 6 months the time for member states to implement the EU decision at the national level. The package also aims at improving the information exchange, early warning system and risk assessment procedure at EU level. The package is composed of an amendment to the founding regulation of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) regarding information exchange, early warning system and risk assessment procedure on psychoactive substances and a directive amending the Council framework decision from 2004 on the minimum provision on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking. Next steps Based on the political agreement reached between the two institutions, the texts will be formally adopted by both institutions in the coming months. Background New psychoactive substances are natural or synthetic substances that affect the central nervous system and induce an effect, similar to that of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, heroin or cannabis. They can cause hallucinations, alterations in thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood and other undesired effects. In fact, they are often marketed as legal alternatives to illicit drugs, hence the name of so-called 'legal highs'. The need for an amendment to the legislation on psychoactive substance {{was the result of the}} rapid and massive expansion of new psychoactive substances (NPS), at global level and in Europe. 98 new psychoactive substances were reported for the first time to the EU Early Warning System (EWS) in 2015 and 66 in 2016, bringing the total number of new substances monitored to more than 600 - with more than 460 (over 75...|$|E
