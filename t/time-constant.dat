This is because the phase-shifter elements in the antenna are non-reciprocal and the phase shift must be adjusted before and after each transmit pulse. Spurious phase shift is produced by the sudden impulse of the phase shift, and settling during the receive period between transmit pulses places Doppler modulation onto stationary clutter. That receive modulation corrupts the measure of performance for sub-clutter visibility. Phase shifter settling time {{on the order of}} 50ns is required.

A direction-dependent permeability of the endplates, favouring inflow over outflow, reportedly explains this; however, fluid flow through the annulus fibrosus should be considered. This study investigates the fluid flow of entire intervertebral discs. Caprine discs were preloaded in saline for 24 h under four levels of static load. Under sustained load, we modulated the disc׳s swelling pressure by exchanging saline for demineralised water (inflow) and back to saline (outflow), both for 24 h. We measured disc height creep and used stretched exponential models to determine <b>time-constants.</b> During inflow disc height increased in relation to applied load, and during outflow disc height decreased to preload levels. When comparing in- and outflow phases, {{there was no difference in}} creep, and <b>time-constants</b> were similar indicating no direction-dependent resistance to fluid flow in the entire intervertebral disc. Results provoked a new hypothesis for diurnal fluid flow: in vitro <b>time-constants</b> for loading are shorter than for unloading and in vivo daytime loading {{is twice as}} long as night time unloading, i. e. in diurnal loading the intervertebral disc is closer to loading equilibrium than to unloading equilibrium.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the main control goal, some additional goals or constraints may be specified. A typical example is the [...] "small control" [...] requirement: the control function should have little power or should require a small expenditure of energy. Such a restriction is needed to avoid [...] "violence" [...] and preserve the inherent properties of the system under control. This is important for ensuring the elimination of artefacts and for an adequate study of the system. Three types of control are used in physical problems: constant control, feedforward control and feedback control. Implementation of a feedback control requires additional measurement devices working in real time, which are often hard to install. Therefore, studying the system may start with the application of inferior forms of control: <b>time-constant</b> and then feedforward control. The possibilities of changing system behavior by means of feedback control can then be studied.|$|E

Since all wires have some self-inductance and resistance, all circuits have a time constant. As a result, when the power supply is switched on, the current does not instantaneously reach its steady-state value, [...] The rise instead takes several time-constants to complete. If this were not the case, and the current were to reach steady-state immediately, extremely strong inductive electric fields would be generated by the sharp change in the magnetic field [...] - [...] this would lead to breakdown of {{the air in the}} circuit and electric arcing, probably damaging components (and users).|$|E
