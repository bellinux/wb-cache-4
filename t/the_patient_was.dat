5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> in no state to express a considered view. After the operation {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} built train car interiors for {{the quarantine}} car where <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> being kept and the sleeper cars, and floated the train sets on inner tubes {{to create the}} feeling of movement. Seven different cameras were used by director Rob Bowman when filming the train car explosion. Forty-five gallons of gasoline and 120 black-powder bombs {{were used for the}} effect. The car used had been obtained cheaply from a Vancouver-based rail company, and had been considered scrap due to being bent. After the explosion was recorded, a bell from the train was recovered some distance from the site by the physical effects supervisor Dave Gauthier, who had it polished and engraved with a message for Bowman.|$|E

The seventh confirmed fatality was a 24-year-old man, who smoke and suffered obesity.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was to secure the cura of a medicus. If <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> too sick to move one sent for a clinicus, who went to the clinum or couch of the patient. Of higher status were the chirurgii (which became the English word surgeon), from Greek cheir (hand) and ourgon (work).

25|$|There is {{a debate}} within the medical and {{bioethics}} literature {{about whether or not}} the non-voluntary (and by extension, involuntary) killing of patients can be regarded as euthanasia, irrespective of intent or the patient's circumstances. In the definitions offered by Beauchamp and Davidson and, later, by Wreen, consent on the part of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> not considered as one of their criteria, although it may have been required to justify euthanasia. However, others see consent as essential.|$|E
25|$|Because Erickson {{expected}} trance {{states to}} occur naturally and frequently, {{he was prepared}} to exploit them therapeutically, even when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> not present with him in the consulting room. He also discovered many techniques for increasing the likelihood that a trance state would occur. He developed both verbal and non-verbal techniques and pioneered the idea that the common experiences of wonderment, engrossment and confusion are, in fact, just kinds of trance.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{incidence}} of cerebral infarction increased with advancing age where 85.6 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> between 46 and 90  years and 14.4 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> ≤[*] 45  years.|$|R

25|$|Māori {{were badly}} {{hit by the}} 1918 {{influenza}} epidemic when the Māori battalion returned from the Western Front. The death rate from influenza for Māori was 4.5 times higher than for Pakeha. Many Māori, especially in the Waikato, were very reluctant to visit a doctor {{and went to a}} hospital only when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> nearly dead. To cope with isolation, Waikato Māori, under Te Puea's leadership, increasingly returned to the old Pai Marire (Hau hau) cult of the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 2009 one new {{death was}} confirmed. The victim was a 34-year-old {{woman who was}} in the 34th week of pregnancy. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> treated and {{admitted}} into a private hospital in Johor Baru on 8 Aug after developing fever and cough for a day.

However, she died on next day due to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{patients}} after the Battle of Borodino in 1812 was an infantry officer whose arm had to be amputated at the shoulder. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> evacuated immediately following the operation and passed from Russia, through Poland and Germany. On his arrival {{at his home in}} France the dressing was removed and the wound found to be healed. Larrey concluded that the fact that the wound had been undisturbed had facilitated healing. After the war, Larrey began stiffening bandages using camphorated alcohol, lead acetate and egg whites beaten in water.|$|E
50|$|When medical {{professionals}} use this term {{to describe the}} position of a patient, they first state the part of the body on which <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> resting followed by the word decubitus. For example, the right lateral decubitus would mean that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> lying on his or her right side. Left lateral decubitus position (LLDP) would mean that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> lying on his or her left side.|$|R
50|$|In the {{respiratory}} examination, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> asked to sit upright on an examination table, with arms at the side. Adequate lighting <b>is</b> ensured and <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> asked to expose {{his or her}} chest.|$|R
5000|$|When {{testing at}} near, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> to fixate on light source at 33 cm, which is held at eye level. When testing at distance, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> to fixate {{on a light}} source at 6m.|$|R
25|$|Visual {{extinction}} {{has also}} been researched {{with regard to the}} effect of repetition on visual detection rate. Patients were shown a colored (red or green) letter (O or E), one to each visual field, and then asked variably to report the color or shape of one letter or the other. Extinction was found to be increased in the contralesional field when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> asked to report on a repeated characteristic – if both stimuli had been the same shape, or same color – regardless of whether the other characteristic had also been changed. This is another example of repetition blindness.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya {{was well}} known for his {{surgical}} skill and in 1977 he completed a difficult removal of a spinal arterio-venous malformation (AVM) which received attention in the lay press. During the 18-hour operation <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> placed in total body hypothermia and total circulatory arrest for 45 minutes. The hypothermia was needed to slow metabolism and protect the brain and organs from reduced oxygen supply while Ommaya surgically embolized and removed an AVM which was located near the medulla. Ommaya was the honorary physician to the President of Pakistan. Ommaya also appeared with Peter Ustinov, Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon in the movie Lorenzo's Oil released in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Sacks {{described}} his cases with {{a wealth of}} narrative detail, concentrating on {{the experiences of the}} patient (in the case of his A Leg to Stand On, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>was</b> himself). The patients he described were often able to adapt to their situation in different ways despite the fact that their neurological conditions were usually considered incurable. His book Awakenings, upon which the 1990 feature film of the same name is based, describes his experiences using the new drug levodopa on Beth Abraham Hospital post-encephalitic patients. Awakenings was also the subject of the first documentary made (in 1974) for the British television series Discovery.|$|E
25|$|As {{it occurs}} infrequently, {{many cases of}} MODY are {{initially}} assumed to be more common forms of diabetes: type 1 if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> young and not overweight, type 2 if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> overweight, or gestational diabetes if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> pregnant. Standard diabetes treatments (insulin for type 1 and gestational diabetes, and oral hypoglycemic agents for type 2) are often initiated before the doctor suspects a more unusual form of diabetes.|$|R
50|$|Once {{ready for}} treatment, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{placed on a}} proctology table in the kneeling position. Less commonly <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> laid down {{on the left side}} on an exam table, with knees drawn up (fetal position).|$|R
