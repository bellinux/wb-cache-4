However a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair. During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as a prison, an administrative centre, and a court of law. In 1580–81 the castle was designated as a prison for Catholic recusants, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that it was ever used for that purpose.|$|E
