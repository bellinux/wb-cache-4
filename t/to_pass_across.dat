5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure and attempted <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>across</b> {{the stern of}} the rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
25|$|Rooney added {{a fourth}} goal for Manchester United (his second) two {{minutes before the}} half-time break; Ronaldo picked up the ball just inside his own half before driving forward and passing to Park on the right wing.

25|$|At the lap four restart, Vernay {{made ground}} up on Ericsson, {{and managed to}} {{slipstream}} past the All-Japan Formula Three champion on the run to Lisboa. Ricciardo tried a similar move on Bottas but could not manage to complete the pass, and such was his momentum loss, Vanthoor managed to slip through on the Australian into fifth position. Another Carlin driver in the wars was Hartley, as he clouted Coletti out of eighth position. Over the succeeding laps, Asmer's lap record from 2007 took a pounding as first Mortara and then Vernay took the lap record into the 2:10 bracket. However, any further progress for the record to fall was halted by a huge accident that befell Boyd on lap seven. Running in eleventh position, the young Ulsterman pulled out to pass his team-mate Mäki on the exit of the Mandarin, but clipped the car's left rear wheel at 170mph. Boyd's Dallara became airborne and was launched into a frightening aerial somersault, landing upside down before righting itself via a hit with the retaining wall. His car rebounded across the circuit, and was luckily avoided by {{every one of the}} cars around him on track. The crash meant the last three laps of the race were completed behind the safety car, and pulled in to allow the cars <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>across</b> the line without overtaking. This allowed Vernay to win the race, securing pole position for the main race on Sunday. Ericsson was second ahead of Mortara– once he had returned the place back to the Swede– with Bottas, Vanthoor, Ricciardo, Bird, Iguchi, Merhi and Mäki completing the top ten. Outside the top ten were van der Zande, Kunimoto, Sims, García, Chilton, Cozzolino, Dusseldorp, Saga, Huertas, Zampieri, Bianchi and Coletti after their respective collisions, Imperatori, Hartley, McKenzie and Ho rounded out the 26 classified finishers.|$|E

500|$|At 06:00 on 6 February Duckworth's scouts sighted the French, observing two frigates, five {{ships of}} the line and one large {{merchant}} ship anchored in line at the entrance to Santo Domingo. Leissègues had reportedly issued orders for the squadron to sail for Jamaica, even though several of the French ships were not yet ready for sea, and two frigates were already under sail when the British arrived. Leissègues was not aboard Impérial; he and a number of his officers were still conducting their business in the town and were therefore forced to join the squadron in small boats, which delayed the squadron. Several officers, possibly including Leissègues, did not reach their ships until after the engagement had begun. Recognising that his enemy was in a vulnerable position, Duckworth raised all sail in an effort to close with the French. Leissègues too recognised the danger his ships were in and ordered them to raise anchor and then to sail westwards along the coast in the direction of Nizao. Maintaining close formation, the French formed a line of battle, Captain Pierre-Elie Garreau in Alexandre leading, with Impérial, Diomède, Jupiter and Brave following. [...] The frigates and corvette took a position between the battle line and the shore. Duckworth was concerned that there might be other French forces to the west. He therefore angled his line of attack <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>across</b> the front of the French line and signaled to his squadron to direct their fire at the front three ships: Alexandre, Impérial and Diomède.|$|E
2500|$|Until the Second World War, the Indian Ocean {{had been}} a British [...] "lake". It was ringed by {{significant}} British and Commonwealth possessions {{and much of the}} strategic supplies needed in peace and war had <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>across</b> it: i.e. Persian oil, Malayan rubber, Indian tea, Australian and New Zealand foodstuffs. Britain also utilised Australian and New Zealand manpower; hence, safe passage for British cargo ships was critical.|$|E
