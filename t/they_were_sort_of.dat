McCartney commented: [...] "Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> magic". As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line [...] "darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there" [...] from [...] "Eleanor Rigby".|$|E

[...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But I felt like the lead because it was my story about falling in love with this woman and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where you take a character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{novel was}} {{inspired}} by a story Saunders's wife's cousin told him about how Lincoln visited his son Willie's crypt on several occasions to hold the body, a story that seems to be verified by contemporary newspaper accounts. In March 2017, Saunders provided more details on the background and conception of his novel: Many years ago, during a visit to Washington DC, my wife’s cousin pointed out to us a crypt on a hill and mentioned that, in 1862, while Abraham Lincoln was president, his beloved son, Willie, died, and was temporarily interred in that crypt, and that the grief-stricken Lincoln had, according to the newspapers of the day, entered the crypt “on several occasions” to hold the boy’s body. An image spontaneously leapt into my mind - a melding of the Lincoln Memorial and the Pietà. I carried that image around for the next 20-odd years, too scared to try something that seemed so profound, and then finally, in 2012, noticing that I wasn’t getting any younger, not wanting to be the guy whose own gravestone would read “Afraid to Embark on Scary Artistic Project He Desperately Longed to Attempt”, decided to take a run at it, in exploratory fashion, no commitments. My novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, is the result of that attempt .... Saunders first announced his novel in a 2015 New York Times interview with author and novelist Jennifer Egan, revealing that it would have a “supernatural element” while remaining “ostensibly historical". The novel's title was announced in an April 2016 conversation between Saunders and Susan Sarandon in Interview Magazine. Later the same month, a summary of the book was released on the Random House website. Without giving anything away, let me say this: I made a bunch of ghosts. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> cynical; they were stuck in this realm, called the bardo (from the Tibetan notion of a sort of transitional purgatory between rebirths), stuck because they’d been unhappy or unsatisfied in life. The greatest part of their penance is that they feel utterly inessential - incapable of influencing the living. [...] - [...] George Saunders (2017) ...|$|E
