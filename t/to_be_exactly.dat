5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet {{designated}} Gliese 876 b. In 2001, further analysis of the star's radial velocity revealed {{the existence of a}} second planet in the system, which was designated Gliese 876 c. The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> half that of the outer planet, which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E

25|$|The rate {{at which}} stimulated {{emission}} occurs {{is proportional to the}} number of atoms N2 in the excited state, and the radiation density of the light. The base probability of a photon causing stimulated emission in a single excited atom was shown by Albert Einstein <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> equal to the probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom in the ground state. Therefore, when the numbers of atoms in the ground and excited states are equal, the rate of stimulated emission is equal to the rate of absorption for a given radiation density.|$|E
25|$|When the {{original}} sound sources are perfectly periodic, the note consists of several related sine waves (which mathematically add to each other) called the fundamental and the harmonics, partials, or overtones. The sounds have harmonic frequency spectra. The lowest frequency present is the fundamental, {{and is the}} frequency at which the entire wave vibrates. The overtones vibrate faster than the fundamental, but must vibrate at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency for the total wave <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> the same each cycle. Real instruments are close to periodic, but the frequencies of the overtones are slightly imperfect, so {{the shape of the}} wave changes slightly over time.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, the German chemist Friedrich August Kekulé {{published}} {{a paper in}} French (for he was then teaching in Francophone Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a ring of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. The next year he {{published a}} much longer paper in German on the same subject. Kekulé used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening years—namely, that there always appeared to be only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene, and that there always appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> three isomers of every disubstituted derivative—now understood to correspond to the ortho, meta, and para patterns of arene substitution—to argue {{in support of his}} proposed structure. Kekulé's symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts, as well as benzene's 1:1 carbon-hydrogen ratio.|$|E
25|$|The attackers took {{approximately}} 1,100 hostages.

In 2005, their number was put at 1,128. The militants herded their captives into the school's gym and confiscated all their mobile phones under threat of death, and ordered everyone to speak in Russian and only when spoken to. When a father named Ruslan Betrozov stood to calm people and repeat the rules in the local language, Ossetic, a gunman approached him, asked Betrozov if he was done, and then shot him in the head. Another father named Vadim Bolloyev, who refused to kneel, was also shot by a captor and then bled to death. Their bodies were dragged from the sports hall, leaving a trail of blood later visible in the video made by the hostage-takers.|$|E

500|$|Notice {{that the}} {{boundary}} of anti-de Sitter space has fewer dimensions than anti-de Sitter space itself. For instance, in the three-dimensional example illustrated above, the boundary is a two-dimensional surface. The AdS/CFT correspondence {{is often described as}} a [...] "holographic duality" [...] because this relationship between the two theories is similar to the relationship between a three-dimensional object and its image as a hologram. Although a hologram is two-dimensional, it encodes information about all three dimensions of the object it represents. In the same way, theories which are related by the AdS/CFT correspondence are conjectured <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> equivalent, despite living in different numbers of dimensions. The conformal field theory is like a hologram which captures information about the higher-dimensional quantum gravity theory.|$|E
500|$|Blue Velvet was {{released}} to a polarized reception in the United States. The critics who did praise the film were often vociferous. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin directed much praise toward {{the performances of}} Hopper and Rossellini: [...] "Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best {{understood in terms of}} sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> what's called for." [...] She called it [...] "an instant cult classic." [...] Maslin concluded by saying that Blue Velvet [...] "is as fascinating as it is freakish. It confirms Mr. Lynch's stature as an innovator, a superb technician, and someone best not encountered in a dark alley." ...|$|E
500|$|The CCU {{proposal}} {{recommended that}} {{the text of the}} definitions of all the base units be either refined or rewritten changing the emphasis from explicit-unit to explicit-constant type definitions. Explicit-unit type definitions define a unit in terms of a specific example of that unit—for example in 1324 Edward II defined the inch as being the length of three barleycorns and since 1889 the kilogram has been defined as being the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram. In explicit-constant definitions, a constant of nature is given a specified value and the definition of the unit emerges as a consequence. For example, in 1983, the speed of light was defined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> [...] metres per second and, since the second had been independently defined, the length of the metre could thus be derived.|$|E

500|$|It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} how the exact value for the magic number was determined. [...] Chris Lomont developed a function to minimize approximation error by choosing the magic number R over a range. He first computed the optimal constant for the linear approximation step as 0x5F37642F, close to 0x5F3759DF, but this new constant gave slightly less accuracy after one iteration of Newton's method. Lomont then searched for a constant optimal even after one and two Newton iterations and found 0x5F375A86, which is more accurate than the original at every iteration stage. He concluded by asking whether the exact value of the original constant was chosen through derivation or trial and error. [...] Lomont {{pointed out that the}} magic number for 64 bit IEEE754 size type double is 0x5FE6EC85E7DE30DA, but it was later shown by Matthew Robertson <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> 0x5FE6EB50C7B537A9.|$|E

Family friend Bessie Rayner Belloc wrote in 1895 that [...] "everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow {{in and out of the}} house.
