5|$|Web-spinning {{also caused}} the {{association}} of the spider with creation myths, as <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the ability to produce their own worlds. Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art.|$|E
5|$|In Zambia, Gryllotalpa africana is held {{to bring}} {{good fortune to}} anyone who sees it. In Latin America, Scapteriscus and Neocurtilla mole crickets are said to predict rain when they dig into the ground. In Japan in the past <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{associated}} with the worms/corpses/bugs that announce a persons sins to heaven in the Koshin/Koushin belief—see the spirit ghoul shokera/shoukera.|$|E

50|$|The current {{existence}} of JCP is unclear. There {{was also a}} Communist Party of Guernsey though <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed even less electoral success and are a defunct political entity.|$|R
5|$|More {{is known}} about the role of Athenian {{children}} in religion than about any other aspect of their lives, and <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> played a prominent role in religious ceremonies. Girls made offerings to Artemis on the eve of their marriage, during pregnancy, and at childbirth. Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early-spring festival of the Anthesteria, depictions of boys are far more common.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia {{over the issue of}} whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E
5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E
5000|$|The {{points and}} sides of their tools {{indicate}} a [...] "Moustero-Levalloisian" [...] element. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a masterful knowledge of Upper Palaeolithic technology, producing blades as much as fifteen centimeters long.|$|R
6000|$|But to-night <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> drawn nearer {{in spirit}} to each other, and that, maybe, {{it was that}} {{prompted}} Valerie to sigh, and in her sweet, unthinking innocence to say again: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{rebellion}} are unclear, but <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated in the suspicions of the Archbishop of Manila Miguel de Benavides, O. P., that the Chinese <b>had</b> ambitions <b>to</b> control the Philippines.|$|R
5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz apartment building in Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{cathedral chapter}} was {{composed}} of monks, and he was considered the abbot of the monastery of Christ Church Cathedral. Because of his episcopal duties, the regular running of the cathedral was {{the responsibility of the}} prior. At the time of Theobald's election there were about 140 monks in the chapter, and <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> expected that Theobald, being a monk himself, would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs. Theobald began well, sending a party of monks from the cathedral to St Martin's Priory at Dover, which had been settled with canons instead of monks. Theobald replaced the canons with the monks. Theobald also refounded a collegiate church at South Malling near Lewes to provide benefices for his cathedral chapter.|$|E
5|$|After a one-month {{hospital}} stay, Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld {{was promoted}} to Major and made Geschwaderkommodore of Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG5) on 20 February 1944. He and his crew, Oberfeldwebel Josef Renette and Unteroffizier Kurt Röber, {{were killed in a}} flying accident on 12 March 1944 on a routine flight from Parchim to Athies-sous-Laon. Above Belgium, <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> encountered a bad weather zone with low clouds and a dense snowstorm and it was assumed that the aircraft hit the high Ardennes ground after being forced to fly lower because of ice forming on the wings. The exact circumstances of this flight may never be known, the Bf 110 G-4 C9+CD (Werknummer 720 010—factory number) crashed into the Ardennes mountains near St. Hubert where the completely burned-out wreck was found the following day. The funeral service was held in the city church of Linz on 15 March 1944. Prinz Egmont zur Lippe-Weißenfeld and Prinz Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein are buried side by side at Ysselsteyn in the Netherlands.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think so?" [...] he said gravely. He {{had been}} gazing abstractedly at some shining brown seaweed in the water, {{and when he}} raised his eyes <b>to</b> hers <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> caught its color.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{rooms of}} this {{corridor}} {{had been all}} emptied but ours. We were four together; whom <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> forgotten: we addressed our prayers in common to the Eternal to be delivered from this peril.|$|R

60|$|With {{a violent}} start Neuman looked {{out to see}} the ghastly {{placarded}} figure, and then he sank slowly back in his seat. The cowboys apparently took no notice of him. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> forgotten his presence.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{brought him}} down to a {{velveteen}} jacket and trousers very much the worse for wear, a particularly small red waistcoat like a gorget, an interval of blue check, and the hat before mentioned.|$|R

50|$|Things {{changed since}} 1932 when a written {{constitution}} was adopted. The customary {{rights of the}} Giraavaru people were not recognised in that document.

25|$|However much {{apart from}} noble court the Petres may have kept themselves, <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{popular in the}} vicinity, and kind and liberal neighbours, for they are not {{infrequently}} referred to by travellers, and Daniel Defoe writes of them in his A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain (1724–1726).|$|E
25|$|These {{figures are}} {{much smaller than}} the better-known stone moai. They are made of wood and have a small, slender aspect, giving them a sad appearance.

60|$|For one who {{had left}} London a {{glittering}} star, it was wonderful how little he brightened it by returning. At the club {{they did not know}} that he had been away. In society <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> forgotten <b>to</b> expect him back.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Carroll {{instantly}} recovered her temper, {{changed the}} subject, and privately resolved to confine her prejudices {{to her own}} bosom, as <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an aggravating effect upon the youthful person whom she had set her heart on disposing of to the best advantage.|$|R
