5|$|During this time, St. Anthony, on {{the east}} side, was {{separate}} from Minneapolis, on the west side.

Some people and organizations started to talk about merging the <b>two</b> <b>cities.</b> A citizens' committee recommended merging the <b>two</b> <b>cities</b> in 1866, but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867. The <b>two</b> <b>cities</b> found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head of navigation of the Mississippi River, and more access to railroads.|$|E
