5|$|In 1482, Leonardo, who {{according}} to Vasari was a talented musician, created a silver lyre {{in the shape}} of a horse's head. Lorenzo de' Medici sent Leonardo to Milan, bearing the lyre as a gift, to secure peace with Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. At this time Leonardo wrote an often-quoted letter describing the many marvellous and diverse <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could achieve in the field of engineering and informing Ludovico that he could also paint.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was an 18th century Court Jew in the employ of Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg in Stuttgart. As a {{financial}} advisor for Duke Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, he also gained a prominent {{position as a}} court Jew and held the reins of the finances in his duchy. He established a duchy monopoly on the trade of salt, leather, tobacco, and liquor and founded a bank and porcelain factory. In the process, he {{made a number of}} enemies who claimed, among other <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was involved with local gambling houses.|$|E
5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
60|$|But, {{to return}} to the more {{immediate}} subject of our lucubrations: It seems almost like a fatality, that Lord Byron has hardly ever praised any <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has not at some other period censured, or censured any <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has not, by and bye, praised or practised.|$|R

25|$|Thompson {{continued}} to be mentioned as a potential candidate, but did not officially declare his candidacy. On June 12, Thompson told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show that while he did not crave the presidency itself, {{he would like to}} do <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could only do by holding that office. A New York Times article cited Thompson's aides as saying on July 18 that he planned to enter the race just after Labor Day, followed by a national announcement tour.|$|E
25|$|Dev {{constantly}} takes Paro's {{love and}} affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant and lazy, which causes his father {{to send him to}} London to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev becoming increasingly more egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes. Paro is shocked to see Dev's chauvinist attitude towards her, even after she claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement on Paro and does not approve of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.|$|E

25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} swear by his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E

Kelley also noted the physicality {{required}} for the film and enjoyed doing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not been asked to do in years. [...] "I was very {{pleased to see that}} he [...] brought it along in fine style," [...] he said. Kelley noted that his own ambition to direct had deserted him after seeing difficulties Nimoy faced directing the previous two Star Trek films.|$|E
500|$|McCain was famously {{accessible}} to the press, using free media to compensate for his lack of funds. [...] As one reporter later recounted, [...] "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." [...] Some McCain aides saw the senator as naturally preferring the company of reporters to other politicians.|$|E

Regarding his similarity to his character, {{he said he is}} [...] "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thinks I also think but I'm able to suppress them." ...|$|E
500|$|William Shatner as James T. Kirk, {{the former}} {{commanding}} officer of the USS Enterprise and an Admiral at Starfleet headquarters, who re-assumes command of the Enterprise, and with it, temporary demotion to his previous rank, captain. When asked during a March 1978 press conference {{about what it would}} be like to reprise the role, Shatner said, [...] "An actor brings to a role not only the concept of a character but his own basic personality, <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is, and both Leonard Nimoy and myself have changed over the years, to a degree at any rate, and we will bring that degree of change inadvertently to the role we recreate." ...|$|E
500|$|Norwood {{said the}} character's {{introduction}} was [...] "trying {{to bring the}} street to Albert Square" [...] and that the street slang the character uses is what {{he grew up with}} himself. He described the character in an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy as [...] " [...] to be a gangsta at times, a caring person, a player, a womaniser, the businessman... There are so many <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wants to be and that shifts depending on the situation," [...] adding that he is quick to solve problems and always has a plan. Additionally, a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website calls him brash, a , confident and a loveable soft-touch.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title track}} and lead single [...] "Eazy-Duz-It", written by MC Ren, {{opens with a}} woman acclaiming Eazy-E's style. Eazy then {{interrupts}} saying [...] "Bitch shut the fuck up, get the fuck outta here." [...] This {{is followed by a}} bass line provided by Dr. Dre. Soon, Eazy begins to rap about himself and <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does. The song declares that Eazy is a [...] "hardcore villain" [...] who collects money from his prostitutes, and feels great when his [...] "pockets are fat." [...] The chorus, repeated three times, states that he [...] "is a gangsta having fun". The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap, including gunshots, and references to several drugs.|$|E
500|$|Although Swift found Motte {{willing to}} print the work, {{he was not}} willing to print Swift's {{additional}} scene. Swift's lack of control over the publication lead to Swift complaining of [...] "mangled and murdered Pages". This was one of many reasons that Swift turned from Motte as his printer and sought a printer willing to produce his complete works without content removal. On 9 October 1733, Swift wrote: [...] "Now, you may please to remember how much I complained of Motts suffering some friend of his (I suppose it was Mr Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely to blot out some <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought might give offence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to the Author's manner and Style, and Intention." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner, {{who listened to}} {{progressive}} rock in his youth, wrote <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> initially withheld from the band, because he felt that his bandmates would not understand him - he described his work as being [...] "way too proggy". Despite his initial doubt, they loved his work when he showed it to them. Thereafter, Heppner began describing the forthcoming record in progressive rock terms during interviews. He told the Whistler Question that it [...] "is a little more musically complex; deeper into the sort of metal side where we started out from", but that [...] "It still sounds like us". He also told Jam! that the new songs were [...] "leaning toward progressive (rock) territory".|$|E

500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E
500|$|Del Toro and Soderbergh both {{attended}} the French premiere in late November 2008, where they took {{questions from the}} press. Del Toro remarked that the [...] "legendary rebel" [...] was still pertinent because [...] "the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fought for in the late 1950s and mid 1960s are still relevant today", adding that [...] "he did not hide behind curtains ... he stood up for the forgotten ones". When asked why he made the film, Soderbergh stated, [...] "I {{needed to make the}} film, and that is a different feeling. I felt like, if I am worth anything, I have to say yes. I can't say no". The following day, the Dubai International Film Festival would describe Soderbergh's narrative as a [...] "magisterial ... compelling experience", with Del Toro's performance as [...] "blue-chip".|$|E
500|$|McCain {{focused on}} the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents. He {{traveled}} on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express. He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of [...] "retail politics", and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds. One reporter later recounted that, [...] "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." [...] On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49percent of the vote to Bush's 30percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.|$|E
