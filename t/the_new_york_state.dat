5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), NY324 {{begins at}} NY384 in eastern Niagara Falls. NY324 heads south, {{overlapping}} with I-190 (the Niagara Section of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Thruway) across the North Grand Island Bridge to Grand Island, where {{it leaves the}} expressway at exit20. However, as signed, NY324 begins {{at the north end}} of Grand Island, where it splits off from the Interstate Highway as Grand Island Boulevard.

5|$|Byron William Brown II (born September 24, 1958) is the 62nd {{and current}} mayor of Buffalo, New York, elected on November 8, 2005 {{and is the}} city's first African-American mayor.

5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano {{announced that he would}} attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns.

5|$|In 2007, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} the county-maintained portion of NY441 near its west end {{was transferred to the}} state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Monroe County.

The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August28. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November26, 2007.

South of the New Jersey border in Bergen County, CR73 intersects the GSP, and in New York, NY45 intersects CR41, which intersects the parkway. Through Chestnut Ridge (where it is known as Chestnut Ridge Road, just as CR73, its southern extension, is in New Jersey), it crosses <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Thruway.|$|E
5|$|Officially, I-190 from I-90 {{north to}} New York State Route384 (NY384) is named the Niagara Thruway and {{is part of}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Thruway system.

5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Senate that laid out the groundwork for a bill which, if passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system once it was able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E

In addition, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at Gantry Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could give permission for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built.
