5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E

5|$|In the {{inertial}} effect, <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> alveolar {{tissue is}} sheared from the heavier hilar structures, an effect similar to {{diffuse axonal injury}} in head injury.

5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E

5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} {{value of}} 400ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common.

Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Carrossier Normand was considered the best carriage horses available. The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses, coincided with a split in the breed. A distinction was made between <b>the</b> <b>lighter,</b> faster horses in the breed, used for sport, and larger horses, used for agricultural work. <b>The</b> <b>lighter</b> horses eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and Anglo-Norman (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier horses became the Norman Cob. In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters. When the original Carrossier Normand became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types, with the Norman Cob continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.|$|E
5|$|Carbonaceous asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% {{of the visible}} asteroids.

5|$|Rhodium is a {{fission product}} of uranium-235; therefore, each {{kilogram}} of fission product contains {{a significant amount}} of <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> platinum group metals including rhodium. Used nuclear fuel is a potential source of rhodium. However, the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (about 10 years). These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.|$|E
