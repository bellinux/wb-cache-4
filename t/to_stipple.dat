40|$|The {{traditional}} artistic {{technique of}} stippling places small dots of ink onto paper such that their density {{give the impression}} of tone. The artist tightly controls the relative placement of the stipples on the paper to produce even tones and avoid artifacts, leading to long creation times for the drawings. We present two non-interactive techniques for generating stipple drawings from grayscale images using weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams. An iterative technique acts on input images directly to produce high-quality stipple drawings and a real-time approach uses precomputed dot distributions <b>to</b> <b>stipple</b> images quickly...|$|E
30|$|This {{problem has}} {{recently}} been tackled by approaches to projecting the high-dimensional data samples onto screen space using dimensionality reduction techniques [16], which have been available {{in the community of}} machine learning. The basic idea behind this approach is to introduce different metrics among the discrete data samples so that we can effectively locate each sample point on the contour tree to be constructed. This has been accomplished by constructing a proximity graph over the data samples to infer its manifold connectivity and then projecting the samples onto the screen space <b>to</b> <b>stipple</b> the contour tree.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} example-based {{approach}} <b>to</b> synthesizing <b>stipple</b> illustrations for static 2 D images that produces scale-dependent results appropriate for an intended spatial output size and resolution. We show how treating stippling as a grayscale process {{allows us to}} both produce on-screen output and <b>to</b> achieve <b>stipple</b> merging at medium tonal ranges. At {{the same time we}} can also produce images with high spatial and low color resolution for print reproduction. In addition, we discuss how to incorporate high-level illustration considerations into the stippling process based on discussions with and observations of a stipple artist. Also, certain features such as edges can be extracted and used to control the placement of dots to improve the result. The implementation of the technique is based on a fast method for distributing dots using halftoning and can be used <b>to</b> create <b>stipple</b> images interactively. We describe both a GPU implementation of the basic algorithm that creates stipple images in real-time for large images and an extended CPU method that allows a finer control of the output at interactive rates. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} procedure for wireframe drawing with {{hidden line removal}} on a graphics card has not changed for a long time: First the filled polygons are drawn, laying down the depth buffer. Next, the polygon edges are drawn as lines with a small depth offset to ensure that polygons do not occlude their own edges. The depth offset is required because the procedure for rasterizing lines is {{not exactly the same}} as the one for rasterizing polygons. Consequently, when rasterizing a polygon edge as a line, a given fragment may have a depth value that is different from when the corresponding polygon itself is rasterized. This leads <b>to</b> <b>stippling</b> artefacts. However, adding an offset is not an ideal solution since this offset can result in disocclusions of lines that should be hidden. Moreover, there is usually stippling in any case near steep slopes in the mesh where a very large offset is sometimes required.

40|$|Introduction The artistic {{tradition}} of stippling {{has a long}} history, particularly {{in the field of}} scientific illustration. Stippled drawings are made up of thousands of small ink dots or <b>stipples</b> that combine <b>to</b> give the impression of continuous tone. The artist can control the placement and size of the <b>stipples</b> precisely <b>to</b> delineate particular details and clarify structures that might be lost in a photograph.

40|$|We {{present a}} fast {{hardware-accelerated}} stippling method {{which does not}} require any preprocessing for placing points on surfaces. The surfaces are automatically parameterized in order <b>to</b> apply <b>stippling</b> textures without major distortions. The mapping process is guided by a decomposition of the space in cubes. Seamless scaling with a constant density of points is realized by subdividing and summarizing cubes. Our mip-map technique enables arbitrarily scaling with one texture. Different shading tones and scales are facilitated by adhering to the constraints of tonal art maps. With our stippling technique, it is feasible to encode all scaling and brightness levels within one self-similar texture. Our method is applied to surfaces extracted from (segmented) medical volume data. The speed of the stippling process enables stippling for several complex objects simultaneously. We consider application scenarios in intervention planning (neck and liver surgery planning). In these scenarios, object recognition (shape perception) is supported by adding <b>stippling</b> <b>to</b> semi-transparently shaded objects which are displayed as context information.

40|$|In this work, {{we focus}} on {{stippling}} as an artistic style and discuss our technique for capturing and reproducing <b>stipple</b> features unique <b>to</b> an individual artist. We employ a texture synthesis algorithm based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of a texture field. This algorithm uses a texture similarity metric <b>to</b> generate <b>stipple</b> textures that are perceptually similar to input samples, allowing us to better capture and reproduce stipple distributions. First, we extract example stipple textures representing various tones {{in order to create}} an approximate tone map used by the artist. Second, we extract the stipple marks and distributions from the extracted example textures, generating both a lookup table of stipple marks and a texture representing the stipple distribution. Third, we use the distribution of <b>stipples</b> <b>to</b> synthesize similar distributions with slight variations using a numerical measure of the error between the synthesized texture and the example texture as the basis for replication. Finally, we apply the synthesized <b>stipple</b> distribution <b>to</b> a 2 D grayscale image and place stipple marks onto the distribution, thereby creating a stippled image that is statistically similar to images created by the example artist. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we present}} an {{automated}} system for creat-ing hedcut illustrations, portraits rendered using small image feature aligned dots (stipples). We utilize edge detection and shading cues from the input photograph <b>to</b> direct <b>stipple</b> placement within the image. Both image edges and isophotes are extracted {{as a means}} of describing the image feature and shading information. Edge features and isophotes are then assigned different priorities, with isophotes being assigned the high-est priority to enhance the depth perception within the hedcut portrait. Priority assignment dictates the stipple alignment and spacing. Finally, stipple size is {{based on the number of}} points and intensity and the gra-dient magnitude of the input image. ...|$|R
50|$|Lloyd's {{method was}} {{originally}} used for scalar quantization, {{but it is}} clear that the method extends for vector quantization as well. As such, it is extensively used in data compression techniques in information theory. Lloyd's method is used in computer graphics because the resulting distribution has blue noise characteristics (see also Colors of noise), meaning there are few low-frequency components that could be interpreted as artifacts. It is particularly well-suited to picking sample positions for dithering. Lloyd's algorithm is also used to generate dot drawings in the style of stippling. In this application, the centroids can be weighted based on a reference image <b>to</b> produce <b>stipple</b> illustrations matching an input image.|$|R

30|$|Poisson disk {{sampling}} is {{an important}} problem in computer graphics and has {{a wide variety of}} applications in imaging, geometry, rendering, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel Poisson disk sampling algorithm based on disk packing. The key idea uses the observation that a relatively dense disk packing layout naturally satisfies the Poisson disk distribution property that each point is no closer to the others than a specified minimum distance, i.e., the Poisson disk radius. We use this property to propose a relaxation algorithm that achieves a good balance between the random and uniform properties needed for Poisson disk distributions. Our algorithm is easily adapted <b>to</b> image <b>stippling</b> by extending identical disk packing to unequal disks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches.|$|R

5000|$|The blocks were skillfully {{carved with}} {{extremely}} fine lines <b>to</b> create <b>stippling</b> and variations in tone. [...] Areas {{intended to be}} printed in a solid colour were marked, and then hatching lines of various thickness were carved into the wood so that colours could be overprinted, creating a variety of hues and tones. To create a blend of colours, blocks were hatched horizontally and diagonally to allow applications of multiple colours that resulted in browns, greens and greys. [...] Gascoigne explains that a [...] "blockmaker would know whether to engrave thin white lines (for an almost solid tone), medium white lines (a mid-tone) or crosshatchings (leaving larger or smaller lozenges of colour to achieve sometimes {{little more than a}} faint tint when seen at a normal viewing distance)."

25|$|On 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to {{engraver}} James Basire of Great Queen Street, at {{the sum of}} £52.10, for a term {{of seven}} years.

No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but Peter Ackroyd's biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries – and then crossed it out. This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared <b>to</b> the flashier <b>stipple</b> or mezzotint styles.

It was usually printed in a neutral tone, such as light grey or terracotta. Often Baxter used more than one colour to ink the key plate - for example, to gradate the image from blue in the sky, to buff in the middle distance and to a darker colour in the foreground; i.e. inking the plate à la poupée. Usually Baxter used aquatint for landscapes and <b>stipple</b> <b>to</b> work faces and figures.|$|R
