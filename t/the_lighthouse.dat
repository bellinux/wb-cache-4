5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up <b>the</b> <b>lighthouse,</b> and Stone got an order to relight <b>the</b> <b>lighthouse.</b> In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When <b>the</b> <b>lighthouse</b> was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. <b>The</b> <b>lighthouse</b> currently uses a VRB-25 lens. <b>The</b> <b>lighthouse</b> switched to solar power in 1988.
