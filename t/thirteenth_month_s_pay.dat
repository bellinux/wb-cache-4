5000|$|Strikingly similar folkloric {{aspects of}} the number 13 have been noted in various {{cultures}} around the world: one theory {{is that this is}} due to the cultures employing lunar-solar calendars (there are approximately 12.41 lunations per solar year, and hence 12 [...] "true months" [...] plus a smaller, and often portentous, <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month).</b> This can be witnessed, for example, in the [...] "Twelve Days of Christmas" [...] of Western European tradition.|$|R

50|$|Various cycles were in {{existence}} for working out exactly which years needed to add a <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month.</b> A nineteen-year cycle, the Metonic cycle was developed at Athens by the astronomers Meton and Euctemon (known to be active in 432 BC), {{could have been used}} to pattern the insertion of leap years to keep the lunar and solar years aligned with some accuracy. There is, however, no sign that any such system was in fact used at Athens, whose calendar seems to have been administered on an ad hoc basis.|$|R
50|$|The {{intercalary}} {{month or}} epagomenal {{days of the}} Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian calendars are a period of five days in common years and six days in leap years {{in addition to those}} calendars' 12 standard months, sometimes reckoned as their <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month.</b> They originated as a periodic measure to ensure that the heliacal rising of Sirius would occur in the 12th month of the Egyptian lunar calendar but became a regular feature of the civil calendar and its descendants. Egyptian and Ethiopian leap days occur in the year preceding Gregorian leap years.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Georgian calendar" [...] was {{proposed}} in 1745 by an American colonist from Maryland writing under the pen name Hirossa Ap-Iccim, the Rev. Hugh Jones.

The treatment of leap year varied from the Gregorian rule, however; and the year would begin closer to the winter solstice. In a later version of the plan, published in 1753, the 13 months were all renamed for Christian saints.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} twenty-first century the {{government}} sought {{to raise more}} revenues from corporation tax. In 2002 it introduced a separate 10% supplementary charge on profits from oil and gas extraction businesses, and Finance Act 2005 contained measures to accelerate when oil and gas extraction business have to pay tax. Instead of paying their tax in four equal instalments in the seventh, tenth, <b>thirteenth</b> and sixteenth <b>month</b> after the accounting period starts, they {{will be required to}} consolidate their third and fourth payments and pay them in the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month,</b> creating a cash flow advantage for the government.Finance (No.2) Act 2005 continued measures specifically relating to life assurance companies.

50|$|Like the Coptic {{calendar}}, the Ethiopic calendar has 12 {{months of}} 30 days plus 5 or 6 epagomenal days, which comprise a <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month.</b> The Ethiopian months begin {{on the same}} days {{as those of the}} Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez. The 6th epagomenal day is added every 4 years, without exception, on August 29 of the Julian calendar, 6 months before the corresponding Julian leap day. Thus {{the first day of the}} Ethiopian year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1900 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually September 11 (Gregorian). It, however, falls on September 12 in years before the Gregorian leap year.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the frequency and characteristics of antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) revealed by polyarthritis. Methods: First we conducted a retrospective single-centre study to assess the frequency of ASS patients who presented with polyarthritis without pulmonary and/or muscle symptoms. Secondly, we conducted a larger, multicentre study in order to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients. Exclusion criteria were the presence of RF, the presence of ACPA and overlap with another CTD. Results: In the single-centre study, polyarthritis was the first manifestation in 12 of 45 ASS patients (27 %). An additional 28 patients were collected for the multicentre study, resulting in a total population of 40 ASS patients who presented with polyarthritis. The mean delay from polyarthritis onset to ASS diagnosis was 27 <b>months</b> (<b>S.</b> D. 40). Pulmonary and muscle symptoms were uncommon at ASS diagnosis (40 % and 32. 5 %, respectively) and were dramatically delayed [mean delay after polyarthritis onset of 41 <b>months</b> (<b>S.</b> D. 53) and 21 <b>months</b> (<b>S.</b> D. 14), respectively]. Mechanic's hands and cutaneous signs of DM occurred in 25 % and 22. 5 %, respectively, with a mean delay of 10 <b>months</b> (<b>S.</b> D. 10) and 31 <b>months</b> (<b>S.</b> D. 21), respectively. When present (32 %), RP was the earliest non-articular manifestation [mean delay 3 <b>months</b> (<b>S.</b> D. 23) after polyarthritis onset]. On HEp- 2 cells, antinuclear and/or cytoplasmic fluorescence was found in 70 % of cases, with specificity for various anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (anti-ARS) antibodies. Conclusion: ASS may be revealed by polyarthritis. To decrease the delay in diagnosis of ASS, pulmonary and muscle symptoms and anti-ARS antibodies might usefully be searched for in seronegative polyarthritis patients, especially in those with RP.

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the impact of}} children temperament, maternal responsiveness and maternal childrearing practices on children externalizing behavior problems and social competence. The study involved 23 child-mother dyads from different socio-economical backgrounds. In the baby's third month after birth, child temperament and maternal responsiveness were evaluated. In the child's <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month</b> after birth, maternal childrearing practices, externalizing behavior problems and child social competence were investigated. Multiple regression analysis revealed that only maternal childrearing practices were significant to explain {{the variance in the}} externalizing behaviors and social competence. The work discusses the relevance of parental practices and the limitations of the evaluation of temperament and maternal responsiveness as predictors for the comprehension of social development...|$|R
