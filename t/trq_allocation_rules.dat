40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new class of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules</b> in network games. Like the {{solution}} theory in cooperative games of how the Harsanyi dividend of each coalition is distributed among a set of players, this new class of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules</b> focuses on the distribution of the dividend of each network. The dividend of each network is allocated in proportion to some measure of each player's effort, which is called an effort function. With linearity of the <b>allocation</b> <b>rules,</b> an <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> is specified by the effort functions. These types of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules</b> are called linear proportional effort <b>allocation</b> <b>rules.</b> Two famous <b>allocation</b> <b>rules,</b> the Myerson value and the position value, belong to this class of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules.</b> In this study, we provide a unifying approach to define the two aforementioned values. Moreover, we provide an axiomatic analysis of this class of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules,</b> and axiomatize the Myerson value, the position value, and their non-symmetric generalizations in terms of effort functions. We propose a new <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> in network games that also belongs to this class of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules.</b> Network games Linear proportional effort <b>allocation</b> <b>rules</b> Axiomatization Myerson value Position value...|$|R

40|$|We study {{real-time}} demand fulfillment for networks {{consisting of}} multiple local warehouses, where spare parts of expensive technical systems are kept on stock for customers with di??erent service contracts. Each service contract specifies a maximum response time {{in case of}} a failure and hourly penalty costs for contract violations. Part requests can be fulfilled from multiple local warehouses via a regular delivery, or from an external source with ample capacity via an expensive emergency delivery. The objective is to minimize delivery cost and penalty cost by smartly allocating items from the available network stock to arriving part requests. We propose a dynamic <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> that belongs to the class of one-step lookahead policies. To approximate the optimal relative cost, we develop an iterative calculation scheme that estimates the expected total cost over an infinite time horizon, assuming that future demands are fulfilled according to a simple static <b>allocation</b> <b>rule.</b> In a series of numerical experiments, we compare our dynamic <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> with the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>rule,</b> and a simple but widely used static <b>allocation</b> <b>rule.</b> We show that the dynamic <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> has a small optimality gap and that it achieves an average cost reduction of 7. 9 % compared to the static <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> on a large test bed containing problem instances of real-life size...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} problem of {{designing}} incentive compatible mechanisms in pure exchange economic environments when agents have incomplete information. The equilibrium concept employed is Bayesian Nash equilibrium {{and the notion of}} implemantation is full implementation, which is stronger than the more commonly employed notion of truthful implementation. An <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> is truthfully implementable if there exists a direct mechanism to which truth telling is an equilibrium and which yields the <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> as its truthful equilibrium outcome. An <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> is fully implementable if there exists mechanism which yields the <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> as its unique equilibrium outcome. More generally, a set of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules,</b> or a social choice set, is fully implementable if there exist a mechanism whose equilibrium outcomes coincide with the set. This stronger notion of implemention avoids the well known problems of multiple equilibria which arise in direct revelation games. We develop a condition, termed Bayesian monotonicity, which we show is necessary for full implementation. An incentive compatibility condition is also necessary. We prove that Bayesian monotonicity and a slightly stronger incentive compatibility condition are sufficient for full implementation when {{there are at least three}} agents. We present several examples of <b>allocation</b> <b>rules</b> which do and do not satisfy our condition.

We show that the <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> is the unique <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> satisfying component efficiency and equal bargaining power under the [DC] condition. If the [DC] condition does not hold, it fails to satisfy component efficiency, but can be shown to be the only <b>allocation</b> <b>rule</b> that satisfies equal bargaining power and quasi-component efficiency which is a weaker property. ...|$|R
