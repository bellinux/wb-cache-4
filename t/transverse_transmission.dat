One of the best ways of reducing break-out noise is use of a sandwich plate shell. This short paper presents an analytical model for prediction of <b>transverse</b> <b>transmission</b> loss of sandwich plate shells. Four-pole parameters of the porous layer are used along with an impedance approach for relating radial velocity of the outer (exposed) metallic layer to acoustic pressure of a plane progressive wave inside the muffler shell.

40|$|Breakout {{noise from}} HVAC ducts is {{important}} at low frequencies, and the coupling between the acoustic waves and the structural waves plays {{a critical role}} in the prediction of the <b>transverse</b> <b>transmission</b> loss. This paper describes the analytical calculation of breakout noise by incorporating three-dimensional effects along with the acoustical and structural wave coupling phenomena. The first step in the breakout noise prediction is to calculate the inside duct pressure field and the normal duct wall vibration by using the solution of the governing differential equations in terms of Green's function. The resultant equations are rearranged in terms of impedance and mobility, which results in a compact matrix formulation. The Green's function selected for the current problem is the cavity Green's function with modification of wave number in the longitudinal direction in order to incorporate the terminal impedance. The second step is to calculate the radiated sound power from the compliant duct walls by means of an "equivalent unfolded plate" model. The <b>transverse</b> <b>transmission</b> loss from the duct walls is calculated using the ratio of the incident power due to surface source inside the duct to the acoustic power radiated from the compliant duct walls.

40|$|Abstract—We {{showed that}} {{creating}} coupling between resonators through <b>transverse</b> electromagnetic <b>transmission</b> line directly tapped into both resonators provides a viable {{solution for the}} design of wideband microwave components where strong coupling values are required. However, more analysis is needed to explain the coupling mechanism and its limitation. In this work, we present the developed equivalent circuit model which is comprised only of lumped elements for comprehensive analysis of the tapped-in coupling between planar or cavity combline resonators. The effects of lumped elements which are in correspondence to physical parameters on coupling value and resonant center frequency are derived. The circuit model predicts that this coupling mechanism by adjusting the design parameters of coupling section simply realizes any required strength of coupling between resonators, i. e., from weak values close to zero up to strong values close to unity. Therefore, wideband filters are easily designed and their bandwidth can be controlled based on inter-resonator tapped-in coupling. This fact is validated through measurements for two-coupled resonators with unloaded resonant frequency of 1. 45 GHz. The bandwidth is extended to 90 % via tapped-in method.

Here, we investigate {{the characteristics of}} two distinct designs, the first one being composed of silicon-dioxide and silicon, and the second one being composed of silicon and sapphire. The suggested quarter-wave plate regime is achieved by the simultaneous optimization of the transverse electric and <b>transverse</b> magnetic <b>transmission</b> coefficients, TTE and TTM, respectively, and the phase difference between these transmission coefficients, such that |TTM| ≅ |TTE| and - ≅ -/ 2. As a result, a unity circular polarization conversion efficiency is achieved atλ 0 = 1. 55 μm for both designs. For the first design, we show the obtaining of unity conversion efficiency by using a theoretical approach, which is inspired by the periodic waveguide interpretation, and rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). For the second design, we demonstrate the unity conversion efficiency by using the results of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations.

40|$|It is now {{recognized}} that regional estimates of myocardial function {{are necessary to}} understand the underlying basis of global cardiac function. Moreover, these regional measures are more meaningful when {{expressed in terms of}} the muscle fiber architecture. In addition, myocardium {{has been shown to be}} a syncytium of myofibers organized into branching laminar "sheets", and recent evidence suggests that the sheet structure is important to systolic wall thickening. Therefore, we studied the regional mechanics of both the normal heart and a model of dyssynchronous activation, and related each to the local fiber and sheet structure. Regional deformation was assessed by implanting beads into the canine heart and imaging them with biplane cineradiography. After the functional data was acquired, fiber and sheet orientations were determined by histological sectioning. In the model of the dyssynchronous heart, myofibers in the late-activated region continued to stretch 44 ms after local tissue activation, and was associated with little stretching perpendicular to the fibers or shearing. Despite occurring primarily during isovolumic systole, this deformation differed markedly from what has been observed during passive inflation, reflecting the state of partial activation. In addition, this dyskinetic contraction did not alter the motion of myocardial sheets relative to wall motion. The relative contributions of sheet lengthening and shearing represented most of the overall wall thickening, and no acute interventions changed this relationship. Therefore, the structural architecture of the ventricular wall appears to be the dominant factor for its regional mechanical function. Using detailed histological measurements of the myocardial sheets, we attempted to derive a mathematical model coupling myofiber tension to active stress transmission through the myocardium. When simulating ventricular mechanics with a finite element model, it appears that a stress component transverse to the myofibers is necessary to replicate experimental measurements. However, the direction of <b>transverse</b> stress <b>transmission</b> is not bounded by the sheet orientation (i. e. only within sheets), so the mechanistic role of the sheets on active contraction remains unclea...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{investigated}} whether microwaves (MWs) of Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) induce changes in chromatin conformation in human lymphocytes. Effects of MWs were studied at different frequencies {{in the range}} of 895 - 915 MHz in experiments with lymphocytes from seven healthy persons. Exposure was performed in <b>transverse</b> electromagnetic <b>transmission</b> line cell (TEM-cell) using a GSM test-mobile phone. All standard modulations included 2 W output power in the pulses, specific absorbed rate (SAR) being 5. 4 mW/kg. Changes in chromatin conformation, which are indicative of stress response and genotoxic effects, were measured by the method of anomalous viscosity time dependencies (AVTD). Heat shock and treatment with the genotoxic agent camptothecin, were used as positive controls. 30 -min exposure to MWs at 900 and 905 MHz resulted in statistically significant condensation of chromatin in lymphocytes from 1 of 3 tested donors. This condensation was similar to effects. of heat shock within the temperature window of 40 degreesC- 44 degreesC. Analysis of pooled data from all donors showed statistically significant effect of 30 -min exposure to MWs. Stronger effects of MWs was found following I-h exposure. In replicated experiments, cells from four out of five donors responded to 905 MHz. Responses to 915 MHz were observed in cells from I out of 5 donors, p < 0. 002. Dependent on donor, condensation, 3 donors, or decondensation, 1 donor, of chromatin was found in response to I-h exposure. Analysis of pooled data from all donors showed statistically significant effect of 1 -h exposure to MWs. In cells from one donor, this effect was frequency-dependent (p < 0. 01). Effects of MWs correlated statistically significantly with effects of heat shock and initial state of chromatin before exposure. MWs at 895 and 915 MHz affected chromatin conformation in transformed lymphocytes. The conclusion-GSM microwaves under specific conditions of exposure affected human lymphocytes similar to stress response. The data suggested that the MW effects differ at various GSM frequencies and vary between donors...|$|R
