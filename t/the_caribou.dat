5|$|Several {{animal species}} inhabit Level Mountain, notably brown bears, wolves, long-tailed jaegers, caribou, {{mountain}} goats, ptarmigans, moose, long-tailed ducks and Stone sheep. Wolves occupy valleys {{and use the}} alpine areas for hunting and denning. Also common in the alpine are brown bears, which are potential predators of newborn caribou calves. <b>The</b> <b>caribou</b> at Level Mountain form a herd {{that is part of}} a larger population ranging west of the Dease River and north of the Stikine River into Yukon. More than 400 caribou were identified at Level Mountain in 1978, although the Ministry of Environment and Parks considered the herd to be declining due to poor recruitment. By 1980, <b>the</b> <b>caribou</b> population was estimated to have been roughly 350.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of <b>the</b> <b>Caribou</b> from service in 2009, No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with eight Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft. The squadron is currently stationed at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, and is responsible for training RAAF pilots to operate King Airs, and performing light transport tasks. It is also believed to have a ground surveillance capability.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded <b>the</b> <b>Caribou</b> as inadequate for the role and preferred a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E
50|$|During the winter, the fur of <b>the</b> Peary <b>caribou</b> becomes {{thicker and}} whiter. In the summer it is shorter and darker. The pelage of <b>the</b> Peary <b>caribou</b> is white {{in winter and}} slate-grey with white legs and under-parts in summer like <b>the</b> barren-ground <b>caribou</b> <b>the</b> Dolphin-Union <b>Caribou</b> population. <b>The</b> Dolphin and Union caribou are {{slightly}} darker.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{woodland}} <b>caribou</b> is <b>the</b> {{largest of}} <b>the</b> North American <b>caribou</b> subspecies.

5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about <b>the</b> <b>caribou</b> herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|In its new incarnation, No.79 Squadron {{continued}} the air defence and training duties for which No.3 Squadron had been responsible at Butterworth. It participated in routine training exercises in Southeast Asia, which included making regular deployments to Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore to train with the Republic of Singapore Air Force. In May 1987 the squadron deployed to Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines {{to participate in}} the annual Cope Thunder exercise with USAF units. It also exercised with No. 77 Squadron's new F/A-18 Hornets in April 1988 when that unit visited Butterworth. <b>The</b> <b>Caribou</b> transport was used to support Australian Army units in Malaysia and also flew training sorties to neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. <b>The</b> <b>caribou,</b> fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.|$|E
50|$|In {{an example}} with wolves and <b>caribou,</b> as <b>the</b> number of <b>caribou</b> {{increases}} while holding wolves constant, <b>the</b> number of <b>caribou</b> kills increases and then levels off. This is because <b>the</b> proportion of <b>caribou</b> killed per wolf decreases as <b>caribou</b> density increases. <b>The</b> higher <b>the</b> density of <b>caribou,</b> <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> proportion of <b>caribou</b> killed per wolf. Explained slightly differently, {{at very high}} caribou densities, wolves need very little time to find prey and spend almost all their time handling prey and very little time searching. Wolves are then satiated and {{the total number of}} caribou kills reaches a plateau.|$|R
50|$|The migratory George River caribou herd (GRCH), in the Ungava {{region of}} Quebec and Labrador in eastern Canada {{was once the}} world's largest herd with 800 000-900 000 animals.

2500|$|The U.S. Air Force opposed <b>the</b> {{introduction}} of <b>Caribou</b> aircraft to Vietnam, {{arguing that the}} C-123 Provider could carry twice the payload over three times the distance. However, {{the difference between the}} two aircraft narrowed under operational conditions, since fuel had to be traded off against payload, and the C-123 required [...] of runway for take-off, as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>Caribou's</b> [...] Once in Vietnam, <b>the</b> <b>Caribou's</b> ability to operate into short, unimproved strips soon proved its worth. Starting in July 1962, Caribous began flying two or three sorties per day into Lao Bao a remote camp that was inaccessible to C-123s. By the end of 1965, there were 88 Caribou aircraft in Vietnam, and the Army was considering a proposal to procure 120 CV-7 Buffalo aircraft – something the Air Force viewed as a costly duplication of the C-123.|$|R

25|$|Chaffee {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>Caribou</b> Mine in 1876. Once {{the most}} famous mine in Colorado, it had been sold to Dutch investors in 1873. But with the mine apparently played out and the Dutch unable to invest enough capital to discover new veins in the mine, Chaffee purchased the property with David Moffat and others. Smith was installed as manager and superintendent of the mine, positions he held until April 23, 1879. On June 25, 1880, <b>the</b> <b>Caribou</b> was consolidated with several other mines. Chaffee, Smith and others formed <b>the</b> <b>Caribou</b> Consolidated Mining Company; Smith was the companies superintendent and general manager until 1881. <b>The</b> <b>Caribou</b> claim quickly began producing large quantities of silver again, and Smith made another fortune.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{populations of}} <b>the</b> North American <b>caribou,</b> for example, many herds in the subspecies, <b>the</b> barren-ground <b>caribou,</b> and some {{woodland}} caribou in Ungava and Labrador, migrate the farthest of any terrestrial mammal, travelling up to [...] a year, and covering [...] Other North American populations, <b>the</b> woodland <b>caribou</b> (boreal) for example, are largely sedentary.

25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from <b>the</b> <b>caribou</b> crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which <b>the</b> <b>caribou</b> can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring <b>the</b> <b>caribou,</b> and stalking <b>the</b> <b>caribou.</b> When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Caribou</b> Mountains are an {{elevated}} plateau {{in the relatively}} flat Albertan north which provide core habitat for an endangered woodland caribou herd.

25|$|Autumn nears, and Tyler hears that <b>the</b> <b>caribou</b> are {{migrating}} south, {{which will}} {{provide an opportunity for}} him to study the concept his superiors want to confirm. Ootek takes Tyler on a two-day hike to where <b>the</b> <b>caribou</b> will be. <b>The</b> <b>caribou</b> show up as predicted and Tyler observes the wolves make several unsuccessful attacks. Tyler helps drive caribou towards the pack, which soon takes one down. Tyler takes a bone and samples the marrow, discovering the dead caribou to be diseased. It confirms that the wolves are not ruthless killers but rather their predation kills off only the weaker caribou.|$|E
50|$|A caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou, {{and other}} trinomials under Rangifer tarandus) is any of several North American subspecies, ecotypes, populations, and herds {{of the species}} Rangifer tarandus, or reindeer. In North America caribou vary in size from the smallest, <b>the</b> Peary <b>caribou,</b> to <b>the</b> largest, <b>the</b> boreal {{woodland}} <b>caribou.</b> <b>The</b> North American range of caribou extends from Alaska, through the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, into the boreal forest and south through the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia and Selkirk Mountains. Barren-ground, Porcupine caribou and Peary <b>caribou</b> live in <b>the</b> tundra, while <b>the</b> shy woodland <b>caribou</b> prefers <b>the</b> boreal forest. Two major subspecies in North America, <b>the</b> Porcupine <b>caribou</b> and <b>the</b> barren-ground <b>caribou,</b> form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds, to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and taiga. The migrations of Porcupine caribou herds are among the longest of any terrestrial mammal. Barren-ground caribou are also found in Kitaa in Greenland, but the larger herds are in Alaska, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.|$|R
