5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 1984 the Yorkshire Club committee, in {{the face}} of this rising pressure, agreed to offer Boycott a {{contract}} for 1984. Several members of the committee, including Trueman, Billy Sutcliffe and Ronnie Burnet, resigned. Of the replacement members, 17 were from the Members 84 Group, and Boycott himself was elected, leaving him with both a position on the team and on the Yorkshire Club committee. The 1984 season was, however, not the most prolific for Boycott. McKinstry records that he scored slowly in several matches: 60 in 52 overs against Somerset; 53 in 51 overs against Hampshire; 17 in 26 overs against Leicestershire; 77 in 67 overs against Sussex. This was coupled with continued friction between himself and both players and club members. In particular, Boycott's place on both the team and the committee led <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> distrust from both – though Boycott denies this – which led to the loss of support from long-term ally Sid Fielden.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of participation motivation on exercise emotion and psychological well-being of marathon participants. The subjects of this study consisted of 241 marathon participants. The result of this study were as follows. First, the subscales of participation motivation, enjoyment, achievement and excitement positively influenced to fun, vigor, pride, achievement, catharsis. And skill development positively influenced to vigor, pride, achievement, catharsis. And external display positively influenced to vigor but, affiliation negatively influenced to vigor, achievement, and catharsis. And amotivation negatively influenced to fun, vigor, pride, catharsis. Second, the subscales of participation motivation, skill development and enjoyment positively influenced <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> flow, <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> competence, <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> self-realization, hedonic enjoyment. achievement and excitement positively influenced <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> flow and hedonic enjoyment, external display positively influenced <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> flow.

25|$|The {{family is}} the agent to which {{capitalist}} production delegates the psychological repression of the desires of the child. Psychological repression is distinguished from social oppression insofar as it works unconsciously. Through it, Deleuze and Guattari argue, parents transmit their angst and irrational fears to their child and bind the child's sexual desires <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> shame and guilt.|$|E
25|$|On a {{personal}} level, there are internal conflicts involving religious beliefs, upbringing, and internalized homophobia in addition <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> fear and isolation. Also, there are potential negative social, legal, and economic consequences such as disputes {{with family and}} peers, job discrimination, financial losses, violence, blackmail, legal actions, restrictions on having or adopting children, criminalization, or in some countries even capital punishment.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} {{that a person is}} fearful of social {{encounters}} with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending {{on the nature of the}} antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause some people to feel as though {{are out of control}} which may lead <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> panic. This misconception of bodily sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity and studies suggest that the people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys than other people, are fives {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed with panic disorder.|$|E
25|$|The British {{began to}} doubt Admiral Darlan's promise to Churchill to {{not allow the}} French fleet at Toulon to fall into German hands by {{the wording of the}} {{armistice}} conditions. In the end, the British attacked French naval forces in Africa and Europe killing 1000 French soldiers at Mers El Kebir alone. This action led <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> animosity and mistrust between the Vichy French and their former British allies. During the course of the war, Vichy France forces lost 2,653 soldiers and Free France lost 20,000.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself {{to be more}} financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being {{less likely to have}} a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events. Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E

5000|$|Because disgust is {{partially}} {{a result of}} social conditioning, there are differences among different cultures in the objects of disgust.

25|$|It is {{expected}} {{for children to}} develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information to make judgments. Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person’s sense of self-worth, self-esteem, <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, {{he or she is}} then diagnosed with gender dysphoria (often termed gender identity disorder or GID).|$|E
25|$|A {{stronger}} form of saudade may be felt towards {{people and}} things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved ones who have died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, {{it can be a}} rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide consolation.|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{are also}} {{especially}} sensitive <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure. Before learning other coping mechanisms, {{their efforts to}} manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury or suicidal behavior. They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, they shut them down entirely. This can be harmful to people with BPD, since negative emotions alert people {{to the presence of}} a problematic situation and move them to address it which the person with BPD would normally be aware of only to cause further distress. People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves.|$|E

25|$|Although the war {{had ended}} in a victory for Japan, Japanese public opinion {{was shocked by the}} very {{restrained}} peace terms which were negotiated at the war's end. Widespread discontent spread through the populace upon the announcement of the treaty terms. Riots erupted in major cities in Japan. Two specific requirements, expected after such a costly victory, were especially lacking: territorial gains and monetary reparations to Japan. The peace accord led <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> distrust, as the Japanese had intended to retain all of Sakhalin Island, but were forced to settle for half of it after being pressured by the United States, with President Roosevelt opting to support Nicholas II's stance on not ceding territory or paying reparations. The Japanese had wanted reparations to help families recover from lost fathers and sons as well as heavy taxation from the government. Without them, they were at a loss.|$|E
25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice can lead <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues {{that humans are}} primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people {{feel that they have}} been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

500|$|Blair {{is largely}} {{motivated}} by matters surrounding family, romance, and ambition. However, her tendency to overachieve can lead <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> paranoia, with dramatic or comical results. In a review for The New Yorker, Janet Malcolm remarked that Blair's issues made her [...] "both a broader caricature {{and a more}} real person" [...] than the other Gossip Girl characters. In a 2009 interview, Gossip Girl creator Cecily von Ziegesar claimed to identify with Blair the most, stating, [...] "She is so unpredictable and dramatic. Such a bitch, but we understand why she is a bitch and we like her anyway".|$|E
500|$|Discussing her character, Barlow {{described}} Mavis as a [...] "soppy thing", adding [...] "she {{had great}} integrity, {{and she was}} a very loyal person. She would stick by her morality. She was a mouse to begin with, and then she met [...] Derek and... she learnt to be quite tough." [...] In Daran Little's book The Coronation Street Story Mavis is described as a [...] "very creative person". She often met men through her creative endeavours, but her status as a spinster often led <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> bitterness, and she resented that her friend Emily had married two men before she had married once. Her lack of male attention led Mavis to be labelled the [...] "eternal virgin" [...] of Coronation Street. The serial's New Zealand broadcaster TVNZ described her as [...] "flighty and romantic".|$|E
500|$|Another {{anti-hunting}} demonstration {{becomes the}} film's focus, {{this time on}} the Isle of Wight. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals had to die to support them. The focus changes to Humboldt penguins, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the [...] "Ceremony of Life", in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply. Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna {{used to measure the}} winds of El Niño for optimal fishing conditions. Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds' fishing habits. This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the salmon run in Alaska, where kodiak bears hunt and fight for prey.|$|E
