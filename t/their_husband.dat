5|$|Women were {{expected}} to obey the will of their father, then <b>their</b> <b>husband,</b> and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources {{that there were many}} deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers. Women were exempt from the annual corvée labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.|$|E
5|$|The shraddha is {{performed}} on the specific lunar day during the Pitru Paksha, when the ancestorusually a parent or paternal grandparentdied. There are exceptions to the lunar day rule; special days are allotted for people {{who died in a}} particular manner or had a certain status in life. Chautha Bharani and Bharani Panchami, the fourth and fifth lunar day respectively, are allocated for people deceased in the past year. Avidhava navami ("Unwidowed ninth"), the ninth lunar day, is for married women who died before <b>their</b> <b>husband.</b> Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife's shraddha. The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures. The fourteenth day is known as Ghata chaturdashi or Ghayala chaturdashi, and is reserved for those people killed by arms, in war or suffered a violent death.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the two consorts is said to denote the dual nature of Murugan, as the god of heaven and earth. Devasena, the celestial wife, is married in a traditional arranged marriage while the earthy Valli is won by Murugan, resulting in a love marriage. The consorts also represent a syncretism between Shaiva and Vaishnava sects, dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu respectively. The son of Shiva, Kartikeya, becomes the son-in-law of Vishnu, due to the marriages. Both the consorts are identified with the soul (Atman), while <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> (pati, Lord) represents God. The marriage of Devasena conveys Vaishnava ideals, where the soul (Devasena) remains detached from God; {{she has her own}} relative autonomy and earns the love of the god by her own merit. In contrast, the Shaiva philosophy says that God is attached to the soul (Valli) and hence he woos her. The Paripatal contains a Tamil panegyric dedicated to Murugan. It praises him as the god who is allowed to have two wives, Devasena – the daughter of Indra and Valli, a hunter princess. Murugan is described to equally spend his time on earth and in heaven. This is also conveyed by his wives, Devasena is a daughter of the heavens, while Valli is an earthly maiden.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{few women}} in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were {{typically}} found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> was employed.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} the {{practice}} in other Christian, European states, women generally assume their husband's surname after legal marriage, and this is passed on to any children the couple may bear.

25|$|There is also {{a tragic}} story linked to this palace. Ishawri Singh, son of Jai Singh who was unwilling to face the {{advancing}} army of Marathas, ended his life humiliatingly by getting bitten by a snake.

25|$|Traditionally, wives {{take the}} surname of <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> after marriage. In modern times, {{in urban areas}} at least, this {{practice}} is not universal and some wives either suffix their husband's surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.|$|E
30|$|This {{support from}} husband {{does not mean}} {{financial}} support. The respondents who had spousal support {{said that it was}} not possible for <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> to fund <b>their</b> businesses because <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> were already burdened with household expenses. In our field visits, we also observed that women entrepreneurs were generally discouraged from doing business if they asked <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> for money.|$|R

25|$|In a divorce, Malagasy women {{traditionally}} {{receive a}} third of the property acquired during their marriage, with <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> receiving the remaining two-thirds; they may also choose to keep their property separate during marriage.

25|$|Queens consort and {{the wives}} of sons of the monarch also have their own {{personal}} coat of arms.

25|$|Daughters have {{no special}} brisures, and {{normally}} use their father's arms on a lozenge, together with any marks of cadency their father may use. This is because English heraldry has no requirement that women's arms be unique. On marriage, they impale their father's {{arms to the}} sinister with those of <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> to the dexter, unless the woman {{happens to be a}} heraldic heiress, into which case her father's arms are borne on an inescutcheon on her husband's arms.|$|E
50|$|Some women {{deal with}} RHS by {{focusing}} their energy on obsessions such as collecting teddy bears, or following a celebrity, {{which they say}} can help them psychologically. They may also ask <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> to stay on at work past retirement age. Many wives do not tell <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> what is happening and this can worsen the stress as <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> may not understand or even realize their wives are RHS sufferers.|$|R

25|$|The {{marriage}} contracts {{represented a}} {{protection for the}} women, {{both in terms of}} financial security if anything were to happen to them or <b>their</b> <b>husband,</b> and in terms of having the liberty to annul the promise of marriage if the man they had chosen proved incompatible. A substantial number of the filles du roi who arrived in New France between 1669 and 1671 cancelled marriage contracts; perhaps the dowry they had received made them disinclined to retain a fiancé with whom they found themselves dissatisfied.|$|E
25|$|Women legally {{have equal}} {{ownership}} rights, although in locations {{along the east}} coast of Madagascar they may be unable to own land. They are allowed to own their own businesses and do not require permission from <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> to acquire land. Their civil liberties are generally well-respected. However, in cases of spousal abuse, women must report the crime themselves in order for the police to act. Although calling the police is rare, women also have a traditional right known as misintaka that allows them to leave their husbands and live with their families.|$|E
25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage {{in dialog with}} <b>their</b> <b>husband,</b> some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country.

40|$|This thesis explores how the {{battered}} woman attachment to her abusive partner impacts on her {{interactions with the}} legal system and non-legal resources. This qualitative research project is based on in-depth interviews conducted with seven abused women who procured interdicts {{in terms of the}} Prevention of Family Violence Act 133 of 1993 to restrain <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> from assaulting them. The research reviews the nature of abuse suffered by the participants, their psychological attachments to <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> and <b>their</b> patterns of help-seeking in relation to the law and non-legal resources. Two main theoretical frameworks, psychoanalysis and feminism inform this study. The study found that the participants retained unrealistic hopes that <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> would reform and become loving, caring partners, and that they treated <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> with care and sympathy despite their husbands’ often brutal behaviour towards them. The findings suggest that the women’s behaviour towards <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> was the product of two reality distorting psychological defences, splitting and the moral defence which they used to preserve their attachments to their abusive partners. These defences intersected with rigid patriarchal prescriptions of femininity which dictate that women should be stoically caring towards <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> and should hold relationships together no matter what the cost to themselves. The participants interactions with the legal system and with non-legal sources of help were structured by their reliance on splitting and the moral defence, and by the dictates of patriarchal ideology. Whilst it is undoubtedly true that at one level the participants sought help to get protection from abuse, the study shows that their help-seeking was motivated by their conflicting desires to punish and reform <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b> The participants sought help in ways which enabled them to strike a compromise between expressing their anger at <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> whilst simultaneously preserving their psychological attachments to them. The study concludes that the women’s interactions with the law and with other helping resource reflect their attempts to preserve their paradoxical attachments to <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> and to stabilise their own fragile sense of self and gender identit...|$|R
25|$|The Act gave married women, for {{the first}} time, a right to their children. However, because women needed to {{petition}} in the Court of Chancery, in practice few women had the financial means to petition for their rights. The Matrimonial Causes Act reformed the law on divorce, amongst others making divorce more affordable, and established a model of marriage based on contract. The Married Women's Property Act 1870 allowed married women to inherit property and take court action on their own behalf. The Act granted married women in the UK, {{for the first}} time, a separate legal identity from <b>their</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{under the}} Immigration Act, 1971, {{the concept of}} patriality or right of abode was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth {{citizens}} had the right of abode in the UK only if they, <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act, 1981.|$|E
