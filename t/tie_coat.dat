60|$|But John Baptist, widely staring, muttering {{a number}} of invocations and ejaculations, tremblingly backing into a corner, {{slipping}} on his trousers, and <b>tying</b> his <b>coat</b> by the two sleeves round his neck, manifested an unmistakable desire to escape by the door rather than renew the acquaintance. Seeing this, his old prison comrade fell back upon the door, and set his shoulders against it.|$|R

60|$|Rose, on her part, {{saw another}} man {{of grace and}} power. She saw every detail of his dress. His dark, {{sensitive}} face, and splendid slope of his shoulders, the exquisite neatness and grace of his collar and <b>tie</b> and <b>coat.</b> But in his eyes was something that moved her, drew her. She felt something subtile there, refinement and sorrow, and emotions she could only dimly feel.|$|R
25|$|During Life on Mars, Hunt often wore a beige camel {{coat with}} {{a white shirt and}} tie, grey suit and {{trousers}} with white slip on shoes, typical of the period. His top shirt button is always undone and his tie always hangs halfway down his chest in an untidy, disheveled fashion.

6000|$|She {{had tried}} to {{convince}} herself that the village, with its fresh air, its lakes for fishing and swimming, was healthier than the artificial city. But she was sickened by glimpses of the gang of boys from fourteen to twenty who loafed before Dyer's Drug Store, smoking cigarettes, displaying [...] "fancy" [...] shoes and purple <b>ties</b> and <b>coats</b> of diamond-shaped buttons, whistling the Hoochi-Koochi and catcalling, [...] "Oh, you baby-doll" [...] at every passing girl.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from these}} three {{compulsory}} safety items, FEI rules allow riders to dress {{as they please}} in the cross-country phase. [...] Riders wear anything from traditional hunter green or navy blue, to tie-dye, zebra stripes, or fluorescent colours.

Light-weight rugby or polo shirts are the most commonly worn shirt style, usually without a stock or <b>tie.</b> Riding <b>coats</b> are generally not worn.|$|R
60|$|As he said it, he rose, shook himself, {{scratched}} himself, <b>tied</b> {{his brown}} <b>coat</b> loosely round his neck by the sleeves (he had previously {{used it as}} a coverlet), and sat down upon the pavement yawning, with his back against the wall opposite to the grating.|$|R
50|$|Concrete and {{foam plastic}} domes {{generally}} {{start with a}} steel framework dome, wrapped with chicken wire and wire screen for reinforcement. The chicken wire and screen {{is tied to the}} framework with wire <b>ties.</b> A <b>coat</b> of material is then sprayed or molded onto the frame. Tests should be performed with small squares to achieve the correct consistency of concrete or plastic. Generally, several coats are necessary on the inside and outside. The last step is to saturate concrete or polyester domes with a thin layer of epoxy compound to shed water.|$|R

6000|$|He {{rolled up}} his {{trousers}} {{and made him}} kick off his slippers, took off his collar and <b>tie</b> and <b>coat</b> and vest, slipped a black skirt over his head, {{and put on a}} red flannel bodice and a body over the same. He made him take off his all too characteristic spectacles, and clapped the bonnet on his head. [...] "You might have been born an old woman," [...] he said as he tied the strings. Then came the spring-side boots--a terrible wrench for corns--and the shawl, and the disguise was complete. [...] "Up and down," [...] said Cossar, and Bensington obeyed.|$|R
5000|$|In Seasons 6-8, Ryan {{seems to}} be devoid {{of many of his}} former morals and ambitions. He doesn't care to work, reads poetry and initiates various {{creative}} projects. He switches clothing, from wearing fanciful scarves, fake glasses, suspenders, bow <b>ties,</b> trench <b>coats,</b> etc. and tries to create an [...] "unsolvable attitude". He manages to stay at Dunder Mifflin but his current position is unspecified, Michael mentions that he works there full-time in WUPHF.com. Many of the staff, most notably Jim and Pam, note Ryan's ineptitude as an employee and that he sponges off his parents by living with them and driving his mom's car.|$|R

5000|$|He was {{a regular}} in the Lower East Side party scene and in 2005 URB {{magazine}} {{put him on the}} cover with a headline reading [...] "Interpol + The Cult of Carlos D". Interviews tied in with the band's third album, Our Love to Admire, in 2007, however, marked a change in Dengler's attitude. Quotes from the time hint at a growing dissatisfaction with touring and the band in general. He described his switch from leather corset-belts, slicked hair, gun-holster and combat boots to bolo <b>tie,</b> waist <b>coat,</b> his natural curls and mustache as freeing: [...] "Everyone stopped recognizing me on the street. I forgot what it's like just to be a normal person. It felt so good." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rebar cages are {{fabricated}} {{either on}} or off the project site commonly {{with the help of}} hydraulic benders and shears. However, for small or custom work a tool known as a Hickey, or hand rebar bender, is sufficient. The rebars are placed by steel fixers [...] "rodbusters" [...] or concrete reinforcing iron workers, with bar supports and concrete or plastic rebar spacers separating the rebar from the concrete formwork to establish concrete cover and ensure that proper embedment is achieved. The rebars in the cages are connected by spot welding, tying steel wire, sometimes using an electric rebar tier, or with mechanical connections. For <b>tying</b> epoxy <b>coated</b> or galvanised rebars, epoxy coated or galvanized wire is normally used, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Kurpie men in {{the north}} wore long brown <b>coats</b> <b>tied</b> around the waist with a red sash. They wore white linen shirts and white {{trousers}} which are fastened at the bottom with straps from the Kurpie shoes which they wore. Men from the north can be distinguished from {{men in the}} south since men in the north wear dark brown top hats and men from the south wear small black caps.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{depicts a}} larger-than-life Abraham Lincoln wearing a beard {{and sitting on}} a rock with his head slightly bowed forward and his arms resting on his knees.

Lincoln is wearing a bow <b>tie,</b> vest, long <b>coat</b> and boots - his right boot extends just beyond {{the edge of the}} base. His watch chain is visible on his vest.|$|R
60|$|The {{four young}} men had risen, and {{stood looking at}} Alvina and Madame. The room was small, rather bare, with horse-hair and white-crochet antimacassars and a {{linoleum}} floor. The table also {{was covered with a}} brightly-patterned American oil-cloth, shiny but clean. A naked gas-jet hung over it. For furniture, there were just chairs, arm-chairs, table, and a horse-hair antimacassar-ed sofa. Yet the little room seemed very full--full of people, young men with smart waistcoats and <b>ties,</b> but without <b>coats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ballroom/Smooth dances are {{normally}} danced to Western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following {{the line of}} dance. In competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a white tie affair, with full gowns for the ladies and bow <b>tie</b> and tail <b>coats</b> for the men; though in American Smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter tuxedos, vests, and other creative outfits.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the first}} blush of day I {{was awakened by}} the loud halloo of the guide, who, with a voice of a Stentor, gave vent to a [...] "Leve! Leve! leve!" [...] that roused the whole camp {{in less than two}} minutes. Five minutes more sufficed to finish our toilet (for, be it known, Mr Carles and I had only taken off our <b>coats),</b> <b>tie</b> up our blankets, and embark. In ten minutes we were once more pulling slowly up the current of Hayes River.|$|R
60|$|The man {{for whom}} these great {{preparations}} {{had been made}} stood in {{the entrance of the}} restaurant, waiting for the woman who was giving her cloak to the vestiaire. He was tall and thin, dressed rather severely, with a black <b>tie</b> and short <b>coat,</b> a monocle which hung from his neck with a black ribbon. His face was unusually long, his eyes deep-set, his mouth set firm on a somewhat protuberant jaw, with lines at the corners which somehow suggested humor. When he saw Henri he nodded.|$|R

A few tents and small trees can be seen in the background...|$|R

5000|$|Around the Cultural Revolution, almost {{anything}} {{seen as part}} of traditional culture would lead to problems with the Communist Red Guards. Items that attracted dangerous attention if caught in the public included jeans, high heels, Western-style <b>coats,</b> <b>ties,</b> jewelry, cheongsams, and long hair. [...] These items were regarded as symbols of bourgeois lifestyle, which represented wealth. Citizens had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as torture or beatings by the guards. [...] A number of these items were thrown into the streets to embarrass the citizens.|$|R
5000|$|He became {{assistant}} {{keeper of}} the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1959. In 1967, aged 32, he was appointed its director, a post he held until 1973. He set about transforming its conservative image {{with a series of}} extrovert shows, including [...] "600 Cecil Beaton portraits 1928-1968." [...] Dedicated to the culture of the 1960s and 1970s, Sir Roy went on to amuse audiences at the V&A in 1974 with his collection of fedora hats, kipper <b>ties</b> and maxi <b>coats.</b> By regularly introducing new exhibitions he doubled attendance.|$|R
