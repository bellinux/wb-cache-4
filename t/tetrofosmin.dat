50|$|Tc-99m <b>tetrofosmin</b> {{is rapidly}} {{taken up by}} {{myocardial}} tissue and reaches its maximum level in approximately 5 minutes. About 66% of the total injected dose is excreted within 48 hours after injection (40% urine, 26% feces). Tc-99m <b>tetrofosmin</b> is indicated for use in scintigraphic imaging of the myocardium under stress and rest conditions. It is used to determine areas of reversible ischemia and infarcted tissue in the heart. It is also indicated to detect changes in perfusion induced by pharmacologic stress (adenosine, lexiscan, dobutamine or persantine) in patients with coronary artery disease. Its third indication is to assess left ventricular function (ejection fraction) in patients thought to have heart disease.No contraindications are known for use of Tc-99m <b>tetrofosmin,</b> but care {{should be taken to}} constantly monitor the cardiac function in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.Patients should be encouraged to void their bladders as soon as the images are gathered, and as often as possible after the tests to decrease their radiation doses, since the majority of elimination is renal. The recommended dose of Tc-99m <b>tetrofosmin</b> is between 5 and 33 millicuries (185-1221 megabecquerels). For a two-dose stress/rest dosing, the typical dose is normally a 10 mCi dose, followed one to four hours later by a dose of 30 mCi. Imaging normally begins 15 minutes following injection.|$|E

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the results of exercise-rest technetium- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with those of thallium- 201 reinjection at rest after exercise-redistribution imaging in the same patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Methods. Within I week, 33 patients with chronic myocardial infarction and LV dysfunction underwent exercise-rest <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT and TI- 201 reinjection at rest after exerciseredistribution imaging. In each patient, regional <b>tetrofosmin</b> and TI- 201 activity was quantitatively measured in 22 myocardial segments. Regional LV function was assessed in corresponding segments by echocardiography. Results. Agreement in the evaluation of regional perfusion status between <b>tetrofosmin</b> and Tl- 201 imaging was observed in 78 % of the 726 total segments, with a ~: value of 0. 61. In segments with normal function at echocardiography (n = 436), no difference between TI- 201 and <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake was observed. In hypokinetic segments (n = 138), exercise <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake was lower (P <. 01) as compared with exercise TI- 201 activity, whereas no difference was observed between <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake at rest as compared with TI- 201 activity on redistribution and reinjection images. In segments with severe functional impairment (akinetic or dyskinetic, n = 152), <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake on exercise images was reduced (P <. 01) as compared with exercise TI- 201 activity; furthermore, <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake at rest was lower (P <. 01) as compared with T 1 - 201 activity on both redistribution and reinjection images.

40|$|Technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) <b>tetrofosmin</b> {{is widely}} used in nuclear {{medicine}} as a diagnostic agent for myocardial perfusion and as a tumor imaging agent. As a parenteral preparation it requires an evaluation of its pharmacokinetics and stability in-vivo. Since 99 mTc has a short half-life and is only available in very low concentrations, {{it is impossible to}} characterize its chemical properties and presence in the body. Due to this reason, only technetium- 99 (T 1 / 2 = 5 × 105 years), which is available in macro quantities, or natural rhenium can be used for this purpose. In this study rhenium- 188 (188 Re) <b>tetrofosmin</b> will be synthesized and applied, because non-radioactive Re can be easily obtained. Synthesis and radiochemical purity analysis of carrier-added 188 Re-tetrofosmin were carried out as a model to study the in-vivo stability of technetium- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin.</b> Rhenium- 188 was used as a tracer to identify the formation of rhenium <b>tetrofosmin.</b> Rhenium gluconate was synthesized first prior to the formation of rhenium <b>tetrofosmin.</b> The quality of labeling for both rhenium gluconate and rhenium <b>tetrofosmin</b> was analyzed using paper- and thin-layer chromatography, respectively. Rhenium gluconate can be synthesized with high labeling yield within 1 hour, whereas rhenium <b>tetrofosmin</b> was synthesized both in room temperature and in an elevated temperature with various tetrofosmin-to-rhenium mole ratios. The results showed that heating at 95 oC led to a higher yield of more than 90 % within 30 minutes. Rhenium <b>tetrofosmin</b> could be produced in high radiochemical purity using an excess of <b>tetrofosmin</b> with mole ratio of 2000.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{compared}} dipyridamole technetium- 99 m (Tc- 99 m) <b>tetrofosmin</b> and thallium- 201 (Tl- 201) single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging {{with respect}} to the detection rate of perfusion abnormalities in 26 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD). Background. Experimental studies have shown that myocardial extraction of Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> is lower than that of Tl- 201 at high flow rates, resulting in less severe defects with vasodilator stress. It is uncertain whether this results in a lower sensitivity than Tl- 201 for detecting coronary stenoses with vasodilator stress in patients. Methods. Twenty-six patients with CAD underwent both dipyridamole Tl- 201 and Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT. Tomographic images were scored for initial defects and the presence of reversibility. Defect magnitude was computer quantitated. Results. Of the 26 patients, 25 had defects on both Tl- 201 and Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT images. Of 340 segments analyzed, 102 had defects by Tl- 201 and 92 by Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> (p = NS). Whereas Tl- 201 detected 27 fixed defects in 12 patients, Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> identified 37 fixed defects in 14 patients (p = NS). In contrast, Tl- 201 identified more reversible and partially reversible defects than did Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> (89 vs. 55, p = 0. 002). The average defect magnitude (percent normal) was similar for defects concordantly graded as fixed (38 ± 3. 0 % for Tl- 201 vs. 42 ± 4 % [mean ± SEM] for Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin,</b> p = NS). The average defect magnitude for defects concordantly graded as completely reversible was significantly more severe on Tl- 201 than on Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> (49 ± 3 % vs. 58 ± 3 %) SPECT images. A significantly greater defect magnitude for Tl- 201 was also found for defects concordantly classified as partly reversible (30 ± 4 % for Tl- 201 vs. 45 ± 5 % for Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin).</b> Conclusions. With dipyridamole stress, 1) at least one defect was seen on both Tl- 201 and Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT images; 2) Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT identified fewer reversible defects than did Tl- 201, but showed a similar number of fixed defects; 3) the magnitude of reversible defects seen on Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> images was less, whereas fixed defects were similar for both tracers; 4) reversible defects seen on Tl- 201 and not on Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT images were predominantly regions perfused by mild coronary stenoses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cardio-renal {{pathophysiology}} {{is increasingly}} investigated in cardiovascular disease but, to our knowledge, no single tool {{is available for}} simultaneous imaging and quantitation of cardiac and renal function. Previous observations with Sestamibi suggested that 99 mTc tracers may offer the possibility to combine renal and cardiac imaging. Aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the feasibility of a cardio-renal single shot study using <b>Tetrofosmin.</b> Methods. Thirtheen patients (8 M, 5 F, mean age 65 yr) scheduled for double-day Gated SPECT for cardiac purposes underwent rest dynamic renal imaging after injection of 370 MBq of <b>Tetrofosmin.</b> All patients gave their consent to undergo also a DTPA scintigraphy (74 MBq) 1 week apart from Gated SPECT. In 6 patients a <b>Tetrofosmin</b> renal study was also made with adenosine infusion. In all studies, a first pass transit was followed by a renographic phase. For both tracers the renal uptake index as a percentage of the injected dose (UI), the separate renal uptake as a percentage contribution of each kidney to total uptake (SRU), time to peak (TP) and the retention index (20 min activity/peak activity, RI) were calculated. Results. Qualitative analysis: compared to DTPA, <b>Tetrofosmin</b> allowed a better renal visualization with a clear upslope phase and peak followed by a washout phase frequently delayed on the right side due to an increasing liver activity. Quantitative analysis: compared to DTPA, <b>Tetrofosmin</b> showed a higher renal uptake on both kidneys (p< 0. 01); no significant differences were appreciable for SRU or TP whereas a higher right kidney RI was found with <b>Tetrofosmin.</b> <b>Tetrofosmin</b> UI significantly correlated with DTPA UI (p< 0. 001), serum creatinine (p< 0. 05) and the Doppler index of renal vascular resistances (p< 0. 02). <b>Tetrofosmin</b> and DTPA SRU were also significantly correlated (p< 0. 01). In the 6 patients who underwent the adenosine study a reduction of <b>Tetrofosmin</b> UI (p< 0. 02) was observed when compared with the baseline study. Conclusions. In cardiovascular patients <b>Tetrofosmin</b> allows the simultaneous investigation of cardiorenal function and vascular reactivity. These relevant information could be combined at low cost in patients referred for <b>Tetrofosmin</b> cardiac studies, especially in those in whom renal perfusion abnormalities may reveal a worse cardiovascular risk profile and prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the value of attenuation correction of technetium 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for the detection of myocardial viability. Methods and Results. A head-to-head comparison between resting Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) SPECT was performed. Both the noncorrected and attenuation-corrected Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT images were compared with the FDG images that served as the reference for viability. Consecutive patients (n = 33) with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction were included. Segmental Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> and FDG data were displayed in polar maps (17 -segment model), and the segments were normalized to peak activity by use of the 4 D-MSPECT software program. Segments with normalized FDG activity greater than 50 % were considered viable. A similar cutoff value to assess viability was used for the noncorrected and attenuation-corrected Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> images. Regional contractile function was determined from the gated Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> images and scored as normokinesia, hypokinesia, or akinesia/dyskinesia. Of all segments, 482 (85 %) were viable on FDG SPECT. Of these, 427 (89 %) were classified as viable with noncorrected Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin.</b> Thus 55 (11 %) were underestimated with noncorrected Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT; these segments were mainly located in the inferior and inferoseptal regions. Attenuation correction changed the classification of 39 (70 %) of the underestimated segments to viable. By use of attenuation correction, the agreement between Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> and FDG imaging improved from 84 % to 90 %. Similar observations were made when the analysis was restricted to the dysfunctional segments. Conclusion. The addition of attenuation correction to Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> SPECT significantly improved detection of myocardial viability in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, although minimal underestimation of viability remained as compared with FDG SPECT imaging...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{investigate}} whether <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake {{is affected by}} myocardial viability as has been noted for 201 Tl and sestamibi, we analyzed the initial and delayed distribution patterns of <b>tetrofosmin</b> in a rat coronary artery occlusion-reperfusion model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Animals were intubated and ventilated, and their arterial pressures were monitored. A left thoracotomy was performed. After 1 -hour occlusion and 1 -hour reperfusion of a major branch of the circumflex artery, 201 Tl and either <b>tetrofosmin</b> or sestamibi were injected intravenously. Radiolabeled microspheres were used to document the area at risk and reperfusion. Five minutes or 1 hour after administration of the diffusible tracers, the animals were killed. Tracer distribution was determined by use of segmental tissue analysis, and tissue viability was determined by use of histochemical staining. Both the initial and delayed retention of <b>tetrofosmin</b> were sensitive to myocardial viability, as shown by significantly lower uptake (30 +/- 14 %) and retention (24 +/- 12 %) of <b>tetrofosmin</b> in the nonviable segments compared with the viable segments. In addition, the initial myocardial distribution of <b>tetrofosmin</b> {{was similar to that}} noted for 201 Tl, but after 1 hour of tracer circulation, the <b>tetrofosmin</b> tissue distribution appeared unchanged compared with the initial regional blood flow distribution. This is in direct contrast to our present observations of significant 201 Tl redistribution and some changes in sestamibi distribution as well. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical implication of these observations suggests that initial and delayed imaging after <b>tetrofosmin</b> administration would reflect both the initial regional blood flow pattern and myocardial viability...|$|E

40|$|AIM: Digestive {{activity}} {{can interfere with}} the interpretation of myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography using sestamibi or <b>tetrofosmin.</b> Compared with sestamibi, the liver clearance of <b>tetrofosmin</b> is more rapid, but its absolute cardiac uptake is lower. In this study, the activity of sestamibi and <b>tetrofosmin</b> was quantified after exercise or pharmacological stress and at rest to objectify the biokinetic differences and to evaluate {{whether there is a}} correlation between quantitative measurements and the visual assessment of image quality. METHODS: Left ventricular activity and five ratios (R 1 -R 5) of cardiac to adjacent extra-cardiac activity were quantified in 204 sestamibi (68 exercise stress/ 56 pharmacological stress/ 80 rest) and 221 <b>tetrofosmin</b> (67 exercise stress/ 59 pharmacological stress/ 95 rest) studies. Image quality was assessed by a three-point score (1, good; 2, moderate; 3, poor) and correlated with the heart to left supra-diaphragmatic region (R 1) and heart to right supra-diaphragmatic region (R 2) ratios. RESULTS: The mean left ventricular activity was higher for sestamibi, especially at rest (sestamibi, 0. 21 ± 0. 05 counts/pixel/injected MBq; <b>tetrofosmin,</b> 0. 16 ± 0. 042 counts/pixel/injected MBq; P< 0. 001). By contrast, most ratios were higher with <b>tetrofosmin,</b> particularly for the exercise stress and rest studies. Using the three-point quality scoring, more sestamibi than <b>tetrofosmin</b> studies were scored as 3 (12. 2 % versus 6. 3 %), also particularly for the exercise stress and rest studies. A highly significant relationship was found between decreasing R 1 and R 2 and an increasing quality score, regardless of the radiopharmaceutical used (P values between 0. 02 and < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lower cardiac uptake, the more rapid liver clearance of <b>tetrofosmin</b> than sestamibi significantly improves the ratios of cardiac to digestive activity, especially after exercise or at rest.

However, no data are available comparing 99 mTc-labeled <b>tetrofosmin</b> adenosine and exercise tests in the same patients. Methods and Results. The results of adenosine and exercise 99 mTc-labeled <b>tetrofosmin</b> myocardial tomography were compared in 41 patients (37 men and four women; mean age 53 + 8 years) with suspected or known CAD who underwent coronary angiography. All patients were submitted, on separate days, to three injections of 99 mTc-labeled <b>tetrofosmin</b> (740 MBq intravenously) : one at rest, one during bicycle exercise, and one during adenosine infusion (140 ~g/kg/min for 6 minutes with injection of 99 mTc-labeled <b>tetrofosmin</b> at 4 minutes). A total of 902 myocardial segments were analyzed quantitatively. One patient had normal coronary vessels, 19 patients had single-vessel CAD, 12 patients had two-vessel CAD, and nine patients had three-vessel CAD (> 50 % coronary stenosis) on coronary angiography. Adenosine induced a significant increase in heart rate (88 + 16 beats/min at peak vs 72 + 11 beats/min at rest; p < 0. 01). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was not significantly different after adenosine infusion compared with rest. Double product was 22931 + 7039 at peak exercise and 11229 + 3413 after adenosine (p < 0. 01). Agreement on the presence of abnormal single-photon emission computed tomography by adenosine and exercise was 100 % by quantitative analysis. In all segments a significant relationship between exercise and adenosine 99 mTc- 99 m-labeled <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake was observed (r = 0. 90; p < 0. 001).

The data were used to derive a relative distribution of quantitative <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake ratios for the various organs. Using anthropometric data, body sizes were determined for a standard obese male and female NURBS-based cardiac torso (NCAT) phantom. <b>Tetrofosmin</b> uptake ratios were modeled in the obese phantoms and projection data were generated.

40|$|Background. Renal {{function}} {{is a strong}} predictor of cardiovascular prognosis and cardiorenal disease is increasingly investigated. Cardiorenal Scintigraphy with the perfusion tracer 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin was proposed as a single combined examination allowing the simultaneous investigation of heart and kidney in cardiovascular patients, including hypertensives at risk of both cardiac and renal disease (Fommei, 2009). The renal uptake index (UI) of <b>Tetrofosmin</b> {{as a percent of}} the injected dose was used as a renal diagnostic parameter and found to be related to clinical and scintigraphic (99 mTc-DTPA) indexes of cardiorenal severity. Aim of the study. Here we tested 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin renal diagnostic validity in hypertensive patients in a comparison with 123 I-Hippuran scintigraphy as a gold standard for renal function. Patients and Methods. 22 hypertensive patients (5 F, 17 M, age range 46 - 79 yrs) were scheduled for both 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin cardiac G-SPECT and 123 -I Hippuran scintigraphy in their diagnostic workup. As previously described, cardiorenal scintigraphy consisted in a dynamic renal acquisition after <b>Tetrofosmin</b> bolus injection, followed by standard cardiac G-SPECT. Hippuran scintigraphy was performed in a separate day following standard procedures. Renal images and renograms were obtained and renal uptake was calculated for each kidney both in <b>Tetrofosmin</b> and Hippuran scintigraphies. Results. <b>Tetrofosmin</b> UI (mean 13. 13 ± 6. 9 SD%) resulted lower than Hippuran UI (23. 24 ± 12. 80 % (p< 0. 001) reflecting different intrarenal kinetics.

40|$|Animal {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a lower myocardial extraction fraction and earlier "roll-off' in the myocardial uptake of Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> compared to Tc- 99 m sestamibi, giving rise to concerns that the consequent reduction in defect contrast could result in underestimation of perfusion defects by Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin.</b> There are no large studies comparing the two agents in {{the same group of}} patients. It has been suggested that differences between these two agents are most likely to manifest in the setting of mild to moderate coronary disease, where defect contrast is already relatively low, and during the use of vasodilator stress where the higher rates of myocardial blood flow induced make tracer roll off more likely. Accordingly, in this prospective, two-centre (UK and Canada) study, 81 carefully chosen patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis (50 - 90 % stenosis in up to 2 major epicardial vessels, no previous myocardial infarction) and 7 patients with less than 5 % probability of coronary disease underwent dipyridamole SPECT imaging with Tc- 99 m sestamibi and Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> in random order. Images were interpreted blindly by a panel of independent, experienced readers, and were analysed visually to determine the presence of perfusion defects and reversibility, and quantitatively using the CEqual programme to detemine defect extent and severity. Two additional readers undertook a second blinded reading of the scans of patients recruited by the UK centre. These were also analysed using the Liege quantitative programme. This subgroup analysis was intended to serve as a control to corroborate the results of the larger study. Tc- 99 m sestamibi detected reversible perfusion defects in 365 segments compared with 285 by Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> (p< 0. 0001), and demonstrated a larger extent of perfusion defect as determined by the percentage of left ventricular myocardium involved (mean +/- SD, 15. 8 %+/- 12. 3 and 12 % +/- 11. 9 for Tc- 99 m sestamibi and Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin,</b> respectively, p< 0. 03). The defect /normal wall ratio was significantly lower with Tc- 99 m sestamibi (0. 60 +/- 0. 15) compared to Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> (0. 73 +/- 0. 14, p = 0. 01) indicating better defect contrast with Tc- 99 m sestamibi. In addition, Tc- 99 m sestamibi more often correctly predicted the presence of disease in more than one coronary artery.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether baseline/nitrate technetium 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) mismatch may provide equivalent clinical information. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 23 patients (aged 62 +/- 10 years, 19 men) with previous myocardial infarction (16 anterior, 4 inferior, and 3 anterior plus inferior) and postischemic heart failure (gated SPECT [G-SPECT] ejection fraction, 26 % +/- 8 %). All patients underwent Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> G-SPECT at rest and after nitrates (intravenous isosorbide dinitrate, 0. 2 mg/mL, 10 mL/h) as well as a fluorine 18 fluoro- 2 -deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) PET scan. Regional wall motion analysis was performed with quantitative G-SPECT (QGS). Myocardial dysfunction was defined as a regional QGS score of 2 or greater. Regional perfusion was assessed by quantitative perfusion score (QPS) providing percent Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake in a 20 -segment model. Semiquantitative analysis of FDG uptake was performed by use of polar maps generated by Siemens ECAT HR + software. In areas with a perfusion rate lower than 80 %, PET viability was identified by a normalized FDG percent uptake/baseline Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> percent uptake ratio greater than 1. 2. We analyzed 460 segments; 298 (64 %) were dysfunctional by QGS analysis. Of these, 170 were viable by PET imaging whereas 128 were nonviable. Regional Tc- 99 m <b>tetrofosmin</b> uptake was higher in viable than in nonviable segments both at rest (60 % +/- 24 % vs 42 % +/- 12 %, P <. 01) and after nitrates (67 % +/- 20 % vs 41 % +/- 18 %, P <. 01). According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a cutoff value of 63 % for resting as well as post-nitrate G-SPECT provided the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of myocardial viability (67 % and 72 % at rest and after nitrates, respectively). When the same algorithm used for the comparison with PET (normalized nitrate percent uptake/baseline percent uptake) was applied to G-SPECT, we obtained the highest agreement with PET (accuracy, 93 %; sensitivity, 95 %; specificity, 92 %).

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the myocardial retention of sestamibi, <b>tetrofosmin,</b> and Q 12 in a porcine model. Methods: We used a pig model with (n 5 6) or without (n 5 3) coronary occlusion. Each pig received a simultaneous injection of sestamibi and either <b>tetrofosmin</b> (group 1, n 5 5) or Q 12 (group 2, n 5 4) labeled with either 99 mTc or 95 mTc (physical half-life, 61 d; photon energy, 204 keV) during pharmacologic vasodilation. Absolute myocardial retention of each tracer was calculated from the myocardial tracer activity and arterial input function. Results: The plot of all three tracers versus flow achieved a plateau at a higher flow range.
