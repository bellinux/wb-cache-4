5|$|A {{very active}} trough of low {{pressure}} persisted along the equator {{in the middle}} of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140° W to 140° E. An organized circulation developed near Palmyra Atoll on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward. Though very late in the season, warm temperatures to the south of the Hawaiian Islands due to the strongest El Nino in many years allowed the disturbance to develop into Tropical Storm Iwa on November 19 while located about 970miles (1,760km) southwest of the southernmost point in Hawaii. The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm. After <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, Iwa began slowly intensifying, and on November 23 after <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-northwest Iwa strengthened into a hurricane while located 580miles (930km) southwest of the southern tip of Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|With {{winds of}} 60mph (95km/h) and strengthening, the {{subtropical}} storm initially drifted northeastward. On December 13, a ridge of high pressure to its north forced the storm southeastward, {{and the following}} day the storm turned to the south after an upper-level cold-core low developed over the system. A break in the ridge resulted in the storm <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, with its forward motion accelerating to nearly 40mph (65km/h). After <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest on December 17, the high pressure system again halted its northward movement, leaving the storm drifting south-southeastward. Conditions favored further strengthening, and the subtropical storm reached 70mph (115km/h) winds on December 18. Satellite imagery estimated the storm attained hurricane status on December 19, and a day later ship near the center reported winds of 75mph (120km/h). Based on the wind report, {{as well as a}} minimum central pressure of 980 mbar and a well-defined eye, the storm was classified as Hurricane Lili while located 730miles (1,180km) east of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} western Gulf of Mexico on September14 and moved eastward. The storm produced heavy seas across the region, which damaged two small boats.

After maintaining peak winds for about five days, the storm weakened, by which time it curved to the northeast. On September20, it moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and later crossed the state.

5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2.

The twelfth {{and final}} tropical cyclone of the season, Gordon {{formed in the}} southwestern Caribbean on November8. Without strengthening, the storm made landfall on Nicaragua. Later on November 10, the storm began to strengthen as it tracked further from land, and it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon, the seventh named storm that season. Gordon also made landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba while a minimal tropical storm. It entered the southwestern Atlantic while resembling a subtropical cyclone. By the time it entered the Gulf of Mexico, it was fully tropical again. Tropical Storm Gordon later crossed the Florida Keys, and <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast it made landfall in Fort Myers, Florida. Gordon strengthened after it re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, becoming a hurricane on November 17.
