[...] "The new Bond {{has been widely}} {{described}} in feature stories as {{a throwback to the}} Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. You get the feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E
500|$|Shadows on the Wall's Rich Kline {{noted that}} the storyline was [...] "compelling and eye-opening" [...] and praised the actors as [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "committed to getting the truth out." [...] He was {{impressed}} with the [...] "lively and fascinating sense of local culture" [...] that dominated the film. Kline, who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, was mainly concerned with the film's [...] "rather clumsy" [...] direction and screenwriting. Maseko directed with [...] "energy and verve," [...] though his [...] "struggles to capture the human drama" [...] led to the impression that Drum was [...] "a clunky TV movie, with awkward camera angles, wonky editing and clumsy sound recording." [...] Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which [...] "echoes with cliches, while contrived plotting put characters into situations <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> but they feel corny and movie-like." [...] Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film, though added that [...] "maybe this helps us begin to understand what life must have been like under such an oppressive government." ...|$|E

[...] Significantly, even the keyboard parts are played live in the studio, with The Quietus noting that the [...] "interplay between electronics and amps is comparatively untouchable." [...] Spin noted that [...] "here more than on any previous Neurosis LP, he [...] commandeers his bandmates' sustained chords and snail-paced tempos and fills the space with smartly tinted textures," [...] which reference Joy Division, Ennio Morricone, and Jarboe.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, The Tom Leykis Show {{was briefly}} heard on an {{irregular}} basis in New York City on WNEW. Leykis {{was moved to}} afternoons from nights to replace the recently fired Opie and Anthony of The Opie and Anthony Show. Leykis later reflected on his comparative lack of success in the New York market, explaining that the station never truly got behind him, [...] "We were talking to [...] about the show being on the station on a regular basis. He said, [...] "This show will never work in New York." [...] Now, <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> or {{it may not be}} true {{but how do you know}} until the people have had a chance to listen to it?".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the plot}} was highly publicised, {{details of the}} trial have never been released. In 1794 the British {{government}} failed {{to prove that the}} London Corresponding Society (of which Despard was a member) was treasonous. [...] Because of this, many of the details focused on the attempted assassination of Despard's plot, as this is what prosecutors focused on. Informers claimed that John Wood offered to post himself sentry with a canon to fire at the King's carriage as it was going to what was then called Buckingham House. It is unlikely that Despard favoured this plan, as it was viewed as very dangerous and still hoped that men in high places, such as the politician Francis Burdett, would agree to non-regicidal changes in government. Though <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> evidence produced at the trial suggests that Despard did indeed consider regicide.|$|E

Novak frequently visited {{his alma mater}} and interacted with students, establishing a scholarship in his name to support English and rhetoric majors in 1992. He spoke at the college’s May 1998 commencement, urging graduates to use their education as a [...] "bulwark against tyranny." [...] Novak {{also served as a}} Radford Visiting Professor of Journalism for Baylor University in 1987. He was the 2001 winner of the National Press Club’s 'Fourth Estate Award' for lifetime achievement in journalism as well. Novak appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary on political strategist Lee Atwater, [...] In the film, Novak says [...] "He tried to get me to write about Governor Dukakis having psychiatric problems but it really was a slander. He thought my weakness was that if I could get an exclusive story, I would jump at it, bite at it and not be as careful as I should be. <b>That</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> but I was careful enough not to get involved in that one." ...|$|E
