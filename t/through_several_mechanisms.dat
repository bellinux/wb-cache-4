5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants.

5|$|The {{facility}} {{attempts to}} minimize its environmental impact <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> including minimizing area usage. Energy consumption {{is reduced by}} using recirculating excess heat to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating. Waste is minimized through purchase planning and recycling; the remaining waste is compressed and transported away from the Antarctic. Fuel is handled {{in such a way}} that even small spills are minimized. In 2016 a solar PV plant with 7.3 kilowatt peak has been installed on one of the roof tops. It serves as a pilot installation for the declared middle term target of reducing the oil consumption of the research station significantly, by extending the solar PV plant over the next few years.|$|E
25|$|At high doses, MDMA induces a neuroimmune {{response}} which, <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> {{increases the}} permeability of the blood-brain barrier, thereby making the brain {{more susceptible to}} environmental toxins and pathogens. In addition, MDMA has immunosuppressive effects in the peripheral nervous system and pro-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system.|$|E

40|$|Recognition of polymicrobial infections is {{becoming}} important for understanding differential host responses to environmental exposures, vaccines, {{as well as}} therapeutics. Citrobacter rodentium is a well-characterized model of infectious colitis with particular usefulness for modeling human diarrheal disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Infection with Helicobacter hepaticus is subclinical and persistent in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, but causes disease in susceptible strains and immunodeficient mice. To test the hypothesis that subclinical persistent infection modulates the host response to diarrheal disease a polymicrobial mouse model utilizing H. hepaticus and C. rodentium was developed and characterized. Concurrent infection {{has been shown to}} modulate disease outcome <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R
25|$|This can be {{attempted}} <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The {{most direct}} {{strategy is to}} simply buy up {{a large percentage of}} the available commodity offered for sale in some spot market and hoard it.

25|$|Upstream, PI3K/AKT {{signalling}} is deregulated {{through a}} variety of mechanisms, including overexpression or activation of growth factor receptors, such as HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and IGFR (insulin-like growth factor receptor), mutations in PI3K and mutations/amplifications of AKT. Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling. In many cancers the PTEN expression is decreased and may be downregulated <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> including mutations, loss of heterozygosity, methylation, and protein instability.|$|E
25|$|The female sexual {{response}} system {{is complex and}} even today, not fully understood. The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions that {{have been linked to}} menopause include lack of desire and libido; these are predominantly associated with hormonal physiology. Specifically, it is the decline in serum estrogens that causes these changes in sexual functioning. Androgen depletion may also play a role, but currently this is less clear. The hormonal changes that take place during the menopausal transition have been suggested to affect women's {{sexual response}} <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> some more conclusive than others.|$|E
30|$|Methadone is {{commonly}} administered for chronic pain relief {{and treatment of}} opioid dependence. Concurrent with its increased consumption, toxicities and fatalities have increased.

50|$|Energy {{imbalance}} {{and weight}} loss can disrupt menstrual cycles <b>through</b> <b>several</b> hormonal <b>mechanisms.</b> Weight loss can cause elevations in the hormone ghrelin which inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarial axis. Elevated concentrations of ghrelin alter the amplitude of GnRH pulses, which causes diminished pituitary release of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).|$|R
25|$|Arsenic {{disrupts}} ATP production <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> At {{the level}} of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits lipoic acid, which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase. By competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system organ failure. The organ failure is presumed to be from necrotic cell death, not apoptosis, since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid is an excitotoxin in the CNS. It reaches {{pathological}} {{levels in}} response to inflammation in the brain, which activates resident microglia and macrophages. High levels of quinolinic acid can lead to hindered neuronal function or even apoptotic death. Quinolinic acid produces its toxic effect <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> primarily as its function as an NMDA receptor agonist, which triggers a chain of deleterious effects, but also through lipid peroxidation, and cytoskeletal destabilization. The gliotoxic effects of quinolinic acid further amplify the inflammatory response. Quinolinic acid affects neurons located mainly in the hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex, due to the selectivity toward quinolinic acid by the specific NMDA receptors residing in those regions.|$|E

[...] In E. coli, the best-characterized bacteria, DNA replication is regulated <b>through</b> <b>several</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> including: the hemimethylation and sequestering of the origin sequence, the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the levels of protein DnaA.
