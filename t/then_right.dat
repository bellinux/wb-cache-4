25|$|Cheek kissing in the Arab {{world is}} {{relatively}} common, between friends and relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between {{a male and}} female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and sister, or if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities {{in some of the}} more liberal Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia, where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the Arab diaspora. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: one on the left cheek, <b>then</b> <b>right,</b> and then left between relatives.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, British {{publisher}} Scion published dozens {{of science fiction}} (sf) novels by John Russell Fearn under the pseudonym [...] "Vargo Statten". [...] These were very successful, and Scion decided {{to take advantage of}} the popularity of the name by issuing a monthly sf magazine. [...] The first issue was dated January 1954 and was edited by Alistair Paterson. [...] The target audience included long-time fans: Scion had notified established science fiction fan groups before the launch, so there was a letter column in the first issue, and a column by Vincent Clarke, a well-known fan, covered fan news. [...] Scion's stated intention was to have at least 10% of the magazine devoted to the sf fan community, and also to publish only stories by British writers. [...] Paterson's editorial policy for the fiction was aimed at younger readers, which led him to return a story by Brian Aldiss with a request for a rewrite to make it more suitable for teenaged readers. [...] Aldiss, <b>then</b> <b>right</b> at the start of his career, refused, and never submitted a story to the magazine again. [...] The stories in the early issues were mostly written by Fearn, E.C.
