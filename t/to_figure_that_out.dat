Connolly said [...] "I don't know. I've been trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out.</b> It {{was back in the}} day. People, for five minutes called us progressive, and then it was nu-metal. Then, all of a sudden, we were playing alternative metal.

5000|$|Rundle {{played the}} lead role of Fiona Griffiths, a young detective constable in the Sky Living two-part crime series Talking to the Dead, based on the eponymous novel by Harry Bingham. It was adapted by Golden Globe Award-nominee Gwyneth Hughes. On playing Fiona Griffiths, Rundle did some {{research}} on Cotard’s Syndrome in order to portray Griffiths accurately. She agrees that her character in the series is a little [...] "loopy": [...] "Well, yes. Part {{of the mystery of}} the show is trying to work out {{what is going on with}} her. You know that there is a history of trauma there and you are trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out.</b> It is being fed to you in little bits. She has a history of mental health issues too, which gives her an affinity with the dead." ...|$|E
50|$|Angel {{makes his}} way to his new home, a {{basement}} apartment beneath a ground floor office, where he finds Doyle waiting for him. Doyle introduces himself, explaining he's half human, half demon, then recaps the story of Angel's life, ending with his recent, painful breakup with the Slayer and his subsequent move to L.A.. Doyle explains that Angel's isolation, combined {{with the fact that he}} recently drank human blood, puts him at serious risk of relapse. Doyle gets visions from The Powers That Be (accompanied by debilitating headaches) regarding people whose lives Angel must touch; true redemption lies not just in saving lives, but in saving souls as well. Doyle concludes by handing over a scrap of paper on which he's jotted information about a young woman named Tina. When Angel asks why Tina needs him, Doyle replies that getting involved in her life enough <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> is Angel's first order of business.|$|E

5000|$|Krishna {{actually}} {{was in a}} body as a person ... What makes it complicated is, if he's God, what's he doing fighting on a battlefield? It took me ages to try <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out,</b> and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot. So {{this is the point}} - that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body ... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, [...] "Please Krishna, you drive the chariot" [...] because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides ... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield. That's why we say [...] "Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna", asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.|$|E

5000|$|After five stories Steve White {{was brought}} in to help address some problems. According to editor John Tomlinson [...] "Ever since [...] "War Machine" [...] in 1989, readers had been {{confused}} as hell about who is Friday and whether he was the original Rogue. I told Steve <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> and explain it" [...] This led to a two-year-long run on the series for the writer, although there was a move to hand the series to Mark Millar which only resulted in a three-part story. During this period Friday met both Judge Dredd, in an issue-length story, and the original Rogue Trooper, the latter being intended to settle the issue of their origins and connections. Unfortunately, according to Tomlinson [...] "Steve came up with a fairly watertight explanation, but it was enormously complicated and probably confused far more people than it enlightened." [...] That story also brought in Venus Bluegenes, a G.I. Doll, who would appear in one more story before her appearance in the final story to feature Friday. Dan Abnett, co-author for that story, was complimentary of White's work, [...] "Steve had such a great feel for military goings on," [...] however, this couldn't overcome intrinsic problems with the story as [...] "he was absolutely hamstrung by the weight of continuity." [...] The two characters disappeared into a black hole and have not reappeared since.|$|E

50|$|When {{horrified by}} the sight of fallen Spiders, Miguel and Lady Spider find Toei Spider-Man's Leopardon and decide to repair it. Unable to return to 2099 with Daemos still there, they {{transport}} the remains of the robot to Lady Spider's universe of Earth-803. Miguel tells Lady Spider that Leoparddon needs radiation in its arsenal for their next confrontation with the Inheritors due to their weakness. But as they get to work on the robot, Norman Osborn-803 calls his fellow Six Men of Sinistry to take out Lady Spider in revenge for her thwarting their attempted kidnapping of the mayor. Unwilling to waste any time, Miguel leaps into action, clawing at Green Goblin, bluffing him into thinking that he cut his throat, when he deliberately missed, forcing the Goblin to retreat. Miguel gets hit in the back by Electro and is thrown out the window, while Lady Spider takes cover inside Leopardon's head as Electro unleashes a lightning storm at her. The robot then reactivates, causing its right hand and foot to disable Electro and Vulture respectively, before Miguel fires upon Octopus with Kraven's ship, knocking him out cold. As they take Leopardon to rejoin the other Spiders, Lady Spider wonders where Harold Osborn will take her to dinner. Miguel assures her that she'll have plenty of time <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> after they return from Loomworld and finish the Inheritors once and for all.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "heavily choreographed" [...] fight scene between Lundgren and Jaa {{was planned}} over [...] "a month or two". It was rehearsed {{for two weeks}} and took a further week to film. Due to Lundgren's role as co-producer, the cast {{had a lot of}} freedom to improvise their scenes. Jaa filmed his fight scenes without using wirework or CGI. He felt this would give his {{character}} [...] "more depth" [...] and allow him to better display his acting abilities. Jaa also performed all of his own stunts. Lundgren stated he was [...] "very impressed" [...] by Jaa's acting and fighting abilities. In his opinion, the majority of people wouldn't be able to perform Jaa's stunts without using wirework. [...] "In a less sophisticated movie they'll just fight forever, on this rooftop, that rooftop, the street, on the bus - I mean, it's okay to do that in a comedy. But in a real fight? That's why the Rocky movies are great: there's a story within the fights. Who wins, who's on top at the beginning, and then this changes, and then that one gets injured and the other one takes over; there's a beginning, middle, and an end to every fight. That's what you need. You need <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> before you throw the moves in there." [...] — Lundgren discussing the choreography in 2015. According to White, his fight scenes with Jaa were in [...] "large part" [...] choreographed ten minutes before filming. On the contrary, Jaa described it as something they were practicing [...] "right up until the shoot". He recalled that while they were rehearsing the sequences and moves together [...] "quite extensively" [...] for a [...] "number of days", they didn't rehearse them on the film set. The fight was filmed in three takes.|$|E
40|$|The {{expressive}} {{features of}} music {{can influence the}} velocity of walking. So far, studies used instructed (and intended) synchronization. But is this velocity effect still present with non-instructed (spontaneous) synchronization? <b>To</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out,</b> participants were instructed to walk in their own comfort tempo on an indoor track, first in silence and then with tempo-matched music. We compared velocities of silence and music conditions. The results show that some music has an activating influence, increasing velocity and motivation, while other music has a relaxing influence, decreasing velocity and motivation. The influence of musical expression on the velocity of self-paced walking can be predicted with a regression model using only three sonic features explaining 56 % of the variance. Phase-coherence between footfall and beat did {{not contribute to the}} velocity effect, due to its implied fixed pacing. The findings suggest that the velocity effect depends on vigor entrainment that influences both stride length and pacing. Our findings are relevant for preventing injuries, for gait improvement in walking rehabilitation, and for improving performance in sports activities...|$|E

30|$|Only because I {{felt like}} the teacher was doing all of the {{cognitive}} work, {{and just kind of}} pulling like words, instead of really saying, well, “What are you trying to tell me? What do you mean by that?” They were asking questions, she was answering it. It was that back and forth. And then in the second video I said it was a high level, and level 4, only because I think the small group work really helped. I think if it was just the classwork, maybe she wouldn’t {{have been able to do}} that. I think adding that small group work really brought it up, because then students were actually looking at data, analyzing data, making observations, comparing data between different results from different crosses. They were struggling with the information, so I thought there was a high cognitive demand, because, you know, they were really trying—all of them really started to notice, well, all of these PCRs and all of these western blots are the same. Why don’t they all look the same? So they’re really struggling, trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out.</b> So I thought that that made it high level. And the teacher wasn’t just answering the questions.|$|E
40|$|If there’s {{inheritance}} of traits from parents to children, or from “mother cell ” to “daughter cells ” in mitosis, then some thing must be passed from parent to child. We know today {{that this thing}} is DNA, {{in the form of}} chromosomes. However, someone needed <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out!</b> In the 1930 s and 1940 s, scientists were very interested in identifying the biochemical nature of the “transforming principle. ” The candidate molecules were DNA, RNA, and protein. These molecules were candidates because we knew that nuclei contained chromosomes which are associated with phenotypes (think Morgan’s fruit fly eye color experiments where eye color corresponded to the X- or Y- chromosome content of the fly cells), and isolated nuclei are composed mostly of protein, DNA, and RNA. Most scientists at the time were leaning toward protein being the genetic material because it is the most molecularly diverse of the three. The investigations into the chemical nature of genetic material were initiated by one very important paper from 1928, written by Fred Griffith at the British Ministry of Health. Griffith was studying the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important pathogen in the 1920 s. Question 1. Why would studying S. pneumoniae be an important topic in the 1920 s? Some forms of S. pneumoniae cause disease (pneumonia) ...|$|E
40|$|The general {{configuration}} of the SPS engine was 20, 000 pounds of thrust, with a chamber pressure of 100 psi and specific impulse (Isp) of 314. 5. The very large nozzle had an area ratio of 62. 5 : 1 (exit area to throat area). The propellants were nitrogen tetroxide (also known as N 2 O 4 and nitrous oxide) and A- 50. A- 50 was a hydrazine family fuel. Aerojet developed it for the Titan Missile Program when they went with Titan II, to store it in the launch silos. They wanted the highest performance they could get. N 2 H 4 was just pure hydrazine, which doesn't take low temperature very well. In fact, it freezes about like water. We started adding unsymmetrical-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) to the hydrazine {{until such time as}} it would meet the environmental specifications the Air Force needed for Titan II. It turned out it s roughly a fifty-fifty mix. We still had to be careful with that fuel because the two fluids didn't mix very well chemically. We had to spray the two fluids through some special nozzles to get them to emulsify with each other into a single fluid. If we ever got it too cold or froze it, the hydrazine separated back out. Then, if we tried to run the engine, things could go boom in the night. The inlet pressure was only 165 pounds per square inch absolute (psia), but we needed at least forty psi pressure drop across the injector just to get some kind of stable flow. It was a whole new game for some of us. We didn't have much supply pressure to work with. It had the aluminum injector to keep the weight down. That was a couple feet in diameter, and we didn't have a lot of propellant to cool it. In fact, we had to use both propellants to keep the injector cool. There were twenty-two ring channels in the injector. Specification required 750 seconds duration, or fifty engine restarts during a flight. There were several first flight things we accomplished with the engine. It was the first ablative thrust chamber of any size to fly. (See Slide 6, Appendix G) There were no liners in it. It was just straight ablative material. It took us a while <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>out.</b> It was a throat-gimbaled engine, {{and it was the first}} engine to fly with columbium (also known as niobium, used as an alloying element in steels and superalloys) in the nozzle...|$|E
