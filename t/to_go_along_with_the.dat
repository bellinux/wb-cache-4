5|$|Lancaster’s main ally was Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Warwick was {{the most}} fervently and {{consistently}} antagonistic of the earls, and remained so until his early death in 1315. Other earls were more amenable. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, was Gaveston’s brother-in-law and stayed loyal to the king. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, would later {{be one of the}} king’s most central supporters, yet at this point he found the most prudent course of action was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reformers. Of the barons, at least Robert Clifford and William Marshall seemed to have royalist leanings.|$|E
5|$|Rastignac refuses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plot, balking at {{the idea}} of having someone killed to acquire their wealth, but he takes note of Vautrin's machinations. This is a lesson in the harsh realities of high society. Before long, the {{boarders}} learn that police are seeking Vautrin, revealed to be a master criminal nicknamed Trompe-la-Mort ("Cheater of Death"). Vautrin arranges for a friend to kill Victorine's brother, in the meantime, and is captured by the police.|$|E
5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that a fictitious {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, so their presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality. The next day the German Chancellor had cabled Wagenheim, rejecting the idea and demanding that the Ottomans immediately join the war. The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for a fictitious sale. The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government {{that it would be}} best <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|Abby {{is in love}} again, {{but then}} finds out that Charles is the front {{for a group of}} thugs wanting to build a marina at Lotus Point for drug trafficking. Abby pretends <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{marriage}} and accepts a two million dollar wedding gift from Charles. After the ceremony she has the marriage annulled, but keeps the money. After this, Abby marries Greg Sumner. It isn't love, but rather a political marriage. Abby forms another company, Morikame, in order to buy Lotus Point. When her former partners find out and threaten to have her arrested for fraud, she donates Lotus Point to the government as a wildlife preserve. Abby goes after a political appointment that Greg wants, and leaves Knots Landing to be a trade representative in Japan. Abby later forms another illegal company with Nigel Treadwell, and tries to take over the Sumner Group, but her plan fails. She moves back into her old house on the cul-de-sac.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{appears to}} have been unimpressed by this plan. She felt that marrying the son of a count diminished her {{imperial}} status and was probably also unhappy about marrying someone so much younger than she was; Matilda was 25 and Geoffrey was only 13. Hildebert, the Archbishop of Tours, eventually intervened to persuade her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> engagement. Matilda finally agreed, and she travelled to Rouen in May 1127 with Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitz Count where she was formally betrothed to Geoffrey. Over {{the course of the next}} year, Fulk decided to depart for Jerusalem, where he hoped to become king, leaving his possessions to Geoffrey. Henry knighted his future son-in-law, and Matilda and Geoffrey were married a week later on 17 June 1128 in Le Mans by the bishops of Le Mans and Séez. Fulk finally left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine.|$|E

5|$|At the hospital, {{the family}} learns that Peter's {{condition}} {{has a big}} chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They learn that the only other option besides the daily procedures is that one must give up one of their kidneys to Peter. Lois volunteers to give up one of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover {{that he has the}} same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are smaller than human's, the donation requires both kidneys. If the procedure was successful, Brian would lose his life. Brian decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> procedure to save Peter's life. Reluctant to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman reveals that he is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys. He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog kidneys would work, meaning that Brian would have died for nothing. Thus, Brian's life is spared.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid {{out of both}} of his {{portfolios}} {{and made}} him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets {{and that the government}} create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield's Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago's commodity market. Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government had little choice but <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool.|$|E

5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and {{the one or two}} players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> games, and a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E
