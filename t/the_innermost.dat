5|$|<b>The</b> <b>innermost</b> ward {{encloses}} an area immediately {{south of}} the White Tower, stretching to {{what was once the}} edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century Hen Domen, <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s. The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as Windsor Castle. Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers– located at the corners of <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> ward's wall along the river– began around 1220. They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively. The earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from HenryIII's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A great hall existed in the {{south of the}} ward, between the two towers. It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by HenryIII at Winchester Castle. Near Wakefield Tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king's apartments. <b>The</b> <b>innermost</b> ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward. Between 1666 and 1676, <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed. The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the Crown Jewels moved to Martin Tower.|$|E

5|$|Metis is <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> of Jupiter's {{four small}} inner moons. It orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of ~128,000km (1.79 Jupiter radii) within Jupiter's main ring. Metis's orbit has very small eccentricity (~0.0002) and inclination (~ 0.06°) relative to the equator of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2010, astronomers {{announced}} a fourth planet, designated Gliese876e.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>innermost</b> {{cortical}} layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly {{adjacent to}} the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.|$|E
5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron; however, this does not happen if <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. <b>The</b> <b>innermost</b> portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking <b>the</b> <b>innermost</b> finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has shown}} igneous {{rock from the}} Devonian period (around 400 million years ago) intrudes into the {{surrounding}} metamorphic schists; the intrusions {{take the form of}} a series of concentric ring dikes. <b>The</b> <b>innermost</b> of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, is composed of andesite and basaltic lavas.|$|E
