5|$|E. Between and {{including}} the 1982 and 1990 seasons, the Swedish football championship was decided not by the final standings in Allsvenskan, but by a play-off held following the Allsvenskan season, which pitted the four best-placed clubs {{against each other in}} a two-legged cup format. The Malmö FF team won Allsvenskan five <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> between 1985 and 1989, but had to contest these play-offs each time to claim the national title. Though they won the play-offs in 1986 and 1988, they failed to do so in 1985, 1987 and 1989, and therefore were not Swedish champions those years.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, the Swedish FA {{experimented with}} the {{competition}} format: between 1982 and 1990, the Swedish championship {{was given to}} the winners of a play-off held between the four best-placed Allsvenskan teams. A championship league was contested by the top six clubs in the league in 1991 and 1992. The pre-1982 format was then restored. Malmö FF won Allsvenskan a record five <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> between 1985 and 1989, but only won the play-offs in 1986 and 1988. After a brief successful period in the mid-1990s, the club began to decline in Allsvenskan and found themselves relegated in 1999, the first time since 1936 they were out of the top division. The team were relegated to the newly created Superettan.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, Malmö FF won Allsvenskan five <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> between 1985 and 1989, {{but were}} only awarded the Swedish {{championship}} in 1986 and 1988 as the club {{failed to win}} the newly constructed play-off stage during 1985, 1987 and 1989. The side won the cup four times during the decade. The 1990s was the first decade in the club's history since the first title in 1944 where it failed to win any league or cup titles. The team's best performance that decade was second place in Allsvenskan in 1996, and runners-up in the cup the same season. Cavalli-Björkman retired as chairman of Malmö FF after the 1998 season, leaving the post to Bengt Madsen, whom club members elected in the banker's place.|$|E

5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, acting {{upon the}} idea {{proposed}} by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist {{and editor of}} L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created a tournament for the champions teams around Europe, under invitation, that would eventually become what today {{is known as the}} UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.|$|E

Del Potro's serve was subsequently broken three <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> and he suffered a back injury, which caused his retirement. In his second Grand Slam of the year, the French Open, he was eliminated in the second round by Simone Bolelli in four sets. In June, he reached the semifinals of the Ordina Open, losing to eventual winner and top seed David Ferrer in straight sets.
