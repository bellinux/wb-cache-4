5|$|A {{memorial}} statue {{was erected}} for Whale in 2002 {{on the grounds}} of a new multiplex cinema in his home town of Dudley. The statue, by Charles Hadcock, depicts a roll of film with the face of Frankenstein's monster engraved into <b>the</b> <b>frames,</b> and the names of his most famous films etched into a cast concrete base in the shape of film canisters.|$|E
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The main {{railway station}} {{building}} {{includes a clock}} tower, imitation Tudor chimneys and carved heads in <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> of every window. There is a small British Transport Police station within the building.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> data <b>frame</b> is {{initially}} processed by FIFO buffer which buffers some bytes {{if there are}} any downstream processing delays. Then, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> flows into <b>frame</b> store. Next, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> is stored in SRAM via SRAM interface. <b>The</b> associated <b>frames</b> with <b>the</b> appropriate <b>frame</b> context information are retrieved via Register I/O so that <b>the</b> data <b>frame</b> in <b>the</b> SRAM can be monitored. When the last word of <b>the</b> data <b>frame</b> is written into <b>the</b> SRAM, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> store will send a control signal to make frame remove informed, which tells <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> remove to begin reading <b>the</b> data <b>frames</b> in <b>the</b> SRAM.|$|R
50|$|The {{locations}} {{of all other}} fields in <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> can be defined relative either {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> as negative offsets of the stack pointer, or relative to the top of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> below, as positive offsets of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> pointer. <b>The</b> location of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> pointer itself must inherently be defined as a negative offset of the stack pointer.|$|R
30|$|Collapse {{diagram of}} <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> larger knee length {{was above the}} {{collapse}} diagram of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> smaller knee length, i.e., <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> larger knee length more probable to collapse than <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> smaller knee length.|$|R
5|$|Three of <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> {{received}} {{showed the}} Earth as a tiny {{point of light}} in empty space. Each frame had been taken using a different color filter: blue, green and violet, with exposure times of 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds respectively. The three frames were then recombined to produce the image that became Pale Blue Dot.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons attached to <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge {{in order of}} thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> and {{pictorial}} {{areas of}} the diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> {{may require}} disassembly. Disassembly can reveal <b>the</b> <b>frame’s</b> {{construction}} methods {{and give the}} conservator insight to the structural integrity of <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> Disassembling <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> will also allow the conservator to assess damaged ornamentation and easily replicate necessary elements.|$|R
50|$|In {{this process}} {{there are three}} <b>frames</b> related in <b>the</b> {{intrinsic}} rotation sequence. Let's denote <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> 0 as <b>the</b> initial <b>frame,</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> 1 after <b>the</b> first rotation around the x axis, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> 2 after <b>the</b> second rotation around the y’ axis and <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> 3 as <b>the</b> third rotation around z″ axis.|$|R
50|$|Unlike SDH/SONET, {{the line}} rate is {{increased}} by maintaining <b>the</b> G.709 <b>frame</b> structure (4 rows x 4080 columns) and decreasing <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> period (in SDH/SONET <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> structure is increased and <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> period of 125 µs is maintained).|$|R
5|$|Cacti {{are used}} as {{construction}} materials. Living cactus fences are employed as barricades. The woody parts of cacti, such as Cereus repandus and Echinopsis atacamensis, are used in buildings and in furniture. <b>The</b> <b>frames</b> of wattle and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of Carnegiea gigantea. The very fine spines and hairs (trichomes) of some cacti were used {{as a source of}} fiber for filling pillows and in weaving.|$|E
5|$|However, in August 2016, LTA {{has placed}} this {{refurbishment}} programme on hold after acquisition of SMRT rail assets in August 2016 {{due to the}} concerns and issues with older trains. LTA has evaluated on the decision to replace older trains with newer ones, despite <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> of the older trains being sturdy for decades. SMRT {{would be expected to}} suffer some losses if the decisions of replacement is confirmed as the parts for refurbishment had already been purchased. In October 2016, LTA announced that it will be calling for a tender of new trains to replace all C151 trainsets.|$|E
5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> tangent <b>frame</b> bundle (or simply <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> bundle) of {{a smooth}} {{manifold}} M is <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> bundle associated to the tangent bundle of M. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> bundle of M is often denoted FM or GL(M) rather than F(TM). If M is n-dimensional then the tangent bundle has rank n, so <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> bundle of M {{is a principal}} GL(n, R) bundle over M.|$|R

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Several {{redundant}} locomotives {{were bought}} for preservation by Cliff Lawson of Tring. The group included three machines made by Ruston and Hornsby, two made by Hunslet, and two made by Lister. The eighth engine bought was the Diema, {{which was a}} hybrid made from <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> of two machines. Restoration involved splitting the components apart, and using them to rebuild both of the original locomotives, resulting in nine locomotives being preserved. Lawson re-gauged {{all of them to}} , and they have all been restored to working order. Lister 53977 was loaned to the Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|The {{measurements}} for Kronan {{were recorded in}} contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53m (174ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9m (42ft) and {{was defined as the}} widest point between <b>the</b> <b>frames,</b> excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66m (217ft).|$|E
5|$|The silver frame {{around the}} Black Stone {{and the black}} kiswah or cloth {{enveloping}} the Kaaba were for centuries maintained by the Ottoman Sultans in their role as Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. <b>The</b> <b>frames</b> wore out over time due to the constant handling by pilgrims and were periodically replaced. Worn-out frames were brought back to Istanbul, where they are still kept {{as part of the}} sacred relics in the Topkapı Palace.|$|E
5|$|The smokebox was an {{integral}} part of the air-smoothed casing, being a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox that acted as a former to maintain the shape of the casing. In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to <b>the</b> <b>frames.</b> The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.|$|E
5000|$|In {{blowback}} and gas-operated firearms, {{the slide}} reacts against <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> pushing <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> forward slightly against the recoil of the bullet leaving. In recoil operated firearms, the slide reacts against the bullet, and <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> is under no {{force at the}} time of firing. As the slide begins to recoil to the rear some of that energy is transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> through <b>the</b> locking mechanism (in locked breech designs) and the recoil spring. This transmitted energy accelerates <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> to <b>the</b> rear as well. If <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> is not sufficiently restrained by its mass and the shooter's grip or straightened wrist, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> will [...] "catch up" [...] to the slide, and the recoil spring will not be fully compressed, and the slide will return forward under less than the designed force.|$|R

5|$|The species {{used for}} the hull planks was not {{positively}} identified but {{is thought to be}} Amoora of the Meliaceae family. The timber for <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the Fabaceae family. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.|$|E
5|$|The {{work may}} have been {{intended}} for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because {{of a lack of}} surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15thcentury-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} minor {{supporting}} {{roles in the}} film, siblings Andrea, Jim, Sharon and Caroline Corr formed their own band, The Corrs, with the film's music coordinator John Hughes acting as their manager. The band has since achieved international stardom, releasing six studio albums and more than 60 million records worldwide. Andrea would again collaborate with Parker on his 1996 film adaptation of the musical Evita. Glen Hansard continued performing with his band, <b>The</b> <b>Frames,</b> and achieved greater success and critical acclaim with the 2005 film Once. Bronagh Gallagher has since enjoyed a lengthy acting career in film and television and Maria Doyle Kennedy has, to date, released eleven studio albums and {{has gone on to}} become an award-winning actress. Michael Aherne is the only cast member to have not pursued an acting career after the film's release.|$|E
50|$|All {{three cars}} had their underframes removed and {{replaced}} in 1923; <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> from Goulburn {{was used to}} build Sleeping car Acheron, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> from Campaspe for Buchan, and <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> from Wimmera for Angas.
