This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of <b>this</b> <b>star</b> is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Tucanae is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years {{away from the}} Solar System. Despite having a slightly lower mass, <b>this</b> <b>star</b> is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of <b>this</b> <b>star</b> {{are very similar to}} the Sun, with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet. It appears to have a debris disk orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2.3 astronomical units. As of 2009, no planet has been discovered in orbit around <b>this</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{search of}} <b>this</b> <b>star</b> by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of <b>this</b> <b>star</b> using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E

5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of <b>this</b> <b>star</b> relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, <b>this</b> <b>star</b> will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of <b>this</b> <b>star.</b> From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, {{the star}} {{with the highest}} known {{absolute}} magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. <b>This</b> <b>star</b> is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known {{are located in the}} NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} an extension to the MK system of spectral classiÐcation {{that allows the}} precise classiÐcation of preÈmain-sequence (PMS) A-type stars, including most Herbig Ae <b>stars.</b> <b>This</b> classiÐcation scheme characterizes the star by a standard MK type, the presence and strength of emis-sion and/or shell lines, {{and the strength of}} the Balmer decrement. It can be used to summarize temporal spectral changes in PMS A-type stars, and to search for peculiar types. We have used this scheme to classify 38 Herbig Ae stars as well as 22 PMS stars in the young open clusters NGC 2264, NGC 7160, and IC 348. We have also used this extended system to search for j Boo <b>tis</b> <b>stars</b> among PMS A-type stars. We have found one deÐnite j Boo <b>tis</b> <b>star</b> among the Ae stars, and one marginal j Boo <b>tis</b> <b>star</b> in NGC 2264, yielding statistics not signiÐcantly di†erent from those of the j Boo <b>tis</b> <b>stars</b> in the Ðeld. This, in addition to other considerations from previous studies, leads us to conclude that the j Boo tis mecha-nism is operable from very early ages (PMS) to well into the main-sequence life (a few times 108 yr) of only 2 %È 3 % of A-type stars...|$|R
5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus <b>this</b> <b>star</b> packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of <b>this</b> <b>star</b> matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, <b>this</b> <b>star</b> bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|Eta Apodis {{is a white}} main {{sequence}} star located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, <b>this</b> <b>star</b> is emitting an excess of 24μm infrared radiation, which {{may be caused by}} a debris disk of dust orbiting at a distance of more than 31 astronomical units from it.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of <b>this</b> <b>star</b> showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system.

5|$|In 2016, the IAU {{organized}} a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars.

5|$|Kepler-14b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{in orbit around}} the primary star of the binary Kepler-14 system. It is {{currently}} the only planet known to exist in <b>this</b> <b>star</b> system. Kepler-14b is 8.4 times the mass of Jupiter and has a radius 1.14 times that of Jupiter, and it orbits its host star every 6.79 days. It was discovered by NASA-led Kepler mission, which noted the planet as a planetary candidate as early as March 2009, {{around the same time}} as the discovery of the first five planets discovered by Kepler (Kepler-4b to Kepler-8b). However, the team was unable to confirm the planet until extensive follow-up observations, as high-resolution imaging resolved the star Kepler-14 as a closely orbiting binary system. The Kepler team would have not noticed that Kepler-14 was a binary star based solely on initial radial velocity measurements (a standard method for confirming a planet's existence), and found that if they had not realized this, their data on Kepler-14b would have been very inaccurate.|$|E
