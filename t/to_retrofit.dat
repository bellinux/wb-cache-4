5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work <b>to</b> <b>retrofit</b> these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|Several {{adjustments}} {{were made}} to shift the availability of passes from paper tickets to SmarTrip cards in 2012 and 2013. In May 2014 Metro announced plans <b>to</b> <b>retrofit</b> more than 500 fare vending machines throughout the system to dispense SmarTrip cards, rather than paper fare cards, and eventually eliminate magnetic fare cards entirely. This was completed in early December 2015 when the last paper farecard was sold. The faregates stopped accepting paper farecards on March 6, 2016, and the last day for trading in farecards to transfer the value to SmarTrip was June 30, 2016.|$|E

40|$|Residents {{in low-income}} housing were interviewed {{concerning}} their use, comfort {{and satisfaction with}} evaporative cooling systems. How do tenants of public housing respond <b>to</b> <b>retrofits</b> <b>to</b> improve their comfort and energy use during the cooling season? In contrast <b>to</b> <b>retrofits</b> <b>to</b> improve heating or lighting, cooling retrofits have been little studied, despite extensive programs by utilities and housing authorities to reduce this end use. A local utility and a housing authority have been retrofitting their buildings with evaporative coolers, ground-source heatpumps and other cooling measures. As {{part of an overall}} evaluation of the project we have conducted interviews with the residents, building managers and project staff to determine satisfaction with the performance of the systems. The initial evaluation revealed glaring defects in the design and installation of the systems, and not surprisingly, there was great dissatisfaction by the tenants and staff with their performance. Subsequent interventions and improvements to the equipment solved the technical problems, but tenant satisfaction was mixed. Further surveys revealed misunderstandings by the tenants {{on the nature of the}} evaporative coolers, their control and operation [...] often due to poor thermostat design [...] an...|$|R

25|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{powered by}} batteries are another alternative, and these {{have the advantage}} of having the highest well-to-wheels efficiency rate of any energy pathway and thus would allow much greater numbers of vehicles than any other methods. In addition, even if the electricity was sourced from coal-fired power plants, two advantages would remain: first it is cheaper to sequester carbon from a few thousand smokestacks than it is <b>to</b> <b>retrofit</b> hundreds of millions of vehicles, and second encouraging the use of electric vehicles allows a further pathway for scaling up of renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{concept is}} natural building, {{which is usually}} {{on a smaller scale}} and tends to focus on the use of natural {{materials}} that are available locally.

Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied <b>to</b> <b>retrofit</b> work as well as new construction.|$|E
