25|$|The Van Diemen's Land Company {{was very}} unpopular in Hobart Town. The {{settlers}} {{felt that it}} would use all the convict labour, and be favoured by government. The company started out <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> wheat and barley but found the crops often ruined by heavy rain. Arthur also gave the company no favours, and it fell into financial trouble in the 1850s. The company was, however, successful in growing potatoes, finding the island's climate and soil well suited to that and oats, peas, wheat, and grass for hay to feed livestock.|$|E

The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected to be seen, and this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> crops on the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth.|$|E

25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, a big effect will be low yields of grain {{according}} to the World Food Trade Model, specifically in the low latitude regions where much of the developing world is located. From this the price of grain will rise, along with the developing nations <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> the grain. Due to this, every 2–2.5% price hike will increase the number of hungry people by 1%. Low crop yields are just one of the problem facing farmers in the low latitudes and tropical regions. The timing and length of the growing seasons, when farmers plant their crops, are going to be changing dramatically, per the USDA, due to unknown changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions.|$|E
500|$|Tesla's {{demonstration}} of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, {{came at the}} time of extreme competition between electric companies.

[...] Lorde explained that the line [...] "We live in cities you'll never see on screen" [...] was [...] "to be speaking for the minority" [...] from small cities. She also expresses distaste in common contemporary popular music lyrics telling listeners to [...] "put your hands in the air" [...] through the verse [...] "I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air". Writer Lily Rothman for the magazine Time commented that the lyrics [...] "we sure know how to run things" [...] in [...] "Team" [...] were {{a response to the}} lyrics [...] "we run things, things don’t run we" [...] in Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013).|$|E

[...] In their review of the album, Down Beat magazine criticized the song, but subsequent reviewers have championed the song as Zappa's masterpiece. [...] Lowe called it the [...] "crowning achievement of the album" [...] and [...] "one of the most gorgeous pieces of music ever produced". [...] Zappa told Neil Slaven that {{he thought it was}} [...] "the best song on the album". The songs' title is thought to have come from a saying used by Zappa while recording the album: [...] "Playing a guitar solo with this band is like <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> watermelon in Easter hay". After Zappa died, [...] "Watermelon in Easter Hay" [...] became known as one of his signature songs, and his son, Dweezil Zappa, later referred to it as [...] "the best solo Zappa ever played".|$|E

In one continuous black and white shot, Aguilera walks through several rooms, exits the building, and finally lays on a light box. The video was filmed at a deserted theater in downtown Los Angeles.

2500|$|There is some {{speculation}} that George Washington smoked the flower of the cannabis plant {{in order to}} achieve a recreational high ("Like all farmers, Washington probably sampled the quality and potency of what he grew, and he may have used this hemp to treat his chronic tooth aches"), but there is no evidence in any of his writings that he grew hemp for anything other than industrial purposes. It is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from Washington's diary, which reads [...] "Began to [...] the Male from the Female hemp at Do. too late" [...] is evidence that he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> female plants for the THC found in the flowers. However, the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that [...] "This may arise from their [...] being coarser, and the stalks larger" [...] In subsequent days, he describes soaking the hemp (to make the fibers usable) and harvesting the seeds, suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes, not recreational.|$|E
6000|$|England was {{a revelation}} to her, and she found herself as {{diverted}} as a child at a pantomime. In her infantine excursions to Europe she had seen only the Continent, and seen it from the nursery window; Paris, not London, was her father's Mecca, and into many of his interests there his children had naturally not entered. The images of that time moreover had grown faint and remote, and the old-world quality in everything that she now saw had all the charm of strangeness. Her uncle's house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need. The large, low rooms, with brown ceilings and dusky corners, the deep embrasures and curious casements, the quiet light on dark, polished panels, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a [...] "property"--a place where sounds were felicitously accidental, where the tread was muffed by the earth itself and in the thick mild air all friction dropped out of contact and all shrillness out of talk--these things were much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions. She formed a fast friendship with her uncle, and often sat by his chair when he had had it moved out to the lawn. He passed hours in the open air, sitting with folded hands like a placid, homely household god, a god of service, who had done his work and received his wages and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> used to weeks and months made up only of off-days. Isabel amused him more than she suspected--the effect she produced upon people was often different from what she supposed--and he frequently gave himself the pleasure of making her chatter. It was by this term that he qualified her conversation, which had much of the [...] "point" [...] observable in that of the young ladies of her country, to whom the ear {{of the world is}} more directly presented than to their sisters in other lands. Like the mass of American girls Isabel had been encouraged to express herself; her remarks had been attended to; she had been expected to have emotions and opinions. Many of her opinions had doubtless but a slender value, many of her emotions passed away in the utterance; but they had left a trace in giving her the habit of seeming at least to feel and think, and in imparting moreover to her words when she was really moved that prompt vividness which so many people had regarded as a sign of superiority. Mr. Touchett used to think that she reminded him of his wife when his wife was in her teens. It was because she was fresh and natural and quick to understand, to speak--so many characteristics of her niece--that he {{had fallen in love with}} Mrs. Touchett. He never expressed this analogy to the girl herself, however; for if Mrs. Touchett had once been like Isabel, Isabel was not at all like Mrs. Touchett. The old man was full of kindness for her; it was a long time, as he said, since they had had any young life in the house; and our rustling, quickly-moving, clear-voiced heroine was as agreeable to his sense as the sound of flowing water. He wanted to do something for her and wished she would ask it of him. She would ask nothing but questions; it is true that of these she asked a quantity. Her uncle had a great fund of answers, though her pressure sometimes came in forms that puzzled him. She questioned him immensely about England, about the British constitution, the English character, the state of politics, the manners and customs of the royal family, the peculiarities of the aristocracy, the way of living and thinking of his neighbours; and in begging to be enlightened on these points she usually enquired whether they corresponded with the descriptions in the books. The old man always looked at her a little with his fine dry smile while he smoothed down the shawl spread across his legs.|$|E
