40|$|We {{present a}} {{calculus}} of mobile processes without prefix or summation, called <b>the</b> <b>solos</b> calculus. Using two different encodings, {{we show that}} <b>the</b> <b>solos</b> calculus can express both action prefix and guarded summation. One encoding gives a strong correspondence but uses a match operator; the other yields a slightly weaker correspondence but uses no additional operators. We also show that the expressive power of <b>the</b> <b>solos</b> calculus is still retained by the sub-calculus where actions carry at most two names. On the contrary, expressiveness is lost in <b>the</b> <b>solos</b> calculus without match and with actions carrying at most one name. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The {{version of}} [...] "Rock Around the Clock" [...] {{that was used}} in the movie Blackboard Jungle differs from the hit single version.

5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of <b>the</b> <b>solo</b> itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within <b>the</b> <b>solo</b> and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E

With his Vongsense, Jacen thwarts his plan, and when Nom Anor tries one more time to evade <b>the</b> <b>Solos,</b> his hand is cut off by Leia via her lightsaber. Nevertheless, Nom Anor opens up the entry into the coffers yorik-trema (landing craft) and simply allows <b>the</b> <b>Solos</b> to leave without him; due to his atheism, which makes him undesirable in the Yuuzhan Vongs society, and his contempt for the Force, which makes him undesirable in the Galactic Alliances society, Nom Anor elects to die aboard the coffer, despite his earlier vows of surviving the war.|$|R

5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two trumpets {{are added to}} the original scoring. When possible Fauré employed a mixed choir and a female soprano soloist, partly because the soprano lines, particularly <b>the</b> <b>solo</b> in the , are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control, easier for adult women than for boys.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat changes, <b>the</b> <b>Solo</b> Remix includes redrawn high-definition sprites and is optimized for the Retina display of iOS devices.

5|$|Originally {{called the}} Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female, the award was first {{presented}} to Donna Summer in 1980. Beginning with the 1995 ceremony, {{the name of}} the award was changed to Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. However, in 1988, 1992, 1994, and since 2005, this category was combined with the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and presented in a genderless category known as Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo. <b>The</b> <b>solo</b> category was later renamed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance beginning in 2005. This fusion has been criticized, especially when female performers are not nominated under <b>the</b> <b>solo</b> category. The Academy has cited a lack of eligible recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers. While the award has not been presented since the category merge in 2005, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.|$|E
