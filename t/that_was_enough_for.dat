This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

However, that was only 21, as New Zealand fell from 57 for 0 to 102 all out; {{following}} on, Hartland made 21 again as New Zealand made 361, but Sri Lanka took a nine-wicket win and the series by 1–0. Hartland also played {{two of the three}} ODIs in the series, recording his maiden ODI fifty, but New Zealand still lost both matches and the series 0–2.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{announced}} his retirement from all forms of international cricket on 17 November 2015, before play {{on the final day}} of the second Test of the Trans-Tasman Trophy series, a three-match series against New Zealand. While coming out to bat in his last innings later that day at his adopted home, the WACA Ground in Perth, Johnson received a guard of honour from the New Zealand players, who congratulated him for his prolific career. He scored 35 runs in his final innings and then took both wickets in New Zealand's second innings, with the match ending in a draw <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Australia to retain the Trans Tasman Trophy.|$|E
500|$|Glatton {{remained}} in Dover Harbour, an obstruction to shipping, with her hull visible {{at low tide}} as the Harbour Board could not afford the £45,000 quoted on average by salvage companies. Finally they asked the Harbourmaster, Captain John Iron, if {{he could do it}} for less. He estimated it would cost about £5,000 if he was granted use of the salvage craft already at Dover. The Board accepted his offer and work began in May 1925. Some [...] of silt were removed from underneath Glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away from the wreck. Four lifting lighters, with a capacity of , were hired, but they would not suffice to lift a water-logged [...] ship. It was necessary to seal all of the holes on her topside and pump air into each compartment at a rate of [...] per minute to restore her buoyancy. The first attempt to lift her began on 2 December 1925 and was successful in breaking the suction holding her to the bottom in combination with the rising tide. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the first try and the major lifting effort began the following day. Slowly she was moved, taking advantage of the tides, until on 16 March 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to the western pier of the submarine harbour, close by the shore. The total cost was considerably more than originally estimated, but still far less than that quoted by the salvage companies, at no more than £12,000. There she remains, buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal.|$|E

On 11 January 1879, British troops crossed the Tugela River; fourteen days later the disaster of Isandlwana was reported, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the House of Commons to demand that Frere be recalled. Beaconsfield supported him, however, and in a strange compromise he was censured but asked to stay on. Frere had severely underestimated the Zulus, whom he had characterized as [...] "a bunch of savages armed with sticks." ...|$|E

[...] The IMSA GT Championship had also recently ceased to exist but had since been replaced by the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) for 1999.

[...] The rest of the ALMS season was dominated by the BMW and Panoz entries, but consistent finishes for Dyson Racing allowed Elliot Forbes-Robinson to win his second Drivers Championship of 1999.|$|E
