5|$|In {{the city}} of <b>Trieste,</b> then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the Jews of <b>Trieste,</b> licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in the Stock Exchange and to other liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates of the Ghetto were opened so that the Jews of <b>Trieste</b> could live together with their fellow citizens of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, and the Jews of <b>Trieste</b> lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E
5|$|Joyce and Nora {{went into}} self-imposed exile, moving first to Zurich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught English at the Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It later came to {{fact that the}} agent had been swindled; the {{director}} of the school sent Joyce on to <b>Trieste,</b> which was then part of Austria-Hungary (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the <b>Trieste</b> Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in Pola, then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an espionage ring in the city—expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to <b>Trieste</b> and began teaching English there. He remained in <b>Trieste</b> for most of the next ten years.|$|E
5|$|Joyce became {{frustrated}} with life in <b>Trieste</b> {{and moved to}} Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank. He disliked Rome and returned to <b>Trieste</b> in early 1907. His daughter Lucia was born later that year.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{returned}} to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, {{to visit his}} father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to <b>Trieste</b> {{he decided to take}} one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in <b>Trieste</b> before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from <b>Trieste.</b> With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He {{returned to}} <b>Trieste</b> in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent {{the rest of her life}} on the continent, eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1941, <b>Trieste</b> sortied {{with the}} rest of the 2nd Squadron to search for Force H after the latter had shelled Genoa; the Italians {{returned}} to port without success. On 1213 March, <b>Trieste</b> escorted a fast convoy to North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria {{traveled}} aboard Viribus Unitis in late June 1914 {{en route}} to Bosnia to observe military maneuvers. On 25 June, he boarded the ship in <b>Trieste</b> Harbor and travelled {{to the mouth of}} the Neretva River, where he transferred to another vessel. On 30 June, two days after Ferdinand and his wife were killed by Gavrilo Princip in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, Viribus Unitis transported their bodies back to <b>Trieste.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emperor Karl {{inspected}} Budapest on 19 November at <b>Trieste.</b> Anxious to revenge {{themselves against}} the Austro-Hungarians, the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) planned {{an attack on the}} two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia, near <b>Trieste,</b> by MAS boats. On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at Wien and Budapest. The torpedoes fired at the Budapest struck the mole of the seaplane station, but Wien was hit twice and capsized in five minutes, killing 46 of the crew.|$|E
5|$|His {{house arrest}} {{did not last}} long, as in the {{following}} month, Mihailović sent Jevđević to Slovenia {{to report on the}} state of Chetnik forces there. Jevđević began developing contacts with the Germans prior to the Italian capitulation in September 1943. On 3 September, he travelled to Rome via Rijeka and made contact with German intelligence services. This marked the beginning of his collaboration with the Germans. Following the German occupation of NDH territory that had previously been held by the Italians, Jevđević moved to <b>Trieste</b> and stayed at the Hotel Continental. There, he helped organise displaced Chetniks and arranged for them to be returned to the town of Opatija. He stayed in <b>Trieste</b> until January 1944, when he relocated to Opatija with Chetniks from <b>Trieste</b> who had been placed under his command. He then moved his Chetniks to Ilirska Bistrica, and collaborated with the Germans {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 {{he entered}} the Czech Polytechnic Institute, {{studying}} under Josef Schultz and Jan Koula. He completed his studies in <b>Trieste</b> in 1910 before leaving for New York City.|$|E
5|$|Later in the day, Vittorio Veneto and Pola were torpedoed by British aircraft, {{the latter}} left immobilized. <b>Trieste,</b> Trento, and Bolzano were also {{attacked}} by aircraft, but they escaped without damage. <b>Trieste</b> reached Taranto in {{company with the}} damaged Vittorio Veneto at 15:30 the following day. in the meantime, Pola and two other Zara-class cruisers were destroyed in the night action with British battleships late on the 28th.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} Nora {{gave birth to}} their first child, George (known as Giorgio). Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, {{to join him in}} <b>Trieste,</b> and secured a {{teaching}} position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings. Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in <b>Trieste,</b> arguing about Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June 1935, <b>Trieste</b> {{temporarily}} relieved Trento as the divisional flagship. Mussolini took a short tour of Italian Libya from 10 to 12 March 1937, and <b>Trieste</b> {{was among}} the vessels to escort him. On 7 June, she {{took part in a}} major naval review held during the visit of German Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg. The ship became the 2nd Squadron flagship on 15 February 1938. On 5 May, another naval review was held in the Gulf of Naples, this time for the state visit of German dictator Adolf Hitler. On 12 October 1938, <b>Trieste</b> steamed out of Messina with the 10th Destroyer Squadron, bound for Cadiz, Spain. There, they met four Italian merchant ships on 15 October, which embarked 10,000 members of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (Corps of Volunteer Troops) that had been sent to support General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. The convoy left Cadiz on 16 October and arrived back in Naples on the 20th. On 17 May 1939, <b>Trieste</b> took part in another fleet review, this one for Prince Paul of Yugoslavia during his visit to Italy. From 5 to 19 June, <b>Trieste</b> joined the rest of the fleet in Livorno for the first celebration of Navy Day on 10 June. From October to December, the ship underwent a major refit, which included modifications to her armament and the installation of funnel caps.|$|E
5|$|One of his {{students}} in <b>Trieste</b> was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the Jewish faith in Ulysses came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce. While living in <b>Trieste,</b> Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.|$|E
5|$|The keels for Vittorio Veneto and Littorio {{were laid}} on the same day, 28 October 1934, at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico {{shipyard}} in <b>Trieste</b> and the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa, respectively. Vittorio Veneto was launched on 22 July 1937, with Littorio following exactly one month later on 22 August. While incomplete, Vittorio Veneto went to sea on 23 October 1939 to conduct machinery trials. She was delivered to the Italian Navy in <b>Trieste,</b> still incomplete, some six months later on 28 April 1940. She departed <b>Trieste</b> on 1 May for final fitting out at the dockyard in La Spezia. After completion on 15 May 1940, she went to Taranto to join the fleet. Littorio underwent {{the same pattern of}} machinery trials prior to completion; she was delivered to the fleet on 6 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trieste</b> {{returned}} to action in August 1942 for {{an operation that}} was cancelled following the torpedoing of another Italian cruiser by a British submarine. <b>Trieste</b> was moved to La Maddalena, Sardinia, where she was later sunk by United States heavy bombers on 10 April 1943. Salvage work on <b>Trieste</b> began in 1950. Her superstructure was cut away and she was refloated and towed to La Spezia; an inspection revealed that fuel oil had leaked into the machinery spaces, protecting them while the ship had been submerged. The Spanish Navy purchased the hull in 1952 and had her towed to Ferrol, with plans to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The project ultimately came to nothing due to the growing costs of the project, forcing its cancellation in 1956. She was ultimately broken up by 1959.|$|E
5|$|Between 1939 and 1941, German forces invaded Poland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Soviet Union. <b>Trieste,</b> South Tyrol and Istria were ceded to Germany by Mussolini in 1943. Two puppet {{districts were}} {{set up in the}} area, the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral and the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Wien {{was struck}} by Italian torpedoes and sank in her home port of <b>Trieste.</b> The {{remaining}} two ships were ceded to Great Britain {{following the end of}} the war and were scrapped between 1920 and 1922.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945 the {{battalion}} {{returned to the}} front line {{to take part in}} the final stages of the war. On 1 April {{the battalion}} entered the line near Granarolo along with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade and for the next month they were involved in five main battles along the Senio, Santerno, Sillaro, Gaiana and Idice rivers as the Allies pursued the Germans back towards <b>Trieste.</b> It was in <b>Trieste</b> that the Māori Battalion's war came to an end. Their involvement in the final stages of the fighting in Italy had cost them 25 killed and 117 wounded, while losses for the entire Italian campaign were 230 men killed, and 887 wounded.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, {{the port}} {{authorities}} of <b>Trieste,</b> Ravenna, Venice and Koper established the North Adriatic Ports Association (NAPA) in <b>Trieste</b> {{with the aim}} of enhancing the position of the ports in the European Union and its transport patterns. The Port of Rijeka joined the NAPA in November 2010. The NAPA aims to harmonize information systems and organizational setup of the member ports in order to attract shipping. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2013. Besides the NAPA, the Port of Rijeka {{is also a member of}} the EcoPorts network of the European Sea Ports Organisation, the International Harbour Masters' Association, Association Internationale Villes et Ports, the Croatian Association of Port Authorities and the International Association of Ports and Harbors.|$|E
5|$|In the interwar period, the two cruisers {{served in}} the Cruiser Division, {{frequently}} alternating as the divisional flagship. Trento made two extensive trips abroad, {{the first was a}} tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, <b>Trieste</b> assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. <b>Trieste</b> was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of Sirte, where at the latter action Trento damaged a British destroyer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Austria-Hungary {{established}} a geodetic network, {{for which the}} elevation benchmark {{was determined by the}} Adriatic Sea's average level at the Sartorio pier in <b>Trieste.</b> This benchmark was subsequently retained by Austria, adopted by Yugoslavia, and kept by the states that emerged after its dissolution, including Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo {{was born}} in Melbourne to a Mauritian father and an Italian mother who was from <b>Trieste.</b> Because of his mother's birth, Kisnorbo holds an Italian passport, which allows him to bypass European Union work permit restrictions.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March, the {{division}} sortied {{with the rest}} of the fleet for a major sweep toward the island of Crete. During the operation, <b>Trieste</b> flew the flag of Rear Admiral Luigi Sansonetti. At 06:55 on the 28th, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by Vittorio Veneto located a British cruiser squadron, and by 07:55, Trento and the 3rd Division had come within visual range. Seventeen minutes later, the Italian cruisers opened fire from a range of , initiating the first phase of the Battle of Cape Matapan; in the span of the next forty minutes, <b>Trieste</b> fired a total of 132armor-piercing shells, though trouble with her rangefinders and the extreme range of the action prevented her from scoring any significant hits.|$|E
5|$|Pursuant to the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy {{the islands}} of Cres, Lastovo and Palagruža and the cities of Zadar and Rijeka and most of Istria went to {{communist}} Yugoslavia and Croatia, while carving out the Free Territory of <b>Trieste</b> (FTT) as a city-state. The FTT was partitioned in 1954 as <b>Trieste</b> itself and the area {{to the north of}} it were placed under Italian control, and the rest under Yugoslav control. The arrangement was made permanent by the Treaty of Osimo in 1975. The former FTT's Yugoslav part was partitioned between Croatia and Slovenia, largely conforming to the area population's ethnic composition.|$|E
5|$|Relieved by a Polish unit in March 1945, the {{regiment}} {{returned to the}} front lines in early April after a period of rest. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard and on 2 May, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered <b>Trieste.</b> While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. The partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders, and {{the regiment}} remained in <b>Trieste</b> for several weeks until the large numbers of Yugoslav partisans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Trento and <b>Trieste</b> {{were named}} for the two largest unredeemed cities taken from Austria-Hungary in the {{aftermath}} of World War I. They frequently served as the flagship of the Cruiser Division throughout the 1930s. During the pre-war period, Trento made lengthy trips abroad, including a tour of South America from May to October 1929 and a deployment to China from January to June 1932 to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. Both vessels took part in numerous naval reviews held for visiting foreign leaders in the 1930s, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. In 1938 <b>Trieste</b> helped transport soldiers of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (Corps of Volunteer Troops) that had been sent to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War return to Italy in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Trento was torpedoed and sunk by a British torpedo bomber and a {{submarine}} in June 1942 with heavy loss of life. In April 1943, <b>Trieste</b> was also sunk in port at La Maddalena during {{an attack by}} United States heavy bombers. Salvage operations began in 1950, and after {{it was determined that}} the ship's engines had been preserved by leaked fuel oil, the hull was sold to the Spanish Navy, which planned to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The plan was eventually cancelled in 1956 due to rising costs of the project, and <b>Trieste</b> was broken up for scrap in 1959.|$|E
5|$|After the {{fighting}} in North Africa ceased in 1943, the 25th Battalion participated in the Italian Campaign, fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino. It finished the war in <b>Trieste,</b> and remained there to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans that had entered the city. After {{the withdrawal of the}} partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved to Florence while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.|$|E
5|$|Babenberg was {{the last}} of three battleships of her class. Her keel was laid down on 19 January 1901 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in <b>Trieste.</b> Following {{about a year and a}} half of construction, she was launched on 4 October 1902. After final fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet on 15 April 1904.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1915, both boats {{conducted}} reconnaissance cruises out {{of either}} <b>Trieste</b> or Pola until declared obsolete in early 1918. Both remained in {{service as a}} training boats at the submarine base on Brioni, but each was at Pola {{at the end of}} the war. They were ceded to Italy as war reparations in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. Neither submarine sank any ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1861, a {{sequence}} of events led to the independence and unification of Italy (except for Venetia, Rome, Trento and <b>Trieste,</b> known as Italia irredenta, which were united {{with the rest of}} Italy in 1866, 1870, and 1918 respectively); this period of Italian history is known as the Risorgimento, or resurgence. During this period, the tricolore became the symbol which united all the efforts of the Italian people towards freedom and independence.|$|E
5|$|By 1949, the CIA {{claimed that}} Jevđević's {{intelligence}} material {{was being used}} by the Italian Ministry of Interior, the United States Counterintelligence Corps, British Forensic Science Service in <b>Trieste,</b> and French intelligence services in Rome and Paris. His intelligence correspondents included Đujić, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, Konstantin Fotić, the former Yugoslav ambassador to the United States, and Miro Didek, Croat politician Vladko Maček's self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via <b>Trieste</b> and from émigré groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jevđević claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. In 1951, Jevđević began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, Canada, Australia and various European countries.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{and tourism}} are {{significant}} {{sources of income}} all along the Adriatic coast. Adriatic Croatia's tourism industry has grown faster economically {{than the rest of}} the Adriatic Basin's. Maritime transport is also a significant branch of the area's economy—there are 19 seaports in the Adriatic that each handle more than a million tonnes of cargo per year. The largest Adriatic seaport by annual cargo turnover is the Port of <b>Trieste,</b> while the Port of Split is the largest Adriatic seaport by passengers served per year.|$|E
5|$|From 1915, both boats {{conducted}} reconnaissance cruises out {{of either}} <b>Trieste</b> or Pola. In January 1918, the boats were declared obsolete, but remained in service as training boats at the submarine base at Brioni, {{but at the}} war's end both boats were in Pola, After the war, both boats were ceded to Italy as war reparations and scrapped. Neither boat sank any ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|From January to June 1915, U-2 {{underwent}} a refit {{and received a}} new conning tower. She was stationed at <b>Trieste</b> in mid July and conducted reconnaissance cruises from that port. On 11 January 1918, she was declared obsolete, but was retained as a training boat at the submarine base on Brioni. U-2 was at Pola at the war's end, and was scrapped after her cession to Italy as a war reparation in 1920. U-2 did not sink any ships during the war.|$|E
