40|$|Using simultaneous-equation models, {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{whether there is}} interdependence between smallholder’s net market positions in crop and live animals markets under mixed crop–livestock system. Household level data collected in 2009 from 1075 sample households in 10 districts of Ethiopia are used for the analyses. Results confirm the existence of interdependence between household’s net positions in crop and live animals markets and, relatively, the net position of households in the live animals market is dictated by their net position in the crop market. The interdependence between the two market positions shows that households stock live animal asset through selling surplus crops produced and finance crop purchase through live animals sales. The relative strength of the net market position in crop markets shows that prior to their involvement in live animal market, farm households analyse their position in crop production, consumption, marketable surplus, and the household’s ability <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> through crop sale. Thus, policies/strategies enhancing smallholders’ participation in crop and live animals markets in mixed crop–livestock system should {{pay attention to the}} production and marketing of both commodities simultaneously.

The elements of cash management are identified as establishing bank relations, preparing cash flow statements, estimating collection receipts and analyzing cash flow and preparing a budget. Amongst the objectives of cash management is to ensure availability of cash resources at all times for efficient and unconstrained implementation of the annual budget. The primary goals of a good cash management system are to maintain adequate <b>cash</b> at hand <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the daily <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> of the local government while maximizing the amount available for investment and to obtain the maximum earnings on invested funds while ensuring their safety. The local governments obtain their revenue through internal and external sources, the external sources of revenue includes federal statutory allocations and loans obtained from financial institutions and other agencies; while among the internal sources are revenue from market fees, fees collected from motor parks, street hawking fees, shop fees and other miscellaneous sources. Some of the cost effective methods of revenue collections are contracting out of revenue collections to private collection agency, designating collection points for convenience, application of e-collection method where the local governments device a means of allowing tax payers to pay their taxes online.

40|$|Kachia Grazing Reserve (KGR) in {{northern}} Nigeria {{was home to}} some 10, 000 Fulani pastoralists and their 40, 000 cattle in June 2011. This study examines productivity and management of cattle belonging to livestock keepers within the reserve before and after a mass immigration event when 3, 000 refugees moved into the reserve with their cattle to escape inter-community violence during May 2011. Data, on livestock management strategies (transhumance) and production parameters (herd size, composition, fertility, dynamics), were collected in March, June and October 2011. Cattle productivity in KGR is geared to supporting Fulani households while maintaining herd wealth. High offtake of young animals, especially the selling of heifers, was an unusual finding and may indicate that KGR pastoralists have been restricting their herd size voluntarily as well as limiting milk production to household requirements. This is {{probably due to the}} absence of a commercial milk market and a higher reliance on the sale of young stock <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>cash</b> needs. Despite the widespread perception that grazing reserves are promoting sedentarisation of Fulani pastoralists and curbing transhumance, the inhabitants of the KGR were observed to practise wide-ranging transhumance both during wet and dry seasons driven by the limited availability of grazing. Some households selected a sub-sample of animals for transhumance rather than sending their whole herd, and some maintained cattle on alternative land-holdings outside the reserve. KGR households described modifying their usual transhumance practices in response to the mass immigration event and insecurity. Nevertheless, the herd demography results from this study are broadly similar to data obtained from other studies over the past 40 years, indicating that productivity and management practices have remained relatively unchanged...|$|R

These results are derived in a tractable framework by describing risky alternatives in terms of expected values and variances. Key words: bankruptcy, credit reserves, expected value-variance model, fixed assets, leverage ratios, liquidation costs, risk aversion. A basic principle of finance for the single inves-tor in a proprietary firm is that increases in financial leverage will increase the expected level and variability of returns to the investor's equity capital (e. g., Francis and Archer; Van Home). Optimal leverage then depends on the investor's attitude toward risk as reflected by the properties of his utility function and the level and variability of returns. Moreover, op-timal leverage will change as changes occur in expected returns, interest costs, variances, and risk attitudes (Robison and Barry 1977; Adler; Levy). If, for example, a permanent increase in the variance of returns occurs, then one plausible response is to reduce leverage. How-ever, a different response may occur in the short run if the greater risk, combined with high cash flow obligations, jeopardizes the Lindon J.

To combat these challenges, {{the country and}} development organizations have turned to agriculture. In particular, value chains {{have been identified as}} a point of interest. Specifically, the maize value chain is of critical importance since maize is the staple crop of the country as well as the staple carbohydrate in the Tanzanian diet. Markets are beneficial because they enable households to specialize in agricultural production according to their comparative advantage. Specifically, markets {{have been shown to be}} one tool for increasing welfare, measured through the proxy income. The objective of this thesis is to identify the determinants of a household’s decision to participate in the maize market as well as identify the determinants of a household’s decision regarding how much maize to sell in a given market. This research examines formal and informal market participation among 908 households during the 2008 long rainy season. Probit models were estimated to determine market participation for the formal, informal, and aggregate sale market levels. A Heckman OLS model was used to further analyze the value sold by the household in a given market. Econometric results indicate that “quantity harvested” positively and significantly impacts market participation decisions as well as value sold decisions. The variable “male-headed households” was positive and significant in the formal market while the variable showed no significant impact in the informal market participation model. Both “radio ownership” and “mobile telephone ownership” proved to be positive and significant in the formal model while only the ownership of a radio was significant in the informal market. Additionally it was found that for the formal market participation decision, “bicycle ownership” was positive and significant. Overall, it appears that households participate in the informal market as a way <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>cash</b> needs since farmers were not price-responsive.

If the goal of the ranch operator is <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> both <b>cash</b> costs and depreciation, a cattle ranch supporting 105 breeding cows is the minimum size necessary. If provision is made to cover cash costs and depreciation in addition to receiving a fair return for operator and family labor, the ranch must support at least 360 breeding cows. None of the four ranch sizes studied were capable of meeting all production costs including five per cent interest on investment. The minimum ranch size necessary to cover all production costs including 1. 4 per cent interest on investment is 500 head of breeding cows. Farmer questionnaires and the machine capacity technique provided data from which five long-run average cost curves were derived by connecting points representing average production costs and levels of wheat output for four sizes of wheat farms (500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 acres). The long-run average cost curves were analyzed in combination with the 1968 Utah wheat price. All four wheat farm sizes studied are capable of meeting cash costs. In order to cover both cash costs and depreciation a wheat farm of at least 940 acres is required. The minimum wheat farm size necessary <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>cash</b> costs and depreciation as well as provide a fair return to operator and family labor is 2430 acres.

Wheat production on a tenant basis is the only short-run alternative open to cropland owners who own neither wheat production factors nor the improvements necessary for grazing enterprises. Leasing forage on a livestock gain basis is the most favorable short-run alternative for cropland owners whose holdings are equipped with grazing improvements. For the long-run situation in which all inputs were considered variable, all five management alternatives yielded negative returns. Under such conditions a rational land owner would refuse to choose from among the five alternatives studied and would instead liquidate his land holdings. When operator and family labor and land were considered fixed, leasing cropland to tenants for dryland wheat production proved to be the most favorable long-run management alternative.
