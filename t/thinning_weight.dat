40|$|ABSTRACT Density Management Diagrams (DMD) {{contribute}} to the forester, as they allow {{the understanding of the}} current situation of the stand, in addition to helping predict its future conditions. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop Density Management Diagrams for Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden, which will serve as auxiliary models for this species, and to establish appropriate density variation, or management zone, for managing stands to be demarcated on the diagram. Full density stands will be used for the study area. The construction of the diagram will be based on the maximum density line (A-line) obtained from fully stocked stands. From this line, stand density indices (B-line and C-line) will be generated in a gradual and proportional manner. The management zone will be made according to the required <b>thinning</b> <b>weight,</b> and afterwards it will generate Density Management Diagram (DMD). This study allowed us to find a possible adjustment of stand density of Eucalyptus grandis Hill, which is fundamental for management of the stand...|$|E

40|$|J. -P. Michel Abstract. Frailty {{has long}} been {{considered}} synonymous with disability and co-morbidity, to be highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, hospitalization, and mortality. However it is becoming recognized that frailty may be a distinct clinical syndrome with a biologic basis. The frailty process appears as a transitional state in the dynamic progression from robustness through to functional decline. During this process, total physiological reserves decrease, and become {{less likely to be}} sufficient to maintain and repair the ageing body. The lack of consensus on the definition of frailty is partially related to the widespread use of the expression for different aspects of the condition. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that slow gait, fatigue, exhaustion, anorexia, unintentional weight loss and reduced muscle strength should all be considered as major symptoms of frailty. At the stage of frailty, clinicians can easily distinguish frail from non-frail older adults using factors such as appearance (consistent or not with age), nutritional status (<b>thin,</b> <b>weight</b> loss), subjective health rating (health perception), performance (cogni-tion, fatigue), sensory/physical impairments (vision, hearing, strength), and current car...|$|R

[...] "With that underdeveloped, boyish figure, she is an idol to the 14- and 15-year-old kids. She makes virtue of all the terrible things of gawky, miserable adolescence." [...] At the height of her fame, Mark Cohen, president of Leeds Women's shop, had an even harsher view: [...] "Her legs remind me of two painted worms." [...] Yet Twiggy had her supporters. Diana Vreeland of Vogue stated, [...] "She's no flash in the pan. She is the mini-girl in the mini-era. She's delicious looking." [...] In recent years, Twiggy has spoken out against the trend of waif-thin models, explaining that her own <b>thin</b> <b>weight</b> as a teenager was natural: [...] "I was very skinny, but that was just my natural build.

50|$|A new {{generation}} of telescopes built since the 1980s use <b>thin,</b> lighter <b>weight</b> mirrors instead.

The telescope may also be segmented into multiple smaller mirrors, which reduce the sagging due to weight that occurs for large, monolithic mirrors.|$|R

40|$|Frailty {{has long}} been {{considered}} synonymous with disability and comorbidity, to be highly prevalent in old age and to confer a high risk for falls, hospitalization and mortality. However, it is becoming recognized that frailty may be a distinct clinical syndrome with a biological basis. The frailty process {{appears to be a}} transitional state in the dynamic progression from robustness to functional decline. During this process, total physiological reserves decrease and become less likely to be sufficient for the maintenance and repair of the ageing body. Central to the clinical concept of frailty is that no single altered system alone defines it, but that multiple systems are involved. Clinical consensus regarding the phenotype which constitutes frailty, drawing upon the opinions of numerous authors, shows the characteristics to include wasting (loss of both muscle mass and strength and weight loss), loss of endurance, decreased balance and mobility, slowed performance, relative inactivity and, potentially, decreased cognitive function. Frailty is a distinct entity easily recognized by clinicians, with multiple manifestations and with no single symptom being sufficient or essential in its presentation. Manifestations include appearance (consistent or not with age), nutritional status (<b>thin,</b> <b>weight</b> loss), subjective health rating (health perception), performance (cognition, fatigue), sensory/physical impairments (vision, hearing, strength) and current care (medication, hospital). Although {{the early stages of the}} frailty process may be clinically silent, when depleted reserves reach an aggregate threshold leading to serious vulnerability, the syndrome may become detectable by looking at clinical, functional, behavioral and biological markers. Thus, a better understanding of these clinical changes and their underlying mechanisms, beginning in the pre-frail state, may confirm the impression held by many geriatricians that increasing frailty is distinguishable from ageing and in consequence is potentially reversible. We therefore provide an update of the physiopathology and clinical and biological characteristics of the frailty process and speculate on possible preventative approaches...|$|R
