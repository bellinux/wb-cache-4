5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough {{to give him a}} second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that {{everyone}} around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Edward Gibbon had {{observed}} that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> {{the numbers and}} names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who {{was meant to be}} writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve {{at least some of the}} six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favor of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the Augustan History and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae) proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).|$|E
25|$|It is {{precisely}} because he fathered a healthy son with Elizabeth that Henry was convinced his wife's inability to bear him a son was Catherine's fault. She gave birth to at least three boys, yet only the first lived as long as seven weeks. These facts led Henry to believe <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> his marriage to Catherine, and {{that he needed to}} annul his marriage.|$|E
50|$|From a neurobiological perspective, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{three reasons}} {{that could cause}} a person to have hearing loss: either <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the {{mechanical}} portion of the process, meaning the conductive portions of the ear (external and middle ear), or <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the sensory portion of the process (inner ear or cochlea and related structures) or <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the neural portion of the process, meaning the nerves or brain.|$|R

2500|$|Screenwriter Dale Launer, who was {{a friend}} of the Rodger family, stated that he had counseled Rodger on {{approaching}} and befriending women, but that Rodger did not follow the advice. He said in an interview, [...] "I first met [...] when he was aged eight or nine and I could see then that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> him.
