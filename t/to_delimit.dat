5|$|Python is {{intended}} to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Python does not use curly brackets <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional, in contrast to many other programming languages. Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E
5|$|Python uses {{whitespace}} indentation <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> blocks – {{rather than}} curly braces or keywords. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; {{a decrease in}} indentation signifies {{the end of the}} current block. This feature is also sometimes termed the off-side rule.|$|E
5|$|In both {{navigation}} modes, Air-Cobot is {{also able}} to detect, track, identify and avoid obstacles that are in its way. The laser data from laser range sensors and visual data from the cameras {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification of the obstacles. The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser data can be used <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> work areas in the image.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>delimiting</b> blocks, {{popularized by}} C, is to ignore whitespace and mark blocks explicitly with curly brackets (i.e. [...] and [...] ) {{or some other}} delimiter. While this allows for more freedom - the developer might choose not to indent small pieces of code like the break and continue statements - sloppily indented code might lead the reader astray.|$|R
5|$|On 23 May 2008, the Court {{ruled that}} Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty, while Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia. As regards South Ledge, the Court {{noted that it}} falls within the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, {{it belongs to the}} state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.|$|E
5|$|South Ledge {{falls within}} the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> {{the extent of the}} territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.|$|E

The abstract machine is derived from an evaluator in continuation-passing style (CPS); the reduction semantics (i. e., a small-step operational semantics with an explicit representation of evaluation contexts) is constructed from the abstract machine; and the control operators are the shift and reset family. We also present new applications of delimited continuations in the CPS hierarchy: finding list prefixes and normalization by evaluation for a hierarchical language of units and products.

5|$|On 21 December 1979, Malaysia {{published}} a map {{that showed the}} island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together {{with the issue of}} sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E

30|$|The {{neoliberal}} administrations tend to favour {{large farm}} operations (e.g. a feedlot) and mining. This {{is leading to}} resource exploitation of vast land areas by powerful companies. The potential of new conflicts due <b>to</b> <b>delimiting</b> access and creating competition for resources {{is just around the}} corner, as occurs elsewhere (Hollander [2013]). An example in Mexico is the experience with mines: local communities do not get what they are promised, while mines restrict access to communal grazing land and also pollute air, soil and water (Rodríguez Wallenius [2011]). Similarly, the feedlot enterprise in the vicinity of one of the villages is polluting air and water sources.|$|R
5000|$|Overfarming and {{attendant}} water {{problems caused}} {{the government to}} establish the Ministry of Water Resources in 1990 with the mandate of limiting water consumption and improving irrigation. A freeze on new wells was imposed in addition <b>to</b> <b>delimiting</b> several [...] "no drill zones" [...] in areas where groundwater supplies are low. The ministry is also considering the installation of water meters. Recharge dams are designed to hold rainwater in the wadis {{for a period of}} time to facilitate the trickling of water down into the ground; replenishing aquifers have been built mainly in the northeastern Al Batinah region, where the groundwater levels are up to five meters below sea level.|$|R

25|$|Some {{programming}} languages, like Pascal, use the ASCII apostrophe <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> string literal. In JavaScript (and ECMAScript, {{which is}} nearly identical), Perl, PHP, and Python, {{and many other}} languages either the apostrophe or the double quote may be used, allowing string literals to contain the other character (but not to contain both without using an escape character).|$|E
25|$|Subspecies {{distinction}} is uncertain at best. The color variation between populations is less pronounced than between birds {{of the same}} population. Migratory populations are longer-winged than those resident year-round, but this cannot be used <b>to</b> <b>delimit</b> subspecies as it is quite obviously {{is a consequence of}} differing habits and can be expected to undergo convergent evolution in unrelated populations of this species that just share the same habits. Thus, thorough molecular phylogenetic studies would be required to resolve the question of subspecies delimitation.|$|E

Following a meeting on 3 June 2008, the Committee agreed that a technical sub-committee would be established to oversee the conduct of joint survey works to prepare the way for talks on maritime issues in and around the area. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters. In September 2008, the Joint Technical Committee reported that its Sub-Committee on Joint Survey Works was finalising technical preparations for a hydrographic survey that would provide data for future delimitation discussions. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed, and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond [...] off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge.|$|E

40|$|The Roman Jakobson’s {{criticism}} of the Saussurean langue/parole distinction, in his La théorie saussurienne en retrospection, {{is based on the}} acceptance of a given object in Bachelard’s sense: the language (langage) as a complex unity which we only have to analyze. It contains no theorization of langue as a norm. On the contrary, the Saussurean langue/parole distinction {{is at the same time}} epistemological and theoretical: It amounts <b>to</b> <b>delimiting</b> an object in the whole language (langage) and to theorizing the dimension of communication which is inherent to human language. Thus, the Saussurean distinction appears to be at the foundation of the theorization of langue, which founds linguistics, but whose necessity is dissimulated, in a linguistic theory like Jakobson’s, by the language(langage) as a given object and the langue/parole problematics following from it...|$|R
40|$|The Pacific island States possess limited land {{territory}} but enormous maritime entitlements. Claims to maritime jurisdiction out to 200 nautical miles offshore, {{and in some}} cases the existence of continental shelf rights extending beyond the 200 mile limit, have resulted in overlapping claims and the creation of numerous “new” international maritime boundaries. The majority of these potential maritime boundaries both among the Pacific island States and between the Pacific island States and their maritime neighbours have yet <b>to</b> be <b>delimited.</b> The paper outlines relevant claims to maritime jurisdiction including recent submissions regarding outer continental shelf limits, explores how maritime boundaries are <b>to</b> be <b>delimited</b> and examines progress towards the delimitation of potential maritime boundaries in the Pacific islands region before concluding with some preliminary thoughts on the key challenges involved in this context...|$|R
