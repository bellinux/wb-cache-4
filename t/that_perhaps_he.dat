25|$|In the Life of Crassus Plutarch {{wrote that}} in Rome {{there were reports}} about the two men's meeting with Caesar. Pompey and Crassus {{were asked if they}} were going to be {{candidates}} for the consulship. Pompey replied <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was, and perhaps he was not. Crassus replied that he would if it was in the interest of the city, but otherwise he would desist. When they announced their candidacies everyone withdrew theirs, but Cato encouraged Lucius Domitius to proceed with his. He withdrew it when his slave was killed. Plutarch mentioned Cato's encouragement and the murder of the slave in The Life of Pompey as well.|$|E
25|$|At Stellenbosch Du Plessis was {{initially}} {{more interested in}} cricket than rugby; he had chosen to go there because of his desire {{to play in the}} university cricket team. In 1971 his prowess at cricket earned him selection to the South African Universities cricket side, and then to the Western Province team during that same year. Playing five first-class cricket matches as a right-arm medium pace bowler, he took 16 wickets at an average of 25.62 runs per wicket, and turned in a best performance of 4 wickets for 71 runs. But when Barry Richards, opening batsman of the South African and of the Natal cricket sides, hit Du Plessis for two sixes in the final over before lunch during a Castle Cup match between Western Province and Natal, he decided <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> should rather concentrate on rugby.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Castro had decided to retaliate for the attempts on his life, and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was behind the assassination of JFK. According to the Church Committee: Book V, Drew Pearson, {{a writer for the}} Washington Post, met with Chief Justice Earl Warren in January 1967. The columnist passed along information to Warren that a client of one of his Washington lawyer friends had told his friend that Castro had plans to retaliate. Pearson asked Warren to meet with the lawyer, but Warren never did. However, Warren did inform the director of the Secret Service, James Rowley. Rowley passed the information on to Hoover, who in turn sent six secret letters to senior Bureau officials. There are no records of these conversations, and officials have adamantly denied that conversations about Castro's revenge plans ever took place. The FBI's final word on the matter was that they had not found evidence suggesting that Lee Harvey Oswald had links to the Cuban government. They never informed the new administration of these talks.|$|E

Or {{it may not have}} been strychnine at all, but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1967, he was {{divorced}} {{from his first}} wife of 30 years, Ratna [...] "Elie". In 1968, he began {{to turn away from}} photography and return to his passion for drawing and painting. He admitted <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> had said all he could through photography. He married Magnum photographer Martine Franck, thirty years younger than himself, in 1970. The couple had a daughter, MÃ©lanie, in May 1972.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Hand {{concedes that}} this was perhaps a mistake and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> should have re-negotiated the offer. In the foreword, Sather {{expressed}} his disappointment that [...] "he didn't accept my deal because he could have advanced in North America. His progress would have been celebrated." [...] Indeed, Sather also says [...] "At the training camp I {{could see that he}} had a great ability to read the ice and he was the smartest player there other than Wayne Gretzky. He skated well: his intelligence on the ice stood out. He was a real prospect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{six months}} later at The Forum in Inglewood, California, on September 10, 1973, Ali avenged the Norton loss but only after he got the return by a split decision. Norton weighed in at 205lbs (5 pounds lighter than his first match with Ali) and boxing scribes {{discussed}} that his preparation was too intense and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> had overtrained. There were some furious exchanges in this hard-fought battle. From Ali's point of view, a loss here would have seriously dented his claim of ever being [...] "The Greatest." [...] During the ABC broadcast of the fight, broadcaster (and Ali confidant and friend) Howard Cosell repeatedly told viewers a dancing and jabbing Ali was dominating the action despite Norton's constant offense and Ali's inability to penetrate Norton's awkward defensive style. [...] The close and controversial scoring was {{in stark contrast to}} Cosell's fight-long insistence that Ali had matters well in hand.|$|E

2500|$|After {{arriving}} in Basutoland, Gordon met with Prince Masupha {{to persuade him}} to lay down his arms and to accept his father's protectorate plan rather than have his kingdom annexed to the Orange Free State. Faught wrote that Gordon was only in South Africa for a short time, but one of his enduring legacies is the existence of Lesotho, which otherwise would have been annexed to the Orange Free State and whose people would have thus suffered from apartheid in the 20th century. After his return from South Africa, Galbraith remarked that Gordon had a [...] "strange combination of melancholia, resignation and mysticism" [...] that he was destined by God both to do something great and to die soon. During this time, Leopold who was most anxious to fire Stanley with his ever-increasing demands for more money, constantly wrote to Gordon asking him to be his agent in the Congo. Gordon had come to distrust Leopold, but he came to believe <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> could do some good in the Congo.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land" [...] and its b-side [...] "Fun Stuff" [...] {{were made}} {{available}} for streaming on the FactCat website. A video for [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land", which featured flickering flashlights, was made available on 16 October, and the single was {{made available for}} digital download on 16 November and on seven-inch vinyl on 7 December. Alongside {{the announcement of the}} album's title on Scottish music blog, The Pop Cop, the band unveiled a fifth member, Gordon Skene, formerly of Make Model. Later, NME confirmed the band would be playing a special intimate show in London to celebrate Skene's arrival. Similar to Andy Monaghan's entry into the band in early 2008, Skene was not involved in recording the album. Upon his arrival, Hutchison noted that [...] "it must be difficult for him coming into something that four other people were involved in studio-wise. He's not seen any of that process yet. He's coming in playing these songs <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> likes, but doesn't have that same level of connection with, so I think one of the aims [...] is to try and help build that for him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh dear me!' replied Traddles, 'it {{would be}} very {{difficult}} to answer <b>that</b> question. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> voted for somebody, or lent money to somebody, or bought something of somebody, or otherwise obliged somebody, or jobbed for somebody, who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the county to nominate him for the commission.' ...|$|R
60|$|Barry now comforted {{himself with}} the {{reflection}} {{that there was no}} great harm done, and that though, certainly, there had been some row between him and Anty, it would probably blow over; and then, also, he began to reflect <b>that,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> what <b>he</b> had said and done, would frighten her out of her match with Kelly.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin looked up, and {{his lips}} seemed to move, but he said nothing. Mr. Brott felt <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was on {{difficult}} ground.|$|R

60|$|But <b>that</b> evening <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> {{forgot it}} altogether: {{he had been}} {{drinking}} rather heavily of late.

[...] "He said <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> if <b>he</b> {{had heard her}} real name from the first it might have restrained him. As it was, he made the discovery too late. Asked me to tell Zoe this together {{with a lot more}} nonsense." ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Miles {{received}} this account of our proposed companion with rather a wry face, and after murmuring <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> {{was a little}} mad, inquired if he were rich.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Brownlow's indignation {{was greatly}} roused; but {{reflecting}} <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted {{to be sworn}} at once.|$|R
