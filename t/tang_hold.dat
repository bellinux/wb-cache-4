5000|$|Smaller Opinel models (Nos. 2 through 5) have no locking blade mechanism, and {{use only}} the {{friction}} of the clamping band against the compressed handle and knife <b>tang</b> to <b>hold</b> the blade open, {{much the same}} as all Opinel knives sold before 1955. This simple design was sometimes known as a [...] "penny knife" [...] or [...] "peasant's knife".|$|R

50|$|Emperor Taizong of <b>Tang</b> once got <b>hold</b> of a Tartar {{priest who}} could “charm people into unconsciousness, and then charm {{them back to}} life again,” and spoke of his powers to Fu Yi. The latter said confidently, “He {{will not be able}} to charm me;” and when put to the test, the priest {{completely}} failed. He was the originator of epitaphs, and wrote his own, as follows: --Fu Yi loved the green hills and the white clouds. Alas! He died of drink.|$|R
5000|$|Freedom Yachts was {{the maker}} of the Freedom (sail) and Legacy (power) yacht brands. The Freedom sailboats have {{unstayed}} rigs, meaning that the mast is freestanding and {{not supported by the}} normal set of wires called standing rigging. Garry Hoyt, a champion sailor and noted maverick, created the unstayed rigs to give [...] "freedom" [...] from the inefficient sail shapes of traditional sloop rigs as well as to give [...] "freedom" [...] from the compression and maintenance issues associated with standing rigging. A known issue with this style of mast, however, is that in rough seas it can break loose, causing a potential holing (pounds through the bottom of the hull). This is commonly due to the <b>tangs</b> that <b>hold</b> it in place failing. The masts are made of carbon fiber and are set well forward on the boat. This means most of the sail area is contained in the mainsail. Jib sails can either be overlapping or self-tending.|$|R
25|$|The Chinese have {{celebrated the}} harvest during the autumn full moon since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE). Morris Berkowitz, {{who studied the}} Hakka people during the 1960s, theorizes that the harvest celebration {{originally}} began with worshiping Mountain Gods after the harvest was completed. For the Baiyue peoples, the harvest time commemorated the dragon who brought rain for the crops. The celebration as a festival only started to gain popularity during the early Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). One legend explains that Emperor Xuanzong of <b>Tang</b> started to <b>hold</b> formal celebrations in his palace after having explored the Moon-Palace. The term mid-autumn (中秋) first appeared in Rites of Zhou, a written collection of rituals of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE).|$|R
40|$|The {{excavation}} of Paekche refugee epitaphs {{has increased in}} the 21 st century. Among them, the epitaphs of the Ye (禰) family are valuable materials to understand the fall of Paekche, Paekche refugee activity, and their native origins. However, all of the Ye family epitaphs contain different stories about their native origins. More specifically, the native origin and ancestors of the Ye family became more detailed and Sinicized over time. The record of their ancestors {{is likely to have}} been fabricated for the future survival of the descendants in the Tang. Although the exact native origin is not clear, it is almost certain that the Ye family lived in Paekche since at least the sixth century and had already become accustomed to Paekche language and culture. With this understanding, it is remarkable how they could have been active in the Tang, just after surrendering, and not in Silla. It was natural for Paekche officials to yield to the Tang because of the situation in both the Tang and Silla. However, other factors related to Paekche were also important. Because Paekche had maintained its cosmopolitan and open attitude coupled with their familiarity with the Chinese language and culture, the Ye family could emigrate to the <b>Tang</b> and <b>hold</b> high status in various fields in East Asia...|$|R
30|$|After {{the split}} of the Southern and Northern dynasties, the {{expanded}} Central Plains region unified {{again during the}} Sui and Tang Dynasties. The ruling class of the Tang Dynasty included many of mixed-ethnicity. At {{the time of its}} founding, the Han-icized Xianbei nobility played a pivotal supportive role, so they always had an important position within the resulting ruling class. Studies show that of the 369 ministers of the Tang Dynasty, 36 were of northern tribal origin, accounting for one tenth of the total. The Book of <b>Tang</b> also <b>holds</b> a special provision for biographies of those Northern generals. The Shatuo people were also quite dominant during the Tang and Song Dynasties. Among the Five Dynasties after the Tang, that is the late-Tang, late-Jin, and late-Jiang were all established by the Shatuo, and Zhuang Zong, who while famous for reviving the Tang Dynasty, was a Shatuo. So although the Tang Dynasty was nominally under Han rule, in reality it was under the rule of many ethnic groups. During the 500  years between the Tang and Song Dynasties, the Central Plains region was a melting pot, with the Han at its core. Many non-Han were integrated by the local Han people, and became Han themselves. Of course the process of integration was very complicated, but the result was that many surnames that existed in the history books, like Xianbei, Di, Jie, and others disappeared in real life.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Tang Jun {{became the}} focus of public {{controversy}} over his resume. In the first edition of his book My Success is Replicable, <b>Tang</b> claimed to <b>hold</b> a doctoral degree in computer science from California Institute of Technology (Caltech). However, Fang Zhouzi checked Caltech's alumni list and lists of doctoral dissertations, and found no records for Tang. Tang stated {{that he did not have}} a degree from Caltech, and that he had never claimed to have received a degree there, but had conducted research there. Fang asked Tang to provide information about the kind of research and the names of professors at Caltech Tang had worked with. So far, Tang has not provided any relevant information. It raises the question whether Tang has ever conducted any research at Caltech. Furthermore, Fang has also pointed out that Pacific Western University (Hawaii) was named in the United States Government General Accounting Office report to the United States Congress.On July 8, 2010, the publisher of Tang's book My Success is Replicable made an official announcement to clarify and apologize for the mistake. According to the publisher, due to communication insufficiency, they failed to find the mistake and correct it in time. On the second edition of the book, they made the correction.|$|R
