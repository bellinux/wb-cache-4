500|$|Through a {{collaboration}} with science consultant André Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature {{included on the}} DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of [...] "an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive" [...] as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: [...] "Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance." [...] Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: [...] "ven though <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing was wrong {{in terms of the}} actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs".|$|E
500|$|A {{low quality}} snippet of [...] "Frozen" [...] was leaked by fans on January 23, 1998, after it debuted on radio in Singapore, and posted {{it on the}} Internet. They said <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing was wrong, but that they hoped it would simply {{generate}} interest from Madonna. The song was played on the US radios, including the WKTU New York radio. Warner Bros. Records enlisted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s Anti-Piracy Unit to delete the Internet downloads of the song. Erik Bradley, musical director of Chicago B96, classified [...] "Frozen" [...] as a [...] "the mark of a smash. Clearly, American pop radio needs Madonna", after he played the track on his station. According to Jon Uren, marketing director of Warner Music Europe, the song also had [...] "fantastic" [...] early support across Europe. Shortly after the song leaked, a remix version of [...] "Frozen" [...] was broadcast by the BBC website, and also was previewed on the soundtrack at the 1998 Versace fashion spring parade. The single was released commercially on February 23, 1998 in the United States.|$|E

However, a spokesperson for the programme refuted the claims, saying [...] "Yes, it was long hours but <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> signing up for.

The poor, of course, only exchanged better for worse landlords, as they soon discovered. The [...] "Zealous Brethren"--as a rule small lairds, probably, and burgesses--were {{the nucleus of the}} Revolution. When townsfolk and yeomen in sufficient number had joined them in arms, then nobles like Argyll, Lord James, Glencairn, Ruthven, and the rest, put themselves {{at the head of the}} movement, and won the prizes which had been offered to the [...] "blind, crooked, widows, orphans, and all other poor." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I have no {{guarantee}} that {{any member of the}} majority of the Joint Select Committee ever heard of the Star Chamber or of Archbishop Laud. One of them did not know that politics meant anything more than party electioneering. Nothing is more alarming than the ignorance of our public men of the commonplaces of our history, and their consequent readiness to repeat experiments which have in the past produced national catastrophes. At all events, whether <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing or not, there can be no question as to what they did. They proposed virtually that the Act of the Long Parliament in 1641 shall be repealed, and the Star Chamber re-established, in order that playwrights and managers may be punished for unspecified offences unknown to the law. When I say unspecified, I should say specified as follows (see page xi. of the report) in the case of a play.|$|E
60|$|When {{such was}} {{the law of the}} land and the temper of those who {{administered}} it--judges and magistrates or landlords--what must the misery of the people have been to cause them to rise in revolt against their masters! They did nothing outrageous even in the height of their frenzy; they smashed the thrashing machines, burnt some ricks, while the maddest of them broke into a few houses and destroyed their contents; but they injured no man; yet <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> facing--the gallows or transportation to the penal settlements ready for their reception at the Antipodes. It is a pity that the history of this rising of the agricultural labourer, the most patient and submissive of men, has never been written. Nothing, in fact, has ever been said of it except from the point of view of landowners and farmers, but there is ample material for a truer and a moving narrative, not only in the brief reports in the papers of the time, but also in the memories of many persons still living, and of their children and children's children, preserved in many a cottage throughout the south of England.|$|E

60|$|Your Lordships well know, for {{you must}} be conversant {{in this kind of}} reading, that you once had before you a man of the highest rank in this country, one of the {{greatest}} men of the law and one of the greatest men of the state, a peer of your own body, Lord Macclesfield. Yet, my Lords, when that peer did but just modestly hint that he had received hard measure from the Commons and their Managers, those Managers thought themselves bound seriatim, one after another, to express the utmost indignation at the charge, in the harshest language that could be used. Why did they do so? They knew it was the language that became them. They lived in an age in which politeness was as well understood and as much cultivated as it is at present; but <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing, and they were resolved to use no language but what their ancestors had used, and to suffer no insolence which their ancestors would not have suffered. We tread in their steps; we pursue their method; we learn of them: and we shall never learn at any other school.|$|E
60|$|But {{after all}} we only need a Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds who really understands cats and thieves. Men hunt one animal {{differently}} from another; {{and the rich}} could catch swindlers as dexterously as they catch otters or antlered deer if they were really at all keen upon doing it. But then they never have an uncle with antlers; nor a personal friend who is an otter. When {{some of the great}} lords that lie in the churchyard behind me went out against their foes in those deep woods beneath I wager that they had bows against the bows of the outlaws, and spears against the spears of the robber knights. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> about; they fought the evildoers of their age with the weapons of their age. If the same common sense were applied to commercial law, in forty-eight hours it would be all over with the American Trusts and the African forward finance. But it will not be done: for the governing class either does not care, or cares very much, for the criminals, and as for me, I had a delusive opportunity of being Constable of Beaconsfield (with grossly inadequate powers), but I fear I shall never really be Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds.|$|E

But they presently regained their courage sufficiently to cross this chamber too and enter the short passageway that led to the ancient sleeping apartment of O-Mai the Cruel. They did not know that this awful chamber lay just before them, or it were doubtful that they would have proceeded farther; but they saw that those they sought had come this way and so they followed, but within the gloomy interior of the chamber they halted, the three chiefs urging their followers, in low whispers, to close in behind them, and there just within the entrance they stood until, their eyes becoming accustomed to the dim light, one of them pointed suddenly to the thing lying upon the floor with one foot tangled in the coverings of the dais.|$|E

6000|$|They marched out {{by night}} in good order, {{with all their}} guns and ammunition, and with immense plunder; as much of poor Montezuma's treasures as they could carry.

He sent her forward under a strong guard of Tlascalans, {{with all the other}} women. The great street was crossed by many canals. Then the causeway across the lake, two miles long, was crossed by more canals, and at every one of these the Indians had taken away the bridges. Cortez knew that, and had made a movable bridge; but he had only time to make one, and that of course had to be taken up at the rear, and carried forward to the front every time they crossed a dyke; and that made endless delay. As long {{as they were in the}} city, however, all went well; but the moment they came out upon the lake causeway, out thundered the serpent-skin drums from the top of every temple, the conch shells blew, and out swarmed the whole hive of bees, against the one brave wasp who was struggling. The Spaniards cleared the dyke by cavalry and artillery, and got to the first canal, laid down the bridge, and over slowly but safely, amid a storm of stones and arrows. They got to the second canal, fifteen or twenty feet broad. Why, in God's name, was not the bridge brought on? Instead of the bridge came news from the rear. The weight of the artillery had been too great for the bridge, and it was jammed fast. And there they were on a narrow dyke fifty feet broad, in the midst of the lake, in the dark midnight, with countless thousands of Indians, around, before, behind, and the lord have mercy on them! ...|$|E
