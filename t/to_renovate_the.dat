5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> airport.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{reservoirs}} for Liverpool Corporation in {{the mid-19th}} century led to {{a decrease in the}} population when farms were cleared, the valley flooded and property {{in the western part of}} the village demolished. William Lever bought the Rivington Hall estate at the turn of the 20th century and used his wealth <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> old barns and create a large public park.|$|E

5|$|Membership {{peaked in}} the 1920s, {{but with the}} onset of the Great Depression {{declined}} steadily, and by the 1970s the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary.

5|$|On {{the border}} of Southcote and Tilehurst is the Meadway Precinct, which {{includes}} an Asda supermarket and a Boots pharmacy, {{as well as other}} smaller shops. The precinct opened in 1967, and a survey in 2012 revealed that the public thought the site had become run-down and required modernisation. In 2015 a planning application was submitted to Reading Borough Council by a developer who plans <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{proposal}} in 2000 <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> interchange at Bradley Avenue. The next year, SANDAG approved {{the construction of a}} southern bypass of Ramona and widening from Vigilante Road to Dye Road for a cost of $200million as part of a 2030 transportation plan. The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a roundabout instead of widening the highway.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} on simulcasting of harness and quarter horse races was reached in August allowing Rosecroft to reopen on August 25, 2011.

5|$|Built in {{a modernist}} style, the {{building}} {{has been the subject}} of vigorous public debate about its heritage value. Some parties, such as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, consider the building to be an important example of modernist architecture in the city, whilst others consider it ugly. These conflicting views led to animosity in the 1990s, when the State Government refused to heritage list the property, and instead recommended its demolition. Despite this, the City of Perth opted <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> tower and keep it as its headquarters. Following this, the building was admitted to the State's Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{about the}} need to upgrade and {{renovate}} City Hall began anew in 1988.

Work was to include replacing the concrete floors, structural upgrades, and restoring the original light corridors that penetrated all four floors of the building. In March 1995, plans were made <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> then-100-year-old structure. The estimated $22-million project was proposed due to the building failing to comply with the city codes for earthquakes and fires.|$|E
5|$|Garrick {{commissioned}} Robert Adam and {{his brother}} James <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> theatre's interior, which they did in 1775. Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade {{was the first time}} any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became an interior hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade.|$|E

5|$|In early 2010, a {{real estate}} {{developer}} approached the Cacchios with an offer to purchase the theater. A 501(c) nonprofit organization was formed in March 2010 to preserve the building, which secured a $50,000 grant from PepsiCo to help take out a $385,000 mortgage. Since completing its purchase of the theater on August 19, 2010, the Rosendale Theatre Collective has added a digital projector, surround sound system, stage thrust, and retractable screen. The group plans to add a concession stand and move the ticket booth outside during warm months. In late February 2011, the theater received a $175,000 state grant <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used as a {{religious}} retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1944 {{the library}} was {{designated}} as a County Library System, qualifying it for state funding. Now with proper government funds to support it, {{the library was}} officially named the Augusta Public Library.

50|$|By {{the late}} 1960, {{the use of}} the theater declined. Plans were {{underway}} to demolish the theater and convert the space into a parking lot. In 1970, the venue was purchased by businessman and philanthropist, Maurice Gusman. He later hired famed local architect, Morris Lapidus <b>to</b> <b>renovated</b> <b>the</b> main auditorium. The capacity was reduced from 2,000 to 1,700. In 1972, <b>the</b> <b>renovated</b> theater became <b>the</b> home of the Greater Miami Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, {{responsible}} for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, {{one of the}} city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance of Bob Donnelly. The city would use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions with cable TV channel HBO to decide who would perform.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 2011, Virgin Hotels, part of Virgin Group, {{purchased}} {{the building with}} the aim of opening it as their first hotel in 2013 with approximately 250 rooms. The transaction was an all-cash deal that was valued at about $14 million. The company hired The John Buck Company <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> building. The lead architect for the renovation was Booth Hansen. The co-designers for the interior renovation were Rockwell Group Europe and Virgin Hotels' in-house design team. The purchase was part of Virgin Hotels' 2010 business plan to acquire distressed properties in North America cheaply during the property downturn.|$|E
5|$|Phantom's Revenge (formerly {{known as}} Steel Phantom) is a steel roller coaster at Kennywood. When {{it opened in}} 1991, it was the fastest roller coaster and had the longest drop of any roller coaster in the world. The ride was {{originally}} manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. After the 2000 season, D.H. Morgan Manufacturing was brought in <b>to</b> <b>renovate</b> <b>the</b> ride, most notably to remove the four inversions. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop through Thunderbolt's structure is longer than its first drop.|$|E
