The inner curtain wall was reduced to one storey in height, and the outer curtain wall was refaced.

The alternate method (Method 1) models the field situation better when the loadings at the bottom during filling are required, mimics the laboratory model tests, and gives the same stress profile for all stopes with any aspect ratio.

30|$|Although gob {{backfill}} is {{also called}} complete backfill, none of backfill techniques can obtain a filling ratio of 100  %. This is attributed not only <b>to</b> <b>backfilling</b> process and mechanical properties of backfill material (Karfakis et al. 1996), {{but also to}} the mining-induced motion law of roof strata. The filling ratio of < 100  % has been confirmed by practices of mining with backfill in different countries (Gandhe et al. 2005). Therefore, surface subsidence cannot be entirely avoided under backfilling. Typically, in the evaluation of surface subsidence under backfill, the term of effective extraction height is proposed (Singh and Singh 1985; Miao et al. 2010), which represents the actual thickness of voids transferred finally to the ground surface and is just part of the actual mining height. The ratio of effective extraction height to actual mining height is called subsidence factor under backfill.|$|R

40|$|Slurry {{trenches}} {{are often}} used to impede groundwater flow or to contain soil and groundwater contamination. The stability of the slurry trench during excavation and prior <b>to</b> <b>backfilling</b> {{is a major concern}} in design. A horizontal slice method for stability analysis of slurry trenches, which allows consideration of soil stratification, is presented. Vertical force equilibrium for each slice of the sliding mass and horizontal force equilibrium for the whole sliding mass are considered on the basis of limit equilibrium. The factor of safety is obtained via the Newton–Raphson method and the critical slip surface corresponding to the minimum factor of safety is located by the pattern search method. The proposed method is verified via consideration of a previously reported problem. It is then applied to a full-scale field experiment in three-layer soils. The obtained minimum factor of safety and location of the slip surface of the sliding mass are in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. Analyses of trenches having a weak layer at various depths demonstrate potential variations in slip surface inclination between soil layers...|$|R
