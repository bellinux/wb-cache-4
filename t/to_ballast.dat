5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and were converted <b>to</b> <b>ballast</b> motor cars, {{with the final}} one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E

25|$|The Finnpusku {{system uses}} a unique rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need <b>to</b> <b>ballast</b> the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side.

25|$|The {{conversion}} {{consisted of}} retrofitting a bulbous bow, faired {{to the existing}} icebreaker bow, to reduce the wave resistance and replacing the ice-strengthened propeller blades with more efficient highly skewed blades, designed by KaMeWa, to improve speed and fuel consumption. Six double-bottom tanks were converted from bunker <b>to</b> <b>ballast</b> water tanks while nine wing tanks were converted from ballast to heavy fuel oil and two to dedicated heeling tanks. The cargo-carrying capacity of the ships was increased by converting deep tanks between the cargo holds and below the lower deck in the bow for the carriage of vegetable oils. Their maximum allowable draught was increased to , which substantially increased the ships' deadweight tonnage. Other changes included upgrading the cargo handling and lifesaving equipment, converting ten cabins for passengers and installing a new incinerator {{to deal with the}} shipboard waste. The stern notch was also no longer needed and thus removed, but the Wärtsilä Air Bubbling system was retained for maneuvering.|$|E
25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need <b>to</b> <b>ballast</b> the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo.

2500|$|The weight {{distribution}} of the P-39 was supposedly the reason for its tendency to enter a dangerous flat spin, a characteristic Soviet test pilots were able to demonstrate to the skeptical manufacturer who {{had been unable to}} reproduce the effect. After extensive tests, it was determined the spin could only be induced if the aircraft was improperly loaded, with no ammunition in the front compartment. The flight manual noted a need <b>to</b> <b>ballast</b> the front ammunition compartment with the appropriate weight of shell casings to achieve a reasonable center of gravity. High-speed controls were light, consequently high-speed turns and pull-outs were possible. The P-39 had to be held in a dive since it tended to level out, reminiscent of the Spitfire.

2500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the September 1815 Christian Observer stated, [...] "To the poem of Roderick, Mr. Southey has annexed a voluminous collection of notes.

[...] The review concluded, [...] "Those productions, in the mean time, have a far more than compensating merit. On the present occasion, if the commentator of Roderick appears scarcely worthy of the poet, yet {{he must be a}} very fastidious, or a very dull reader, who does not find the evil of possessing the commentary, infinitely overpaid by the gratification of reading the poem." ...|$|E

25|$|Slab track {{can also}} {{generate}} significantly more noise pollution and cause more vibration than traditional ballasted track. While {{this is partly}} attributable to slab track's decreased sound absorption qualities, a more significant factor is that slab track typically uses softer rail fasteners to provide vertical compliance similar <b>to</b> <b>ballasted</b> track, and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail to vibrate over a greater length.|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} collision, Andrea Doria {{began to take}} on water and started to list {{severely}} to starboard. Within minutes, the list was at least 18°. After the ships separated, Captain Calamai quickly brought the engine controls to [...] "all stop". One of the watertight doors to the engine room may have been missing, though this issue was later determined to be moot. Much more importantly, however, crucial stability was lost by the earlier failure, during routine operations, <b>to</b> <b>ballast</b> the mostly empty fuel tanks as the builders had specified. (Filling the tanks with seawater as the fuel was emptied {{would have resulted in}} more costly procedures to refuel when port was reached). Owing to the immediate rush of seawater flooding the starboard tanks, and because the port tanks had emptied during the crossing, the list was greater than would otherwise have been the case. As it increased over the next few minutes to 20° or more, Calamai realized no hope was left for his ship unless the list could be corrected.|$|E
2500|$|The balloon {{envelopes}} used in {{the project}} are made by Raven Aerostar, and are composed of polyethylene plastic about [...] thick. The balloons are superpressure balloons filled with helium, standing [...] across and [...] tall when fully inflated. They carry a custom air pump system dubbed the [...] "Croce" [...] that pumps in or releases air <b>to</b> <b>ballast</b> the balloon and control its elevation. A small box weighing [...] containing each balloon's electronic equipment hangs underneath the inflated envelope. This box contains circuit boards that control the system, radio antennas and a Ubiquiti Networks 'Rocket M2' to communicate with other balloons and with Internet antennas on the ground, and batteries to store solar power so the balloons can operate during the night. Each balloon's electronics are powered by an array of solar panels that sit between the envelope and the hardware. In full sun, the panels produce 100 watts of power, which is sufficient to keep the unit running while also charging a battery for use at night. A parachute attached {{to the top of}} the envelope allows for a controlled descent and landing when a balloon is ready to be taken out of service. In the case of an unexpected failure, the parachute deploys automatically. When taken out of service, the balloon is guided to an easily reached location, and the helium is vented into the atmosphere. The balloons typically have a maximum life of about 100 days, although Google claims that its tweaked design can enable them to stay aloft for closer to 200 days.|$|E

It is also useful in renovating existing railroad tunnels. Because slab track allows shallower construction than ballasted track, it may provide the extra overhead clearance necessary for converting a line to overhead electrification, or allow the passage of trains with a greater loading gauge.|$|R
