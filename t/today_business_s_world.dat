40|$|This {{exercise}} {{takes place}} {{on the final day}} of class in my Business Communication course. The semester has been devoted, largely, to the idea that the fewer words used in business communication, the better. I use Coco Chanel 2 ̆ 7 s quote about accessories- 2 ̆ 2 Never add, always remove 2 ̆ 2 -as a guideline for composing and editing both writing and speech. The goal is to get students to realize that, in almost all business communication, less is more, especially in today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>business</b> <b>world</b> where much communication takes place electronically. But students also come to realize that 2 ̆ 2 less is more work 2 ̆ 2, and that concision and brevity are more difficult to come by than long, effusive communication...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the first commercial computer into the U. <b>S.</b> <b>business</b> <b>world</b> in the early 50 s, the use of computers has grown tremendously. Technology has been advancing at an unbelievable speed, which, on one hand, improves computer capability greatly, and on the other, lowers costs to the extent that even small businesses can afford one. Thus today, computer systems are being used in large and small organizations alike. Along with increases in computer usage, however, have come problems like invasion of privacy and computer-related crime. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the average loss for each reported computer crime is about $ 500, 000 compared with an average loss of $ 3, 200 for bank robberies and $ 23, 500 for bank frauds and embezzlement without computers. 1 But what's more striking is that only one percent of computer crimes are detected and of those detected, only 12 percent are reported to law enforcement authorities. ...|$|R

In <b>today</b> <b>s</b> <b>business</b> arena, portals are very important in getting information and service delivery efficiency and effectiveness; {{it has the potential}} to develop the performance of an organization in terms of productivity and business process efficiency. Portals are never ending projects and need modification from time to time to suit business requirements. However, portals can result in negative changes to business environment if developers and top management do not identify critical factors for sustainable utilization. Quality and acceptance in use factors must be blended together to make the portal more sustainable and highly utilized. Although the scope of this paper focuses on intranet portals in Higher Education Institutions (HEI); the idea can still be adapted to other organizations and knowledge workers. The insight forwarded by this conceptual paper could provide some basis for future studies in this domain, particularly regarding the factors for a sustainable portal; as well as the guidelines for practitioners to realize the portal need and value impact and also to place emphasis on portal utilization as a monitoring tool...|$|R

40|$|This {{graduate}} {{thesis is}} a study of production planning response to the erratic demand signals in short life cycle products. Governing short life cycle products have become a challenge in today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>business</b> <b>world</b> as their potential to generate profits to the firm has come under tight scrutiny from both strategic and tactical perspectives. In this scenario, profits generated from new products would hinge on careful execution of the production plans {{in response to the}} demand in the market. However, that execution requires detailed analysis of the demand signals, dynamic demand-sales interactions and corresponding development of production plans which minimizes costs and maximizes sales profits associated with the product. We first do an extensive literature review on the various treatments of short lifecycle products. We come to realize that the research done in this area is very limited and is in its infancy. We focus our attention towards the development of production strategies for short lifecycle products. We develop generalized mathematical cost model to better explain the demand-supply interaction that occurs in short life cycle products. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
