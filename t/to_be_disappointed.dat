5|$|Hogg {{gained the}} {{position}} of revising barrister for Northumberland and Berwick in 1838. This required him to travel to Northern England twice a year. Jane often complained about these trips, but Hogg enjoyed visiting the north. He hoped that his legal service would earn him an appointment as a judge, but he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{staff at}} Canada Post's Montreal office were noticing a {{considerable}} number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did not want the writers, mostly young children, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves.|$|E
25|$|If the Percys and {{the other}} English knights thought they had gained great {{immediate}} riches from ransoms, they were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> They received a message from King Henry congratulating them their victory but forbidding the release of any of their prisoners.|$|E
50|$|What had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing</b> for Colman <b>was</b> being a non-roster {{player for}} the Yankees when they {{defeated}} the Brooklyn Dodgers in seven {{games for the}} 1947 World Series championship.|$|R
50|$|El Gobernador, a 4-10-0 {{locomotive}} {{built in}} the Central Pacific shops in Sacramento in 1884. Found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing</b> in its performance as a freight hauler, it was scrapped in July 1894.|$|R
5|$|William Fichtner as Bill , Dean's {{psychiatrist}} {{father who}} uses Dean {{as the subject}} of his books. Though he spends his life always looking for potential new material, his book sales turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing.</b>|$|R
25|$|If Rauhe's rivals hoped this {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a decline in the German's fortunes they were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> In 2006 Rauhe was back on top form and won more titles than ever before. At the European Championships in Račice, Czech Republic he won three gold medals, retaining his K-2 500 m title, regaining the K-1 200 m crown from Pérez and winning the K-2 200 m {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} can {{be considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} computer, with mathematician Charles Babbage having designed the world's first computing system as early as the mid-1800s. Alan Turing went on to devise what is essentially the basis for modern computing and Maurice Wilkes later created the first programmable computer. The webcam was also invented at Cambridge University, as a means for scientists to avoid interrupting their research and going {{all the way down to}} the laboratory dining room only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by an empty coffee pot.|$|E
25|$|In 737, Áed Allán {{met with}} Cathal at Terryglass, {{probably}} neutral ground outwith {{the control of}} either king. Byrne {{says that it is}} unlikely that Cathal acknowledged Áed Allán's authority—the Uí Néill had little enough influence in the south—but if Cathal had expected some benefit from the meeting, where he perhaps acknowledged the ecclesiastical supremacy of Armagh, he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> However, the clerics of Armagh may have been well satisfied as the Annals of Ulster, in the entry following that which reports the meeting of Cathal and Áed Allán, say that the law of Patrick was in force in Ireland. The presumably means that they agreed to the special treatment of the church, its lands and its tenants, as prescribed by the law of Patrick.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, regular {{featured}} programs {{found on}} CNN's American services <b>were</b> unavailable <b>to</b> Pipeline users. This fact {{was not made}} clear in advertisements for the service, so some American or Canadian users expecting online access to CNN and Headline News <b>to</b> which they <b>were</b> accustomed <b>to</b> <b>were</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rewind (Find a Way) was {{the second}} single <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{released}} of Beverley Knight's second studio album, Prodigal Sista. After {{the success of the}} first single Made It Back, which peaked at #21 in UK Singles Chart, the follow-up proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing</b> after it peaked at #40.|$|R
50|$|Wirth also {{designed}} Virgin's second F1 car, the MVR-02, but its performance proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing</b> as {{it failed to}} close the gap to the leaders relative to the VR-01. In June 2011, Virgin announced that it had parted company with Wirth and abandoned its policy of only using CFD.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} two years of Fianna Fáil government, the IRA's {{membership}} grew from a low of 1,800 to over 10,000. This can be put down to the radicalising impact of the Great Depression on the population, to which the IRA's new social radicalism (see next section) appealed. Another important factor was the formation of the Blueshirts: a quasi-fascist organisation set up by Eoin O'Duffy, originally composed of Civil war veterans of the Free State Army. The IRA and the Blueshirts both attacked political meetings and also fought street brawls against each other. While most of the fighting was conducted with fists or boots, at least one Blueshirt and one IRA man were shot dead in these clashes. IRA leaders saw in these events the beginnings of a republican revolution and the overthrow of the Free State. They were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though, again a tough semi-final awaited against {{defending}} {{world champions}} Spain. The victory value was huge: the dreamed Olympic final, guaranteed silver {{and a chance}} at gold, while also providing {{the opportunity to take}} back on the 66–91 shellacking during preparations. Both teams played at their best, with Spain compensating the absence of José Calderón to lead by the first quarter, only for Lithuania to dominate for the following two and having a minimal 74–73 advantage by the fourth. Then rising performances by Rudy Fernandez and Pau Gasol (9 and 7 points respectively) during the concluding quarter along with the Lithuanians' exhaustion and lack of big men input lead the Spanish to barely edge and win the semifinal 91–86. Head coach Ramūnas Butautas said that the team played well and there was no need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Through his {{association}} with Neave, Gow {{was introduced to the}} inner circles of the Conservative Party. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Margaret Thatcher in May 1979 at the time she became Prime Minister. While serving in this capacity between 1979 and 1983, Gow became a close friend and confidant of the Prime Minister. He was deeply involved in the workings of Thatcher's private office until his departure in June 1983. Though elevated to junior ministerial office as Minister for Housing and Construction before moving later to the Treasury, Gow was known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by his loss of influence with the Prime Minister in his new role. In late 1983 he developed plans with Alan Clark to reinvigorate Thatcher's private office by expanding it and its influence over policy, thereby creating a new role for himself, but these came to nothing.|$|E
50|$|Their second album, Sylentiger, was {{released}} in 1990. It featured a harder sound and lyrics which the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music characterised as presesting a need for salvation with a viewpoint from arminian theology. In retrospect HM magazine editor Doug Van Pelt found the record <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing</b> compared <b>to</b> their debut.|$|R
50|$|The {{competing}} {{proposals were}} rejected; those who favoured {{a line from}} Newport <b>to</b> Ryde <b>were</b> <b>disappointed,</b> and continued the struggle.|$|R
50|$|After {{adding an}} 11th-place finish {{at the next}} Pro Tour in London {{the rest of the}} 1999-2000 season turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing.</b> He <b>was</b> not able <b>to</b> make it beyond the first round in any of the newly {{introduced}} Masters events nor did he finish better than Top 64 at any of the succeeding Pro Tours.|$|R
25|$|In 1971, Giger and Tobler visited {{director}} Fredi M. Murer in London. Murer filmed a TV documentary, entitled Passagen (1972), about Giger's work. The documentary {{also featured}} interviews by both Giger and Tobler. In the 1972–1973 season, Tobler gained {{a part in}} the play My Woman, My Leader and had to travel all around Switzerland. Physically and mentally exhausted after 130 performances of the play, weary after the hectic schedule that required extensive touring around the country, and confused by her promiscuous erotic life, Tobler decided to take a leave of absence from the acting profession, as well as from her relationship with Giger. In 1974, she opted for leaving him and moving to San Francisco with her new American boyfriend. However, 30 days later, she returned to Zürich, claiming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> over the United States (as well as incapable of adapting to American lifestyle, according to Giger) and resuming her relationship with the painter.|$|E
25|$|Captain George Nicholas Hardinge (11 April 1781 – 8 March 1808) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Navy who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Possessing an ability to endear himself to senior {{officers}} through his intellect and good manners, he served under several important naval commanders, whose patronage allowed him to rise through the ranks. His own skill and bravery were also important factors in his promotion to his own command, a fact he demonstrated in 1804 when he led a daring cutting-out operation against two Dutch ships. Promotion to post captain left him temporarily without a command, and he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> in a number of the ships he was offered when {{they turned out to be}} either unfit for service, or still under construction. Having ended up in the East Indies he was forced to make do with an elderly frigate he had first served on as a midshipman much earlier in his career. While commanding this ship he fought an action with a superior French opponent, and after a gruelling three-day battle the British were victorious and the French captain surrendered. Hardinge did not live to see the moment, having been killed by grapeshot shortly before. He was buried with full military honours and monuments to his memory were erected in St. Thomas Cathedral, Bombay and St Paul's Cathedral, London.|$|E
500|$|Writer {{and activist}} Seth Finkelstein noted that predictably several critics would label Carr's {{argument}} as a Luddite one, {{and he was}} not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> when one critic later maintained that Carr's [...] "contrarian stance [...] slowly forcing him into a caricature of Luddism". Then, journalist David Wolman, in a Wired magazine piece, described as [...] "moronic" [...] the assumption that the web [...] "hurts us more than it helps", a statement that was preceded by an overview of the many technologies that had been historically denounced; Wolman concluded that the solution was [...] "better schools as well as a renewed commitment to reason and scientific rigor so that people can distinguish knowledge from garbage".|$|E

50|$|During {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century the railway {{experienced}} a rapid growth in freight traffic and by 1905 their locomotives were no longer capable of hauling the heaviest trains without loss of time. Douglas Earle Marsh's initial response <b>was</b> <b>to</b> introduce his C3 class with a larger boiler in 1906, but the performance of these also proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite its success, {{numbers in}} service with the RFC {{actually}} started to decline from spring 1918, mainly {{due to a}} shortage of engines, and production switched to the DH.9, which turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing,</b> being inferior <b>to</b> the DH.4 in most respects. It <b>was</b> left <b>to</b> the further developed DH.9A, with the American Liberty engine, to satisfactorily replace the DH.4.|$|R
500|$|The book's second segment, [...] "One Holy Night", {{contains}} two short narratives focusing on adolescent females {{and the way}} their self-worth {{is affected by the}} tension of remaining loyal to Mexico while integrating into the American lifestyle. [...] The title story [...] "One Holy Night" [...] introduces the reader to a young teenage girl, Ixchel, who, in her quest for true love, meets a 37-year-old man named Chato. He lies to her about belonging to ancient Mayan royalty, seduces her, and then abandons her, only to return in an attempt to kill her. In her youth and naivety, Ixchel desires to be romanced by someone with alleged Mexican roots, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the reality of having fallen in love with a Mexican-American serial killer.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Gene Wilder said {{he chose}} not to see the film. [...] "The thing that put me off ... I like Johnny Depp, I like him, as an actor I like him very much ... but when I saw little pieces in the {{promotion}} of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> in him." [...] In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton remake, he said [...] "I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult." [...] He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying [...] "I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic gave {{a mostly}} {{positive}} {{review of the}} album, commenting that [...] "fans of Arjona's straight-ahead rock style are sure <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> with much of 5to Piso, as piano and strings drive much of the music rather than the electric guitar and drums of years past." [...] Billboards Leila Cobo, on her review of the album, commented that the singer had [...] "an uncanny knack for marrying sophisticated lyrics with catchy hooks and mass-appeal messages", stating that songs like [...] "Ni Tu Ni Yo", a duet with Paquita la del Barrio, [...] "underscores how universal" [...] his songs and themes are, [...] "even in the most regional arrangements." [...] 5to Piso received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album and a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Singer-Songwriter Album though lost to Sin Frenos and Caetano Veloso respectively.|$|E
50|$|A new ore deposit, {{of which}} the ore was worth $1,000 a ton, was found by Stott and Martinez. Six of their claims were optioned for $100,000 by John McGee, but {{the quality of the}} ore in the deposit turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing.</b> This led <b>to</b> people leaving Athens in the end of 1910. In December, the mining camp was totally deserted.|$|R

40|$|The Reformatsky {{reaction}} with t-butyl haloacetate {{could be}} effected {{in the presence}} of lithium or aluminum, but the latter metal proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing</b> as a condensing agent.

500|$|Final Fantasy Adventure was {{featured}} in Nintendo Power when it was re-released in the United States. The game holds an aggregated score of 79.07% approval rating on Game Rankings based on seven reviews. IGN praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to , though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. RPGFan also praised the game stating it was [...] "possibly {{the best thing that}} ever happened to Gameboy." [...] RPGamer praised the game's plot stating,"The story is one where you can relate to the characters and also the world around them." [...] Ndojo also gave similar praise to the game however noting it being vastly different from Final Fantasy stating, [...] "If you’re expecting Final Fantasy in the traditional sense, you’re going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> However, if you play the game for a while, you just might find that it’s equally entertaining in its own fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|Hand {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> in {{his progress}} at work. A {{move to the}} firm of Gould & Wilkie in January 1904 brought neither the challenges nor the financial rewards {{for which he had}} hoped. [...] "I was never any good as a lawyer," [...] he later admitted. [...] "I didn't have any success, any at all." [...] In 1907, deciding that at the age of 35 success as a Wall Street lawyer was out of reach, he lobbied for a potential new federal judgeship in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the federal court headquartered in Manhattan. He became involved briefly in local Republican politics to strengthen his political base. In the event, Congress did not create the new judgeship in 1907; but, when the post was finally created in 1909, Hand renewed his candidacy. With the help of the influential Charles C. Burlingham, a senior New York lawyer and close friend, he gained the backing of Attorney General George W. Wickersham, who urged President William Howard Taft to appoint Hand. One of the youngest federal judges ever appointed, Hand took his judicial oath at age 37 in April 1909.|$|E
500|$|Dowling was {{appointed}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1957 New Year Honours, and completed his term as CNS on 23February 1959. On 23March {{he took over}} from Sir Henry Wells as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), a role foreshadowing that of the latter-day Chief of the Defence Force. He was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral Henry Burrell. Happily surprised by his appointment as Chairman of COSC, Dowling hoped to transform the position such that it would exercise command authority over the service chiefs, but in this he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> The position's rank remained {{the same as the}} heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and was only responsible for putting their views on military matters to the Minister for Defence. Other setbacks during his tenure included the Defence Department's decision—rescinded after his term—to disband the Fleet Air Arm, and the Federal government's failure to back him when he announced at a SEATO press conference in March 1961 that Australia was prepared to intervene militarily in the second Laotian crisis should it become necessary. In September 1959, during the first Laotian crisis, the Australian government had authorised Dowling to commit [...] "an infantry battalion, a squadron of RAAF fighters, air transport, and two RAN destroyers" [...] to support US and SEATO forces, but no intervention took place.|$|E
5000|$|During {{her short}} career, TK had some {{considerable}} legal wrangles, the first; surrounding her stage name [...] "TK", {{with that of}} similar sounding Kwaito group TKZ. The second turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing,</b> when she <b>was</b> offered a seven-record deal with UK-based label Polydor shortly {{after the release of}} her first album. This deal was quickly revoked after threats from the local producers of the album.|$|R
50|$|Having {{fled the}} police, and Leon Zissell's henchmen, after a fancy-dress {{party in the}} Roman Baths at Bath, Steve and Dinah (with the rest of Steve's gang - and the police - in hot pursuit) make their way towards Devon. Steve's {{encounter}} with Louie <b>is</b> <b>disappointing.</b> Louie recognises Dinah instantly (because of her TV celebrity) but fails to recognise Steve and misremembers his name, even after being introduced. Dinah's island also proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing.</b> At low tide it is reachable from the mainland, and Zissell (who is clearly besotted with Dinah) has already arrived.|$|R
50|$|However, Dopita's {{time in the}} NHL <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointing.</b> He {{recorded}} respectable totals getting limited ice {{time with}} Philadelphia, including a four-goal game against the Atlanta Thrashers, but a knee injury limited him to 52 games. After the season, his rights <b>were</b> traded <b>to</b> the Edmonton Oilers, where he <b>was</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a top-two centre. However, Dopita had a terrible season, recording only six points in 21 games.|$|R
