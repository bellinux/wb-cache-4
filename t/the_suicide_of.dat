40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} crisis intervention in three secondary schools after <b>the</b> <b>suicides</b> <b>of</b> five students, {{focusing on the}} relation between crisis intervention and <b>suicide</b> contagion. <b>The</b> contagion hypothesis was supported. Following a <b>suicide,</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>suicides</b> that occurred in secondary schools in one year were markedly increased beyond chance. No new suicides took place at schools where adequate first talk-throughs and psychological debriefing were conducted by a mental health professional. Proper crisis intervention is recommended to prevent suicide contagion in schools...|$|R

5|$|While it is {{unproven}} that Sejanus {{intended to}} overthrow Tiberius, later prefects of the Guard did aspire to become emperor. Upon <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Nero in AD 68, the Guard prefect Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus attempted to have himself declared emperor, on the pretence {{that he was}} the illegitimate son of Caligula. The attempt failed and Sabinus was killed by his soldiers. In the early 3rd century, Plautianus was executed after a failed conspiracy against Septimius Severus. According to sources, the downfall of Plautianus was largely due to suspicion of Severus' son Caracalla, who was later murdered and replaced by his Praetorian prefect Marcus Opellius Macrinus.|$|E
