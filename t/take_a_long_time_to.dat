5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach the Solar System, once there {{they would be able}} to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> fledge. In {{the case}} of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|The SSEM had a 32-bit {{word length}} and {{a memory of}} 32words (1 kilobit). As it was {{designed}} to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E

5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E

25|$|While Yukon {{is mostly}} covered with forests, {{most of the}} trees are small and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grow and {{regenerate}} because of the dry cold climate.

25|$|The {{initial cost}} of CFLs and LEDs {{are higher than}} that of {{incandescent}} light bulbs.

Chronic wounds <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> heal and patients can suffer from chronic wounds for many years. Chronic wound healing may be compromised by coexisting underlying conditions, such as venous valve backflow, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled edema and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened {{is part of his}} plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grow into or assume the divine likeness.|$|E
25|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{is due to}} {{the complexity}} of plasma processes.

The influence of process parameters on the chemical composition of the resultant polymer means it can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> determine the optimal conditions. The complexity of the process also makes it impossible to theorize what the resultant polymer will look like, unlike conventional polymers which can be easily determined based on the monomer.|$|E

25|$|Sodium thiopental is {{not used}} to {{maintain}} anesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness. Sodium thiopental {{would have to be}} given in large amounts to maintain an anesthetic plane, and because of its 11.5- to 26-hour half-life, consciousness would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> return.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} RAID-Z modes: RAID-Z1 (similar to RAID5, allows one disk to fail), RAID-Z2 (similar to RAID6, allows two disks to fail), and RAID-Z3 (Also {{referred to as}} RAID7 allows three disks to fail). The need for RAID-Z3 arose recently because RAID configurations with future disks (say, 6–10TB) may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> repair, the worst case being weeks. During those weeks, {{the rest of the}} disks in the RAID are stressed more because of the additional intensive repair process and might subsequently fail, too. By using RAID-Z3, the risk involved with disk replacement is reduced.|$|E

25|$|A third {{example is}} the {{determination}} of the salary for work performed. Whether we reckon using the Stelo system or not, wages are a matter of daily concern. All industrialized countries must contend with inflation, which continuously gnaws away at the family budget, and the only remedy is the continuing increase of salaries. Especially in the industrialized world, wage negotiations can lead to sometimes bitter confrontation between employers and labour unions. In developing countries lacking a strong tradition of labour relations law, these confrontations can result in human rights abuses or even in police or military intervention. After a strike or lockout has concluded it may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> regain an atmosphere of mutual confidence and trust. Esperantist economists believe that the application of the Stelo to labour-management negotiations could prevent these problems.|$|E
25|$|Employees {{wages and}} {{pensions}} have preferential status, but {{only up to}} an £800 limit, a figure which has remained unchanged since 1986. Employees having priority among creditors, albeit not above fixed security holders, dates back to 1897, and is justified {{on the ground that}} employees are particularly incapable, unlike banks, of diversifying their risk, and forms one of the requirements in the ILO Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention. Often this limited preference is not enough, and can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> realise. Reflecting the Insolvency Protection Directive under ERA 1996 section 166 any employee may lodge a claim with the National Insurance Fund for outstanding wages. Under ERA 1996 section 182 the amount claimable is the same as that for unfair dismissal (£350 in 2010) for a limit of 8 weeks. If an employee has been unpaid for a longer period, she may choose the most beneficial 8 weeks.|$|E
