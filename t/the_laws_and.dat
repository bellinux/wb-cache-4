5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{administration}} of justice at village level was the responsibility of village assemblies, which usually consisted of the elders of the village.

Several rock inscriptions that record these proclamations have been found in archaeological excavations. Punishments differed from ruler to ruler. Some kings, such as Sanghabodhi (247–249) and Voharika Tissa (209–231) were lenient in this aspect, while rulers like Ilanaga (33–43) and Jetthatissa I (263–273) were harsher. However, crimes such as treason, murder and slaughter of cattle were generally punishable by death.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Law</b> <b>and</b> Society is an American movement, {{which was}} {{established}} after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had {{a vested interest in}} <b>the</b> study of <b>law.</b> <b>The</b> rationale of <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>and</b> Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by Lawrence Friedman: [...] "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers". Its founders believed that the [...] "study of <b>law</b> <b>and</b> legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods". The establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>and</b> Society Association in 1964 <b>and</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>and</b> Society Review in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>and</b> Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.|$|R

5|$|The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I {{is a legal}} treatise, {{written in}} about 1115, that records the legal customs of medieval England in the reign of King Henry I of England.

It lists and explains <b>the</b> <b>laws,</b> <b>and</b> includes explanations of how to conduct legal proceedings. Although its title implies that these laws were issued by King Henry, it lists laws issued by earlier monarchs that were still in force in Henry's reign; the only law of Henry that is included is the coronation charter he issued at the start of his reign. It covers a diverse range of subjects, including ecclesiastical cases, treason, murder, theft, feuds, assessment of danegeld, and the amounts of judicial fines.|$|E

At the summit was the king whose kingship was hereditary; he was usually succeeded by his eldest son. Next in the hierarchy stood the adikaris who were the provincial administrators. Then came the mudaliyars who functioned as judges and interpreters of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> customs of the land. It was also their duty to gather information of whatever {{was happening in the}} provinces and report to higher authorities. Administrators of revenues called kankanis or superintendents and kanakkappillais or accountants came next in line. These were also known as pandarapillai. They had to keep records and maintain accounts.|$|E

5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner {{considered}} it an unresolved issue. In his inaugural speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result.
