5|$|<b>The</b> <b>national</b> <b>title</b> {{game was}} a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a {{time-out}} that Michigan didn't have with seconds left. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship {{due to an}} unforced error by the opposing team.|$|E
5|$|After the Hokies' {{participation}} in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game, the Virginia Tech entered the 2000-2001 college football season with high expectations. Until late in the season, those hopes were borne out, and it appeared as if the Hokies {{would return to the}} national championship game. After a late-season loss to No.3-ranked Miami, however, Tech was knocked out of contention for <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title.</b> Following the conclusion of its 10–1 season, No. 6 Tech was selected to participate in the Gator Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the No. 16 Clemson Tigers, who had finished 9–2 during the regular season.|$|E

They {{finished the}} season as the consensus National Champions, being voted No.1 in the AP and Coaches' Polls in securing Alabama's first national title since 1992.

5|$|E. Between and {{including}} the 1982 and 1990 seasons, the Swedish football championship was decided not by the final standings in Allsvenskan, but by a play-off held following the Allsvenskan season, which pitted the four best-placed clubs {{against each other in}} a two-legged cup format. The Malmö FF team won Allsvenskan five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, but had to contest these play-offs each time to claim <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title.</b> Though they won the play-offs in 1986 and 1988, they failed to do so in 1985, 1987 and 1989, and therefore were not Swedish champions those years.|$|E
5|$|Meissner {{began the}} 2006–07 {{season at the}} 2006 Skate America, where she won the silver medal, the highest finish of her career until then at a Grand Prix event. At her second Grand Prix event, the 2006 Trophée Eric Bompard, she fell on a triple Axel attempt and placed third overall. At the 2007 U.S. Championships, Meissner went in as the favorite. She won the title, after winning the short program and placing third in the free skate.

5|$|After Pierroth, Jr. won {{the title}} in 1995, he left CMLL and signed with AAA, {{bringing}} the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship with him. When Máscara Sagrada became the champion in 1996, it was officially acknowledged by the Commission that AAA controlled the booking of the championship {{from that point}} forward. El Halcón, also billed as Halcón Ortiz and Super Halcón, has the record for most championship reigns, with five. On September 13, 2006, AAA created the new AAA Mega Championship and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>title</b> was not promoted in the promotion. The then champion, Charly Manson left AAA in 2009 and defended the title on the independent circuit. Manson later lost the championship to Héctor Garza until his death on May 23, 2013, after which it became inactive once more. In October 2017 CMLL announced that they were bringign the championship back under their control.|$|E
5|$|Burke stated on March 27 that {{he would}} almost {{certainly}} enter the draft if Michigan won <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title.</b> On April 9 before boarding the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four, head coach Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek {{the advice of the}} NBA advisory committee. The draft board had until April 15 to develop each individual report and the players have until April 28 to enter the draft.

5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title.</b> This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after {{finishing}} his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, Johns Hopkins {{dominated}} the series, winning 12 of 13 games, including nine {{by an average}} margin of 5.6 points. During this period Hopkins, led by head coach Henry Ciccarone, won three national titles. By 1987, Maryland's fourth-year head coach Dick Edell had helped revitalize the Terrapins as a national power. Maryland posted an 11–0 record during the regular season, where the win over Hopkins, 11–7, was the only game decided by less than six goals. In the NCAA tournament, Maryland defeated Penn in the quarterfinals, 12–8, and advanced to again meet Hopkins in the semifinals. Despite having recorded its first three-loss season in over a decade, and having edged North Carolina in the quarterfinals, the Blue Jays upset the Terrapins, 13–8. Hopkins, led by goalkeeper Quint Kessenich, advanced to win <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title</b> against then undefeated Cornell in the final.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 run for <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title,</b> Smith used {{a method}} that was {{introduced}} to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Oklahoma {{promoted}} Bud Wilkinson, then {{an assistant}} coach, to head coach. Wilkinson led the Sooners to national championships in 1950, 1955, and 1956, {{as well as}} a stretch of 47 consecutive victories that began in 1953 and ended in 1957. Wilkinson's tenure included a streak of 13consecutive conference championships (in addition to one by his predecessor). Oklahoma continued to perform well after Wilkinson left, but only returned to <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title</b> picture following the hiring of Barry Switzer in 1973. Switzer began similarly to Wilkinson, with eight consecutive conference championships in addition to national championships in 1974 and 1975. Switzer added Oklahoma's sixth national championship in 1985.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Navy {{became the}} first team other than Hopkins to defeat Maryland since 1954. That same year marked the start of Navy's eight-year {{national}} championship streak that lasted through 1967. That season, Navy beat Maryland 10–8, before traveling to Homewood Field. There, Johns Hopkins upset Navy, 9–6, {{for the first time}} in their last ten meetings. The Blue Jays and Terrapins met for the season finale where Hopkins needed a victory to win <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title</b> outright. Maryland acted as a spoiler, however, and beat Johns Hopkins, 9–5, to take a share of the championship. Hopkins went on to win or share the next four national titles.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{returned}} to his alma mater, and became the head coach in 1984 after the retirement of Henry Ciccarone. That year, he led the Blue Jays to a perfect 14–0 season and became the first head coach to win an NCAA championship in his first season. In 1985, Hopkins again won <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title</b> while suffering one loss. The following year, the Blue Jays compiled a 10–2 record, and were eliminated in the semifinals in overtime by the eventual national champions, North Carolina. In 1987, Zimmerman led the team to a 10–3 record and a third title. Upon expiration of his contract, he left Hopkins after compiling a 6–5 record in 1990. The reason he cited was the pressure associated with the high-profile position. In total, Zimmerman's teams at Johns Hopkins posted a 73–15 record.|$|E

5|$|Nurmi {{refused to}} turn professional, and {{continued}} running as amateur in Finland. In 1933, {{he ran his}} first 1500 m in three years and won <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>title</b> with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost.

With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career.
