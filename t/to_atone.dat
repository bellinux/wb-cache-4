5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} he {{considers}} The Kite Runner to be a father–son story, emphasizing the familial {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts <b>to</b> <b>atone</b> for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E
5|$|Queen Elizabeth {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} the Chest of Saint Simeon in 1381. The chest, located in Zadar, is of great importance for the history of the city, as it depicts various historical events– such as the death of her father– and Elizabeth herself.

5|$|Klein had {{the power}} to make or break {{academic}} careers, so Born felt compelled <b>to</b> <b>atone</b> by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became more interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E
5|$|Mermaids {{from the}} Isle of Man, known as ben-varrey, are {{considered}} more favorable toward humans {{than those of}} other regions, with various accounts of assistance, gifts and rewards. One story tells of a fisherman who carried a stranded mermaid back into the sea and was rewarded with the location of treasure. Another recounts {{the tale of a}} baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace <b>to</b> <b>atone</b> for the theft. A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of apples to a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking <b>to</b> <b>atone</b> {{for their actions}} {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E

2500|$|Those {{individuals}} who were unable to complete their ritual duties were disposed of in a much less honorary matter. This “insult to the gods” needed <b>to</b> be <b>atoned</b> therefore the sacrifice was slain while being chastised instead of revered.

50|$|Likewise, {{the ritual}} of the Red Heifer at Numbers 9:1-13, in which water of {{cleansing}} is produced, is generally thought by academic criticism to be early. The idea of this liquid, with which to wash away ritual uncleanliness, is thus thought to have become superseded by the more naturalistic idea that such uncleanliness merely needs <b>to</b> be <b>atoned</b> for, by a sacrificial offering, an idea represented elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} that is going on, remaining unaffected by {{the changes in the}} timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it <b>to</b> <b>atone</b> for her past actions. On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as a galley slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who {{has been charged with}} destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts <b>to</b> <b>atone</b> in the Roman way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E
5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the {{physical}} description of the savior. During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to take place on the final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes <b>to</b> <b>atone</b> for past actions by doing so.|$|E
60|$|If such an {{incident}} did happen, Shirley, reflecting what a ruin of peaceful and humble hopes had been {{wrought by the}} cold policy of the statesman and the iron band of the warrior, might have drawn a deep moral from it. It should have taught him that the poor man's hearth is sacred, and that armies and nations {{have no right to}} violate it. It should have made him feel that England's triumph and increased dominion could not compensate <b>to</b> mankind nor <b>atone</b> <b>to</b> Heaven for the ashes of a single Acadian cottage. But it is not thus that statesmen and warriors moralize.|$|R
