25|$|According to Arthur Ahkinga, {{who lived}} on Little Diomede island {{at the turn of}} the 1940s, the Iñupiat on the island made their living by hunting and carving ivory which they traded or sold. Fish they caught were bullheads, tomcods, bluecods and a few others, {{although}} the fishing was not so common. During the winter time they used fur parkas and skin mukluks made out of hunted animals to protect themselves from cold and wind. Recreations were skating, snowshoeing, handball, football and Inuit dancing. After dark, people spent <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> telling jokes and old-time stories. In summer time they travelled with skin boats equipped with outboard motors to either Siberia or Wales, Alaska. Winter travel was limited to neighboring Big Diomede due to weather conditions. Between July and October half the population went to Nome for selling their carving and skin sewing and trading for supplies.|$|E
500|$|In early September 1962 in Modesto, California, on {{the last}} evening of summer vacation, recent high school {{graduates}} and longtime friends, Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander, meet John Milner, the drag-racing king of the town, and Terry [...] "The Toad" [...] Fields {{in the parking lot}} of the local Mel's Drive-In diner. Curt and Steve are scheduled to travel the next morning to Northeastern United States to start college. Despite receiving a $2,000 scholarship from the local Moose Lodge, Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto. Steve gives Toad his 1958 Chevrolet Impala to watch while he's away at college until he returns at Christmas. Steve's girlfriend, Laurie, who is also Curt's sister, arrives in her car. Steve suggests to Laurie, who is already glum about him going to college, that they see other people while he is away in order to [...] "strengthen" [...] their relationship. Though not openly upset, she is displeased with his proposal which affects their interactions <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|E

[...] Throughout <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> the two chases continued. Then after darkness fell Levrette {{was able to}} outrun and escape from St Albans. Swiftsure however remained in touch with Atalante so that by 04:00 on 6 May the French frigate was approximately [...] ahead of the ship of the line to the northwest, with the wind direction to the north-northeast. For the entire following day Linois could not escape Boyles' pursuit, and at 17:30 Swiftsure {{was close enough to}} open fire again, using the bow-chasers {{for an hour and a}} half until Atalante once more pulled out of range. During the evening the French frigate was able to keep [...] in front of Swiftsure, but at midnight Linois switched his course to the south, hoping that the darkness would cloak the manoeuvre and that Atlante would be able to escape Boyles.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Roman White, debuted on June 21, 2007. It depicts McEntire and Clarkson as 1930's Hollywood lounge singers. In the video, McEntire encounters Clarkson attempting to conceal a bruise inflicted by the latter's abusive partner. When Clarkson's boyfriend is fighting with her, McEntire leaves the dressing room. While performing on stage, Clarkson witnesses her boyfriend played by Andrew M. Springer flirting with another woman. After the performance, she smashes a vase out of anger {{in the dressing}} room. Her boyfriend enters the room to take her out for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> Though apprehensive, Clarkson leaves on his arm before looking back uncertainly at McEntire, who uncomfortably fiddles with a hairbrush as she watches them leave. The music video hit number one on CMT's Top 20 Countdown on September 13, 2007. At the 2008 CMT Music Awards, the music video received nominations for three awards. It received a nomination for the Video of the Year, but lost to Taylor Swift's [...] "Our Song" [...] (2007) and for the Collaborative Video of the Year, but lost to Bon Jovi featuring LeAnn Rimes, [...] "Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore" [...] (2007). Roman White, who directed the music video, received a nomination for the Video Director of the Year, but lost to Michael Salomon.|$|E
500|$|In {{support of}} the US Marines on Hill 111 at 21:10 Wilton had ordered one company of the 1 DLI to occupy a reserve {{position}} on the left of 2 RAR, {{in the rear of}} the US 1st Marine Division where they ultimately remained for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> A reserve company from 3 RAR was also embussed in order to be ready to respond to any emergency. The Americans eventually drove off the Chinese probes after their artillery broke up the attack, but not before they were forced to abandon some of their forward positions. With the attack likely only a diversionary effort, by 21:20 the bulk of the Chinese had begun to withdraw from Hill 111. Meanwhile, the fighting on Hill 119 continued. A heavy bombardment fell on the American positions at 21:00, followed by a second assault on Hill 119 by two Chinese companies which succeeded in penetrating the US Marine perimeter. Hand-to-hand combat developed across the forward trenches and in the ensuing fighting Company G was reduced to half-strength, while their ammunition began to run low. Under pressure, by midnight the Americans were forced back another [...] to the reverse slope. 3 RAR was subsequently left exposed, with the forward Chinese elements moving to within [...] of the battalion's A Echelon area. Almost surrounded, the position was at risk of becoming untenable. At 00:15 Company I, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines was ordered to reinforce Boulder City; they lost heavily after the Chinese intercepted a coded message and adjusted mortar and artillery fire onto the Marines as they approached the rear of Hill 119. In response the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment launched an intense counter-battery barrage.|$|E

The only second course offered was toasted cheese. After dinner, the tablecloth was removed, the cook collected the money, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> was given up to noisy revelry.|$|E

2500|$|Mousquetaire gloves have buttons at {{the wrist}} so the wearer {{could open the}} buttons and slip her hand out without taking the whole glove off. The finger section would be folded in and kept away tidily. This is how ladies wore gloves while dining. After the meal they would put their hands back into the gloves, usually for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> During the 19th century, {{especially}} from the mid-Victorian era onwards, gloves were tailored so as to fit very tightly onto the hands and armsso tightly, in fact, that it was often necessary to use aids such as talcum powder and buttonhooks to put on one's gloves; therefore, it was considered somewhat uncouth to put on or remove one's gloves completely in public and women would make sure to don their gloves {{in the privacy of}} their homes before going out to some event (another reason for the popularity of the mousquetaire opening). The mousquetaire opening/fastening for women's long gloves seems to have become most popular during the Victorian era; during the Napoleonic/Regency period, women's long gloves were often tailored to fit loosely on the wearer's arm, and were often worn gathered below the elbow or held up on the biceps with a garter-like strap. (In the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice, Rosamund Pike and several other actresses wear opera-length gloves with drawstring ties at the top of the glove, but this might not be an accurate representation of the style of long gloves in the Regency era; fashion plates from the period do not appear to show gloves with drawstring-type ties, but do often show women wearing gloves held up by garterlike straps or ribbons.) ...|$|E
