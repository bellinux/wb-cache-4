5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance of}} getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with London's Evening Standard in January 2013, Anthony Hopkins (who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock) questioned The Girls portrayal of the director {{and the need for}} a film about that period of Hitchcock's career: [...] "I talked to Tippi Hedren one day...and she never mentioned that...Whatever his obsession was, she didn't want to dwell on it...I don't think it's necessary to put all <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> movie." [...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal {{of a man who was}} a little more complex than that. A lot of people, who were there, do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{responded to}} the PTC's {{criticism}} on Twitter, and said that parents should not expect her to parent their children and that [...] "touchy subject matters" [...] should not be hidden from children otherwise they will not learn how to adapt in society, and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape. The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive. And we decided to hone in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address, especially if you've been victimized in this scenario." [...] Rihanna added that the character is remorseful for her actions.|$|E
500|$|The story arc {{involving}} Bond's {{treatment of}} Sévérine {{has been widely}} criticized by media commentators. Bustle's Casey Cipriani criticized Bond's seduction of Sévérine after learning about her past sexual abuse as a child, and his response to her death. Cipriani cited the representation of Sévérine in the film {{as an example of}} the sexism prevalent throughout the franchise. Echoing Cipriani's sentiment, Jeff Bercovici of Forbes found the sequences of Bond having sex with Sévérine, and the character's death, irresponsible portrayals of sexual trafficking and violence, noting it is consistent with the [...] "exual hyper-aggressiveness and putting women in harm's way" [...] often seen in the films. National Sexual Violence Resource Center director Tracy Cox wrote that the film contributed to the false idea of [...] "victims of sexual violence [...] sexually available," [...] and felt that Bond [...] "abus his power and authority". The Friskys Julie Gerstein argued that Bond's expectation that Sévérine would have sex with him in return for freeing her is a form of [...] "transaction" [...] that places her as a prisoner of both Bond and Silva. Psychoanalyst Heather Genoves also responded negatively to the sex scene writing that it was [...] "rather tacky to then put <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sex-trafficking narrative". On the other hand, The Atlantics Noah Berlatsky found the conversation between Sévérine and Bond about her past as a sex slave to be [...] "the most realized sequence of the movie," [...] and praised the performances of both actors. However, Berlatsky was critical of Bond's subsequent seduction of the character.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, game {{designer}} Josh Millard released Ennuigi. Ennuigi adds metafictional commentary to {{the original}} game since it relates the story of Luigi's inability {{to come to terms}} with the lack of narrative. In a Reddit thread, Millard commented [...] "I [...] think it's a pretty weird implied narrative once you step back and look at it, and enjoyed funneling some thoughts about all <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> recharacterization of Luigi as a guy who's as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you'd expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise." ...|$|E

During the interview, he stated that he would begin recording his second major-label studio album in January 2014. Following the issue's release, TDE's CEO Anthony [...] "Top Dawg" [...] Tiffith pulled Kendrick Lamar from performing at GQs party that accompanies the issue, calling out writer Steve Marsh's profile, [...] "Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year," [...] for its [...] "racial overtones." [...] GQ editor-in-chief Jim Nelson responded with the following statement: [...] "Kendrick Lamar is one of the most talented new musicians to arrive on the scene in years. That's the reason we chose to celebrate him, wrote an incredibly positive article declaring him the next King of Rap, and gave him our highest honor: putting him on the cover of our Men of the Year issue. I'm not sure how you can spin <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bad thing, and I encourage anyone interested to read the story and see for themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cyberdreams {{brought in}} writer David Sears to {{collaborate}} with Harlan Ellison. Sears, formerly a writer and assistant editor for Compute! magazine, had never before worked on a video game. Though a long-time fan of Ellison and his work, Sears was initially nervous and somewhat skeptical at his assignment: [...] "...they said, 'No, it's I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, and I was like, 'What?'...At the time, in the game-development community, people said, 'Oh I love Ellison's stories, but there's no way you could turn <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> game.' I thought, 'Wow, what have I gotten into?'" [...] One of the biggest initial challenges was taking a short story whose characters have very limited background story and character development, and fleshing it out into a full-length interactive narrative. A breakthrough came about when Sears asked Ellison the question, [...] "Why were these people saved? Why did AM decide to save them?" [...] This brought about the decision to split the game into five separate narratives, each following a particular character and exploring why they had been selected to be tortured. Sears spent several weeks at Ellison's house, where they worked to flesh out the characters and their backgrounds.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning {{the central}} {{conflict}} of the film, Jackman {{found that he}} was in [...] "constant danger of tipping it too much" [...] and pushing the audience to one side or the other, so he composed a new main theme for the film to represent that Civil War, which he called [...] "a generic theme to balance everything out", and [...] "a narrative theme toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes." [...] The second major theme in the film is a thriller theme, that appears whenever the central mystery surrounding several character's pasts and Zemo's plan is teased or explored. It consists of a flute motif tied to the Winter Soldier's Russian handlers and a rising adagio that represents Zemo's twisted determination, and was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith. Of the character themes from previous films that Jackman did use, [...] "where appropriate", he evolved them to fit the tone and style of the new score. Captain America's theme could not be too prominent or heroic, as that would suggest that he was the hero of the film when the Russos were trying to create an ambiguity surrounding the main conflict—this does change throughout the film though, becoming more heroic when Captain America [...] "turns out to be right all along". For the Winter Soldier, Jackman took a [...] "rising string rhyme" [...] that was buried underneath [...] "the chaos and the industrial stuff" [...] in the end of the character's suite from The Winter Soldier, and developed <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> much more symphonic theme for the character, in keeping with his much more human portrayal in this film.|$|E
