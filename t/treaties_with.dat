25|$|More {{bilateral}} <b>treaties</b> followed, <b>with</b> the German Democratic Republic (effective November 21, 1973), with Poland (October 4, 1974), {{and with}} Czechoslovakia (March 18, 1975). The 1967 <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Hungary {{had already been}} prolonged in 1971 and was again renewed in 1977, the <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Bulgaria was renewed in 1975. In 1981, the first bilateral <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> a Western country was signed: the copyright <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Austria entered in force on December 16, 1981. On May 30, 1985, a <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Cuba followed, and in 1986 the second <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> a Western country was concluded with Sweden. All these post-UCC treaties went beyond {{the provisions of the}} UCC because they were applied retroactively and explicitly applied also to works published before the USSR had joined the UCC and that were still copyrighted in their source country in 1973. (The <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Austria was amended to cover such pre-1973 works in 1989.) On April 19, 1989, another copyright <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> Madagascar was concluded. The <b>treaty</b> <b>with</b> the German Democratic Republic was rescinded by the USSR on June 2, 1991, following confusions about its continued applicability after the German reunification.|$|R

5|$|After being {{appointed}} {{governor of}} the newly formed Indiana Territory in 1800, William Henry Harrison sought to secure title to Native American lands to open more land for settlers; in particular, he hoped the Indiana Territory would attract enough settlers to qualify for statehood. Harrison negotiated numerous land cession <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> American Indians, including the Treaty of Fort Wayne on September 30, 1809, in which Miami, Pottawatomie, Lenape, and other tribal leaders sold 3,000,000acres (approximately 12,000km²) to the United States.|$|E
5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led to {{the decline of the}} Overhill towns. The Cherokee were forced to cede most of their lands in this area through a series of unfavorable <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> the United States, and they migrated to the south and west away from settler pressure for a time.|$|E
5|$|Through 26 {{separate}} <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> the United States federal government, Native American {{tribes in}} Nebraska gradually ceded the lands currently comprising the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska. Logan Fontenelle, an interpreter for the Omaha and signatory to the 1854 treaty, played {{an essential role}} in those proceedings.|$|E

5|$|Tibet {{was once}} a strong power {{contemporaneous}} with Tang China (618–907). Until the Tibetan Empire's collapse in the 9th century, it was the Tang's major rival in dominating Inner Asia.

5|$|Upon {{independence}} from Portugal, the immediate focus of Brazil's foreign policy was to gain widespread international recognition. The first nation to recognize Brazilian sovereignty was the United States, in May 1825. Other nations followed in establishing diplomatic relations {{over the next}} few years. Portugal recognized the separation in August 1825. The Brazilian government subsequently made it a priority to establish its international borders through <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> its neighbors. The task of securing recognized frontiers was complicated by the fact that, between 1777 and 1801, Portugal and Spain had annulled their previous treaties setting out the borders between their American colonial empires. However, the Empire was able to sign several bilateral <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> neighbors, including Uruguay (in 1851), Peru (in 1851 and 1874), the Republic of New Granada (later Colombia, in 1853), Venezuela (in 1859), Bolivia (in 1867) and Paraguay (in 1872). By 1889, most of its borders were firmly established. The remaining issues—including the purchase of the region of Acre from Bolivia which would give Brazil its present-day configuration—were only finally resolved after the country became a republic.|$|E
5|$|Although McKinley enjoyed {{meeting the}} public, Cortelyou was {{concerned}} with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.|$|E

5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> the federal {{government}} that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E
5|$|Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a {{significant}} political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral {{rights and the}} associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, and not the British crown, had signed the <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> African kings that surrendered mining rights, but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory {{had a right to}} the royalties, and petitioned the governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed.

Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E

5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> the Indians.|$|E
5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knox–Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. <b>Treaties</b> <b>with</b> Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In early 1861 after Texas {{voted to}} secede from the United States and join the Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter began {{recruiting}} men for a new military company.

One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross {{set out for the}} Indian Territory. Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} before Cleveland's 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four million acres of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white {{settlement}} by executive order. Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them. Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory. Cleveland sent in eighteen companies of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan, at the time Commanding General of the U. S. Army, to investigate the matter.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace <b>treaties</b> <b>with</b> Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
