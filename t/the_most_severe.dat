5|$|Prior to Cyclone Magda's arrival, several {{severe weather}} {{warnings}} were issued for the coastline of Western Australia. Although the storm made landfall with winds of 130km/h (80mph), damage was limited {{due to the}} sparsely populated region it struck. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> damage was defoliation around Kuri Bay. Following its usage, the name Magda was retired and replaced with Megan.|$|E

Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E

For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold.
