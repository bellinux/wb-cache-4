2500|$|Merda is {{the basic}} Latin word for excrement. Frequently used, it appears {{in most of the}} Romance languages. Excreta, {{literally}} [...] "things expelled", referred most frequently to feces but could describe any bodily excretion. In its modern <b>technical</b> <b>use,</b> excreta is generally used to encompass fecal matter and urine.|$|E
2500|$|The term means [...] "rotation of duties", {{and first}} {{appears in the}} Tactica of Leo VI the Wise in the early 10th century for a generic body of troops. In a more <b>technical</b> <b>use</b> it came in use as an {{alternate}} term for a cavalry bandon, numbering between 50 and 400 men. In the 10th and 11th centuries, provincial allagia had some 50–150 men, while those of the central imperial army were closer to the upper limit, with circa 320–400 men.|$|E

2500|$|The {{industrial}} firm Auergesellschaft had {{a substantial}} amount of [...] "waste" [...] uranium from which it had extracted radium. After reading a June 1939 paper by Siegfried Flügge, on the <b>technical</b> <b>use</b> of nuclear energy from uranium, Nikolaus Riehl, the head of the scientific headquarters at Auergesellschaft, recognized a business opportunity for the company, and in July he went to the HWA (Heereswaffenamt, Army Ordnance Office) to discuss the production of uranium. The HWA was interested and Riehl committed corporate resources to the task. The HWA eventually provided an order for the production of uranium oxide, which took place in the Auergesellschaft plant in Oranienburg, north of Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Kirsopp Lake states [...] "copies {{of three}} and four columns" [...] is grammatically sound, but there appears not to be good {{evidence}} for this <b>technical</b> <b>use</b> of the words. [...] "Sending them by threes of fours" [...] is the most attractive, {{but there is no}} evidence that τρισσα can denote [...] "three at a time". Regarding [...] "in three or four columns per page," [...] there is only one known manuscript written in that way – Sinaiticus. Sinaiticus has a curious spelling of the word κραβαττος as κραβακτος; Sinaiticus spells Ισραηλειτης as Ισδραηλειτης, Vaticanus as Ιστραηλειτης; these forms have been regarded as Latin, and they can find in papyri from Egypt. There is no other known Greek district in which these forms were used. The argument for a Caesarean origin of these two manuscripts is much weaker than Egyptian.|$|E
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and <b>technical</b> <b>use</b> in all forms of English, common {{alternatives}} being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|E

A father of a family who kept no abbate {{for the education of}} his children ingeniously taught them himself. [...] "Father," [...] asked one of his children, [...] "what are the stars?" [...] "The stars are stars, and little things that shine as thou seest." [...] "Then they are candles, perhaps?" [...] "Make thy account that they are candles exactly." [...] "Of wax or tallow?"

6000|$|... 3. We {{are thus}} {{assisted}} by natural {{objects in the}} expression of particular meanings. But how great a language to convey such pepper-corn informations! Did it need such noble races of creatures, this profusion of forms, this host of orbs in heaven, to furnish man with the dictionary and grammar of his municipal speech? Whilst we use this grand cipher to expedite the affairs of our pot and kettle, {{we feel that we}} have not yet put it to its use, neither are able. We are like travellers using the cinders of a volcano to roast their eggs. Whilst we see that it always stands ready to clothe what we would say, we cannot avoid the question, whether the characters are not significant of themselves. Have mountains, and waves, and skies, no significance but what we consciously give them, when we employ them as emblems of our thoughts? The world is emblematic. Parts of speech are metaphors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind. The laws of moral nature answer to those of matter as face to face in a glass. [...] "The visible world and the relation of its parts, is the dial plate of the invisible." [...] The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics. Thus, [...] "the whole is greater than its part;" [...] "reaction is equal to action;" [...] "the smallest weight may be made to lift the greatest, the difference of weight being compensated by time;" [...] and many the like propositions, which have an ethical as well as physical sense. These propositions have a much more extensive and universal sense when applied to human life, than when confined to <b>technical</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
