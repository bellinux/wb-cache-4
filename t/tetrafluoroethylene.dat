25|$|Billions of {{kilograms}} of chlorodifluoromethane are produced annually as precursor to <b>tetrafluoroethylene,</b> the monomer that is converted into Teflon.|$|E
25|$|PFOA is also {{synthesized}} by the telomerization represented below, {{where the}} telogen is the organoiodine compound and the taxogen is the unsaturated <b>tetrafluoroethylene.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is {{conducted in the}} presence of a catalytic amount of mixed antimony halides. Chlorodifluoromethane is then converted into <b>tetrafluoroethylene,</b> the main precursor to Teflon. Before the Montreal Protocol, chlorodifluoromethane (designated as R-22) was also a popular refrigerant.|$|E
25|$|A {{fluoropolymer}} is a fluorocarbon based polymer {{with multiple}} strong carbon–fluorine bonds. It {{is characterized by}} a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. Fluoropolymers were discovered in 1938 by Dr. Roy Plunkett when he accidentally polymerized <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> to form polytetrafluoroethylene.|$|E
25|$|Co-polymerizing {{chlorotrifluoroethylene}} or <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> with {{vinyl ethers}} containing hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether produces fluorinated (FEVE) polyols. Two-component fluorinated polyurethanes prepared by reacting FEVE fluorinated polyols with polyisocyanate {{have been used}} to make ambient cure paints and coatings. Since fluorinated polyurethanes contain a high percentage of fluorine–carbon bonds, which are the strongest bonds among all chemical bonds, fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit resistance to UV, acids, alkali, salts, chemicals, solvents, weathering, corrosion, fungi and microbial attack. These have been used for high performance coatings and paints.|$|E
25|$|The {{product is}} {{oxidized}} by SO3 to form PFOA. Under reaction conditions, telomers form with varying length chains containing an even number of carbon atoms, as products mostly contain {{two to six}} <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> taxogens. After oxidation, distillation is used to separate PFOA from the other perfluorinated carboxylic acids. The telomerization synthesis of PFOA was pioneered by DuPont, {{and it is not}} well suited to the laboratory. PFOA formed by telomerization is completely linear, in contrast to the mixture of structures formed by ECF.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (Teflon) {{was discovered}} by accident by a recently hired DuPont PhD, Roy J. Plunkett. While working with a cylinder of <b>tetrafluoroethylene,</b> {{he was unable to}} release the gas, although the weight had not changed. Scraping down the container, he found white flakes of a polymer new to the world. Tests showed the substance was resistant to corrosion from most substances and had better high temperature stability than any other plastic. By early 1941, a crash program was making commercial quantities.|$|E

2500|$|Nafion is a {{sulfonated}} <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> based fluoropolymer-copolymer {{discovered in}} the late 1960s by Walther Grot of DuPont. It {{is the first of}} a class of synthetic polymers with ionic properties which are called ionomers. Nafion's unique ionic properties are a result of incorporating perfluorovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate groups onto a <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> (Teflon) backbone. [...] Nafion has received a considerable amount of attention as a proton conductor for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of its excellent thermal and mechanical stability.|$|E
2500|$|A special but {{significant}} {{application of the}} fluorinated building block approach is the synthesis of <b>tetrafluoroethylene,</b> which is produced on a large-scale industrially via the intermediacy of difluorocarbene.

2500|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a {{synthetic}} fluoropolymer of <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> that has numerous applications. The best known brand name of PTFE-based formulas is Teflon by Chemours. Chemours is a [...] 2015 spin-off of DuPont Co., which discovered the compound in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Because <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> can explosively {{decompose}} to tetrafluoromethane and carbon, special apparatus {{is required for}} the polymerization to prevent hot spots that might initiate this dangerous side reaction. [...] The process is typically initiated with persulfate, which homolyzes to generate sulfate radicals: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{indicated}} {{throughout this}} article, fluorine-substituents lead to reactivity that differs strongly from classical organic chemistry. [...] The premier example is difluorocarbene, CF2, {{which is a}} singlet whereas carbene (CH2) has a triplet ground state. [...] This difference is significant because difluorocarbene is a precursor to <b>tetrafluoroethylene.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Nafion {{derivatives}} {{are first}} synthesized by the copolymerization of <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> (TFE) (the monomer in Teflon) and a derivative of a perfluoro (alkyl vinyl ether) with sulfonyl acid fluoride. [...] The latter reagent {{can be prepared}} by the pyrolysis of its respective oxide or carboxylic acid to give the olefinated structure.|$|E
2500|$|As a salt, its {{dominant}} use is as an emulsifier for the {{emulsion polymerization}} of fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, or Teflon), polyvinylidene fluoride, and fluoroelastomers. For this use, 3M subsidiary Dyneon has a replacement emulsifer despite DuPont stating PFOA is an [...] "essential processing aid". PFOA {{is used in}} the production of Gore-Tex as it is PTFE-based. In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent. PFOA also finds uses in electronic products and as an industrial fluorosurfactant.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{an upgrade}} to Newport station was started {{to enable the}} station {{to cope with the}} {{expected}} passenger traffic associated with the 2010 Ryder Cup. A new passenger bridge and two new terminal buildings were constructed, with each platform being served by a lift. The new bridge is clad in ethylene <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE), the material which protects the Eden Project in Cornwall, despite which the roof initially gave problems with leaking. [...] The new development at the station includes a new multi-story car park and a new bus station will be developed outside, replacing the existing Newport bus station. The new north and south concourses opened on 13 September 2010. The development was criticised by Rail Magazine columnist Barry Doe for being at the wrong end of the station, having a leaking roof, a lack of seating and generally poor design.|$|E
2500|$|PTFE was accidentally {{discovered}} in 1938 by Roy Plunkett {{while he was}} working in New Jersey for DuPont. As Plunkett attempted {{to make a new}} chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, the <b>tetrafluoroethylene</b> gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling [...] "empty." [...] Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart. He found the bottle's interior coated with a waxy white material that was oddly slippery. Analysis showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure. Kinetic Chemicals patented the new fluorinated plastic (analogous to the already known polyethylene) in 1941, and registered the Teflon trademark in 1945.|$|E
