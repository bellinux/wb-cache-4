5|$|Tunbridge Wells local {{elections}} show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party dominance, {{apart from a}} <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> from 1994 to 1996 of no overall control and a <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> from 1996 to 1998 when the Liberal Democrats held a majority. The most recent elections, held in May 2008, gave the Conservatives a large majority with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats' four. The extent of the Conservatives' dominance is further illustrated {{by the fact that}} in some wards (e.g. Park) Labour did not even field a candidate in the 2008 council elections.|$|E

5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 {{calendar}} he {{won gold}} at the Summer Olympics {{in the individual}} time trial event and the Milan–San Remo. The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. In 2010, he won the Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories, while the latter was hampered by injuries throughout. After a lackluster <b>two-year</b> <b>period,</b> Cancellara again won the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix double in 2013. In 2014, Cancellara repeated as winner of the Tour of Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Lautner was {{initially}} {{supposed to be}} in two films, Northern Lights and a movie based on Max Steel, but pulled out of both films due to scheduling conflicts and better offers. Other planned projects were the lead in a movie about Stretch Armstrong and a hostage thriller, Cancun. Lautner filmed a Bourne Identity-esque spy film with Lily Collins, entitled Abduction. It was released in September 2011 to universally negative reviews from critics and Lautner's performance was heavily criticised. He appeared in the remaining parts of the Twilight series, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn films, which were released over a <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> from 2011–2012.|$|E

5|$|Loveless is {{the second}} studio album by Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine, {{released}} on 4 November 1991 by Creation Records. The album was recorded over a <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with texturised guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and {{a larger number of}} engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000.|$|E
5|$|One of the governor's most {{important}} political powers {{is the ability}} to call a special session of the General Assembly. During a <b>two-year</b> <b>period,</b> the assembly can meet on its own for no more than 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him or her in exchange for a special legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Qubilah {{accepted}} a plea agreement {{with respect to}} the charges, in which she maintained her innocence but accepted responsibility for her actions. Under the terms of the agreement, she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse for a <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> in order to avoid a prison sentence. For the duration of her treatment, Qubilah's ten-year-old son, Malcolm, was sent to live with Shabazz at her apartment in Yonkers, New York.|$|E

However, {{four years after}} the production of Casino Royale, CBS invited Fleming to write 32 episodes over a <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> for a television show based on the James Bond character. Fleming agreed and began to write outlines for this series. When nothing ever came of this, however, Fleming grouped and adapted three of the outlines into short stories and released the 1960 anthology For Your Eyes Only along with an additional two new short stories.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Eno's {{previous}} albums, {{which were}} recorded {{in a very short}} time, Before and After Science was two years in the making. During this <b>two-year</b> <b>period,</b> Eno was busy working on his solo ambient music albums Music for Films and Discreet Music. Due to the very positive critical reception accorded his previous rock music-oriented album Another Green World, Eno was afraid of repeating himself but still wanted to release a high-quality product.|$|E
5|$|During that time, Shapiro {{instructed}} ex-captive orangutans in {{the acquisition}} {{and use of}} signs following the techniques of psychologists R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner, who taught the chimpanzee, Washoe, in the late 1960s. In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{and during}} Israel's 1982 {{invasion}} of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both {{civilian and military}} targets. He prepared Beirut's defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon {{with the rest of}} the Fatah leadership. He settled in Amman for a <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis, by Israeli commandos.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualification}} process can start {{as early as}} almost three years before the final tournament and last over a <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, {{the winner of the}} Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup. From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.|$|E
5|$|In Italian service, Beograd and Ljubljana were repaired, re-armed, and renamed Sebenico and Lubiana respectively. Sebenico was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Italian Navy in August 1941, and Lubiana in October or November 1942. They both served mainly as convoy escorts between Italy and the Aegean and North Africa, with Sebenico completing more than 100 convoy escort missions over a <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> Neither ship {{was involved in}} any notable action. On 1 April 1943, Lubiana was either sunk off the Tunisian coast by British aircraft, or ran aground in the Gulf of Tunis and was lost. Sebenico was captured by the Germans in Venice after the Italian Armistice in September 1943 in a damaged condition. She was repaired, re-armed, and renamed TA43 and entered service in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy). TA43 served on escort and mine-laying duties in the northern Adriatic Sea, but saw little action. She was either damaged by artillery fire on 30 April 1945 at Trieste then scuttled, or just scuttled on 1 May.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} method for estimating the endemic status of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle in England and Wales has been developed. 6. 25 km 2 hexagonal cells {{were used as}} the base resolution. Maps were produced for overlapping <b>two-year</b> <b>periods</b> spanning 2001 / 03 to 2009 / 11. Distance from a farm to the ten nearest ‘Officially Tuberculosis Free status – Withdrawn’ incidents within {{the same time period}} was measured. Endemic areas were defined as those hexagons containing farms where the 3 rd nearest incident occurred within 7 km. Temporal spread of endemic bTB was estimated by creating a contour map displaying the spread of endemic bTB over the <b>two-year</b> <b>periods,</b> and using boundary displacement to calculate the rate of spread across each hexagon. A rate was obtained for ∼ 2300 cells and varied between 0. 04 km and 15. 9 km per year (median = 3. 3 km per year). This work will enable further analysis of the factors associated with this expansion...|$|R

5|$|NGC 2770 {{is a type}} SASc {{spiral galaxy}} located about 88 million light–years away that has hosted Type Ib {{supernova}}e: SN 1999eh, SN 2007uy, and SN 2008D. The last of these is famous for being the first supernova detected by the X-rays released very early on in its formation, {{rather than by the}} optical light emitted during later stages, which allowed the first moments of the outburst to be observed. It is possible that NGC 2770's interactions with a suspected companion galaxy may have created the massive stars causing this activity. UGC 4904 is a galaxy located about 77 million light-years from Earth. On 20 October 2004, a supernova impostor was observed by Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki within the galaxy. Observations of its spectrum suggest that it shed massive amounts of material in a <b>two-year</b> <b>period,</b> transforming from a LBV star to a Wolf–Rayet star, before it was observed erupting as hypernova SN 2006jc on October 11, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Other media {{based on}} the game has been published. A music album with the game's soundtrack, titled Ever 17: The Out of Infinity - Sound Collection, was {{released}} by Scitron on September 4, 2002. Scitron released another album, Ever 17: The Out of Infinity - Vocal Collection, on August 6, 2003, which collects singles previously released during a <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> The album includes two vocal tracks from the game, instrumental versions of them, and songs {{based on the}} events and characters of the game. A drama CD titled 2035 was released on December 18, 2002, also by Scitron. A manga adaptation of the game was drawn by Chigusa Umetani and released by Enterbrain on their Famitsu Comic Clear website from 2011 to 2012; it has since been collected in two volumes. A book, titled Ever 17 10th Anniversary Fanbook, was released at 2012's winter edition of Comiket, and included new art by Takigawa.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E
