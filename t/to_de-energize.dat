50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit <b>to</b> <b>de-energize</b> the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

The slide fence consists of a series of fence sections, as shown in the SLIDE FENCE DETAIL drawing (pictured right), which shows a typical installation. Each fence section is held in place by strong springs. At each end of a fence section is an electro-mechanical plug. The plugs maintain a complete electrical circuit that is monitored by signaling equipment. In normal operation, the current through the plugs causes a relay to energize, indicating that the fence is in place. When a rock slide occurs, the fence moves laterally, causing the plug to be removed, breaking the circuit. This causes the relay <b>to</b> become <b>de-energized,</b> indicating that a rock slide has occurred.

40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{requires}} iron {{for survival}} and establishment of {{infection in the}} human host. Pathogenic Neisseriae have evolved a repertoire of high-affinity iron acquisition systems to facilitate iron uptake in the human host. This requires specific outer membrane receptors and energy-harnessing cytoplasmic membrane proteins. The transferrin receptor proteins of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are necessary for iron uptake from transferrin in the host. The iron uptake system consists of two transferrin binding proteins, (Tbp) A and B. TbpA is an integral outer membrane, TonB-dependent transporter that forms the pore for iron internalization. TbpB is a surface exposed lipoprotein that makes the iron internalization process more efficient. TbpA is proposed to consist of two distinct domains: a β barrel and an N-terminal plug domain. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the EIEYE sequence in the TbpA plug domain plays an important role in iron internalization. We undertook a collaborative project to test the hypothesis that the conserved EIEYE sequence in the wild-type TbpA plug binds Fe 3 + during the outer membrane iron transport process. CD spectra analysis and fluorescence emission titration spectra of purified recombinant wildtype and mutated plug proteins revealed that Fe 3 + is sequestered by the wildtype TbpA plug protein, unlike the mutated plug protein. Modeling data with the wild-type plug predicts the EIEYE sequence is part of a flexible loop structure and acts as an Fe 3 + binding site. Characterization of the Tbps constituting the gonococcal receptor is important to understanding how the gonococcus survives within its host. TbpA and TbpB act together to acquire iron from human transferrin. We hypothesize that the presence of TbpA impacts the exposure or conformation of TbpB. In this study, we have utilized photoactivable cross-linkers to assess the effect of TbpA on TbpB in live gonococcal cells and studied it in presence of ligand and TonB derived energy. We employed insertion mutants, in which TbpA and TbpB contained the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, to probe for impact of TbpA on TbpB. Our results demonstrate that photo-cross-linking altered TbpB size and migration and was dependent on the presence of TbpA. HA epitope insertion mutants in surface exposed loops of TbpA and TbpB did not impact the mobility of cross-linked TbpB. Addition of human transferrin <b>to</b> the <b>de-energized</b> mutant caused a change in TbpB migration after cross-linking. This result indicates that when ligand is bound tightly and irreversibly <b>to</b> <b>de-energized</b> TbpA, the surface accessibility and perhaps conformation of TbpB is altered and TbpA does not interact with TbpB. Our findings were confirmed with recent structural studies of TbpA-TbpB-ligand triple complex, which illustrate that Tbps bind ligand through unique, non-overlapping binding sites such that TbpA and TbpB do not interact. TbpB is not an essential member of transferrin-iron acquisition pathway. It is surface exposed and tethered to the outer membrane by a lipid moiety. The role of TbpB has not been clearly outlined in the transferrin iron acquisition system. The last objective of this study was to look at the significance of two specific conserved regions of TbpB and its importance in transferrin iron utilization and TbpA-TbpB interaction. Using site-directed mutagenesis we created two mutants, in the first mutant the conserved lipobox of TbpB was replaced with a signal I peptidase cleavage site, and the second mutant contained a deletion of the conserved poly glycine residue stretch, immediately downstream of the lipobox. Our results indicate that lipobox is required for lipidation of TbpB, both the mutants were impaired for transferrin-iron utilization, and neither of the mutations altered TbpA-TbpB interaction. Overall, these studies help elucidate the functional importance of the specific regions in TbpA and TbpB in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, thereby adding to our understanding of the process of iron acquisition through the transferrin binding proteins...|$|R

40|$|Ground faults in {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems pose a {{fire and}} shock hazard. To mitigate these risks, AC-isolated, DC grounded PV systems in the United States use Ground Fault Protection Devices (GFPDs), e. g., fuses, <b>to</b> <b>de-energize</b> the PV system {{when there is a}} ground fault. Recently the effectiveness of these protection devices has come under question because multiple fires have started when ground faults went undetected. In order to understand the limitations of fuse-based ground fault protection in PV systems, analytical and numerical simulations of different ground faults were performed. The numerical simulations were conducted with Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) using a circuit model of the PV system which included the modules, wiring, switchgear, grounded or ungrounded components, and the inverter. The derivation of the SPICE model and the results of parametric fault current studies are provided with varying array topologies, fuse sizes, and fault impedances. Closed-form analytical approximations for GFPD currents from faults to the grounded current carrying conductor-known as %E 2 % 80 % 9 Cblind spot%E 2 % 80 % 9 D ground faults-are derived to provide greater understanding of the influence of array impedances on fault currents. The behavior of the array during various ground faults is studied for a range of ground fault fuse sizes to determine if reducing the size of the fuse improves ground fault detection sensitivity. The results of the simulations show that reducing the amperage rating of the protective fuse does increase fault current detection sensitivity without increasing the likelihood of nuisance trips to a degree. Unfortunately, this benefit reaches a limit as fuses become smaller and their internal resistance increases to the point of becoming a major element in the fault current circuit...|$|E

The findings of that study are detailed in this paper, and serve to characterize the circumstances surrounding electrical injuries and identify causal factors. The study included three tasks: 1) a direct review of mining industry occupational injury data compiled by MSHA, 2) interpretation of the narrative descriptions available for the injuries (from MSHA data) and 3) a separate examination of fatal electrical injuries. Eight-hundred sixty-five electrical injuries were reported during the 10 -year period studied, with 39 of those being fatalities. This makes electrical injuries disproportionately fatal with respect to most other types of injuries in mining. Electrical injury rates were higher in coal mining than noncoal mining and, within the coal sector, rates were higher in underground operations than in surface operations. Of the 865 total cases, electrical and machine maintenance or repair activities were involved in 580 (69 %), and electricians and mechanics were injured in 362 cases (42 %). Of the 39 fatal electrical injuries, 27 (69 %) involved electrical maintenance or repair work, and in 21 of these 27 cases, the failure <b>to</b> <b>de-energize,</b> lock-out and tag the circuit was the cause or a contributing factor.

The proposed concept can pose major operational problems for a large MTDC network and connected AC systems as the large ‘loss of infeed’ may cause large excursion in AC frequency. Thus, fast and reliable protection is mandatory for fast fault clearance to avoid complete shutdown of the entire network so as to minimize the disturbances to the connected AC networks. Some MMC topologies [15 – 17] can block or control DC fault current but resulting additional capital cost and power loss.

PurposeIn this article, an attempt {{has been made}} to determine if patterns can be identified to categorize maintenance and repair fatalities in mining, to compare occurrence of fatalities between coal and metal/nonmetal sectors, and to use this information to identify safety deficiencies and associated proposed remedial measures. MethodsA classification scheme was developed to identify patterns in fatalities, including proximal causes, tasks, and contributing factors. This scheme was tested to ensure adequacy of the categories, and fatalities were categorized using the scheme. All testing and categorization were done by two of the authors to ensure reliability of the coding scheme. ResultsPatterns were successfully identified to categorize the fatalities, and these patterns were different between coal and metal/nonmetal mines. Coal mines had a greater proportion of electrical-related fatalities, while more fatalities related to potential energy occurred at metal/nonmetal mines. Most of the fatalities were caused by the victim coming into contact with an object or machine or the victim falling from height, and they occurred most often while the victim was performing maintenance or repair on equipment, cleaning, or removing blockages. The most frequent factors contributing to these incidents were failure <b>to</b> properly <b>de-energize</b> or lock out/tag out equipment, violation of work procedures, missing or inadequate safety equipment, and failure to block equipment properly. ConclusionsThe classification approach used was successful in identifying hazard patterns during maintenance and repair fatalities in mining. These patterns identify areas to focus attention when developing interventions to prevent the occurrence of future fatalities.

40|$|This {{research}} work is mainly concerned {{about dealing with}} temporary short circuit faults in power system transmission lines. In fact, {{there are two types}} of electrical faults in power systems, namely temporary and permanent. When a fault is permanent, the only way to clear it is <b>to</b> <b>de-energize</b> the transmission line by opening the associated circuit breakers. However, in many cases the fault is not solid and is caused by objects such as flying birds or broken branches of trees. For these cases, electrical arc plays a major role. For such fault cases, it is also possible <b>to</b> <b>de-energize</b> the faulted phase, temporarily, and re-energize it after a short delay by reclosing the opened circuit breakers. This operation is called single-phase reclosing. There is a chance that the fault becomes clear by natural extinction of the arc after the faulted phase isolation in case the fault is temporary. There are two considerable challenges regarding traditional single-phase reclosing in transmission lines. The first challenge is the determination of the fault type, i. e., permanent or temporary, as there is no guarantee that the fault is temporary. This is crucially important as reclosing-on-fault, i. e., reclosing the opened breakers while the fault still stands, is harmful for both power system stability and power system equipment. The second challenge which is regarding temporary faults only, is that there is still no guarantee that the arc is extinguished by the moment of reclosing. In such cases, reclosing leads in re-striking of arc and therefore, an unsuccessful reclosing. This {{research work}} is conducted in two phases. At the first phase, two adaptive methods are developed to improve the traditional reclosing method upon the two challenges mentioned in the second paragraph. The developed methods are capable of recognition of the fault type in a reasonable amount of time after single-phase isolation of the line. Therefore, the protection system will be able to block the reclosing function in case the fault is recognized as permanent and to issue three-phase-trip signal as the next action. For temporary faults, re-energizing of the isolated phase by reclosing the opened breakers is the next action which has to be performed after the arc extinction. The developed methods also have the capability of detection of the arc extinction and therefore, a better performance for temporary fault cases is guaranteed. This is the second feature required for an adaptive reclosing method. The second phase of the research project is to estimate the arc extinction time well in advance in case the fault is temporary. The idea is that three-phase tripping could be the right action if the arc extinction time is too long as working under unbalanced conditions for an unnecessarily long time duration is harmful for the power system. Both of the proposed adaptive single-phase reclosing methods in this research work employ local voltage information. Therefore, communication facilities are not needed for implementation of the proposed methods. It is shown in the thesis that the proposed methods are able to quickly detect the fault type and also the arc extinction if the fault is temporary. Also, the two proposed arc extinction time prediction methods are capable of prediction of the arc extinction time well in advance and with acceptable precision. All four proposed methods are effective for various system configurations including ideally-transposed, untransposed and partially-transposed transmission lines and also for transmission lines with different compensation conditions including with and without shunt reactor. Superior performance of the proposed methods have been verified using 550 case studies simulated in PSCAD and Matlab, and also a field recorded temporary fault case associated with a 765 kV transmission line. The 550 simulated case studies include 100 ideally-transposed, 240 untransposed and 210 partially-transposed line cases. The performances of the two proposed reclosing methods are also compared with two of the existing adaptive reclosing methods where considerable improvements are observed...|$|E
40|$|The US Coast Guard {{approached}} NIOSH {{about an}} increase in the number of winch entanglement injuries being reported among commercial shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. In August of 2012, a 15 year-old boy, fishing on a shrimp boat, died when his clothing became caught in an operating deck winch. This fatality received widespread coverage within the industry and further highlighted the need for action. Using the NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID), researchers at the Alaska Pacific Office began studying the incidence of shrimp winch entanglements and found a total of 35 severe work-related injuries, including eight fatal injuries, caused by deck winches reported in the Southern shrimp fleet from 2000 - 2011. NIOSH has developed a prototype system that will allow a victim of a try-net winch entanglement to shut off electrical power via a bumper switch. Bumper switches mounted to the winch frame provide an alternate method to turn off the electric winch. The prototype auxiliary-stop circuit is not an emergency-stop device that will arrest the momentum of the drum, but an alternate device <b>to</b> <b>de-energize</b> the winch motor. NIOSH believes that the auxiliary-stop circuit control is a feasible and cost-effective interim safety measure until a more comprehensive retrofit that will immediately stop the drum can be implemented. NIOSH formed partnerships with boat owners from various cultural groups to collaborate with the auxiliary-stop testing. Three prototype systems were installed on the F/V Daytin and Destin of Dulac, LA, the F/V Lucky CJ of Port Arthur, TX and the F/V Miss Opal of Brownsville, TX. Feedback from the fishermen will be used to refine the prototype design to make it robust enough to reliably withstand the harsh fishing environment. Researchers and industry collaborators will also strive to make the auxiliary-stop circuit compatible with most electrical systems used on side-trawl shrimping vessels fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Upon the successful completion of the field-testing, NIOSH will seek partners to promote this system to shrimp fishermen. Through collaborations and partnerships with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested auxiliary-stop design plans will be made available to shrimpers via various internet websites. NIOSH plans to release the information in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese to better reach the target audience. NIOSHTIC No 2004721...|$|E
40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a manager at an electronic scrap (e-scrap) recycling company. The request concerned potential exposure to metals, including lead and cadmium. The company employed about 80 individuals who processed and recycled computers, monitors, hard drives, televisions, printers, light bulbs, and other e-scrap. We evaluated the facility in April and June 2013. We (1) interviewed employees about their work practices, symptoms, and health concerns related to work; (2) tested work surfaces, skin, and clothing for metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel, and mercury; and (3) tested employees' urine for cadmium and mercury and their blood for lead and cadmium. No employees reported work-related health problems. Exposure to lead was well controlled in the shred room as indicated by employee blood lead levels. However, two employees in the teardown area had elevated blood lead levels (at or above 10 25 g/dL). Blood and urine cadmium levels were not elevated, and no mercury was detected in employees' urine. We found lead and other metals on the skin of employees at lunch and before going home. We also found metals on nonproduction work surfaces. Lockers stored personal items and food along with work clothing and personal protective equipment. Showers and laundered uniforms were only offered to the glass shredding employees. Workers unjammed scrap from equipment that was powered on and running. To address employee exposures to metals, we recommended the employer (1) include all employees exposed to lead in a lead prevention program, (2) install a clean locker room area for employees to store personal items and food, (3) provide scrubs, uniforms, shoe covers, and a contract laundering service for all employees exposed to lead, (4) require all employees exposed to lead to shower and change clothing before leaving work, and (5) {{increase the number of}} sinks for hand washing. We also recommended the employer follow lockout/tagout procedures <b>to</b> <b>de-energize</b> machinery before conducting troubleshooting, repairs, or maintenance. We recommended employees take a shower {{at the end of the}} shift, wash their hands before eating or smoking, and not wear or take work clothing or shoes home.

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a computational model of mitochondrial energetics that includes Ca 2 +, proton, Na+, and phosphate dynamics. The model accounts for distinct respiratory fluxes from substrates of complex I and complex II, pH effects on equilibrium constants and enzyme kinetics, and the acid-base equilibrium distributions of energy intermediaries. We experimentally determined NADH and ΔΨm in guinea pig mitochondria during transitions from <b>de-energized</b> <b>to</b> energized, or during state 2 / 4 to state 3 respiration, or into hypoxia and uncoupling, and compared the results with those obtained in model simulations. The model quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed magnitude of ΔΨm, {{the range of}} NADH levels, respiratory fluxes, and respiratory control ratio upon transitions elicited by sequential additions of substrate and ADP. Simulation results are also able to mimic the change in ΔΨm upon addition of phosphate to state 4 mitochondria, leading to matrix acidification and ΔΨm polarization. The steady-state behavior of the integrated mitochondrial model qualitatively simulates the dependence of respiration on the proton motive force, and the expected flux-force relationships existing between respiratory and ATP synthesis fluxes versus redox and phosphorylation potentials. This upgraded mitochondrial model provides what we believe are new opportunities for simulating mitochondrial physiological behavior during dysfunctional states involving changes in pH and ion dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{cable tunnel}} is {{equipped}} with two temperature-controlled ventilation fans. Each fan has a capacity of 21, 000 cfm and is connected to a 480 v bus. One fan will start automatically when {{the temperature in the}} tunnel reaches 1 00 °F. Under the worst conditions, i. e., loss of outside power and all the Engineered Safety Features in operation, one ventilation fan is capable of maintaining the tunnel temperature below 1040 F. Under the same worst conditions, if no ventilation fans were operating, the natural air circulation through the tunnel would be sufficient to limit the gross tunnel temperature to below the tolerable value of 1401 F. However, in order to provide for ample tunnel ventilation capacity, the two ventilation fans are required to be operable when the reactor is made critical. If one ventilation fan is found inoperable, the other fan will ensure that cable tunnel ventilation is available. Valves 856 A, C, D and E are maintained in the open position during plant operation to assure a flow path for high-head safety injection during the injection phase of a loss-of-coolant accident. Valves 856 B and F are maintained in the closed position during plant operation to prevent hot-leg injection during the injection phase of a loss-of-coolant accident.

40|$|Background and objective: One of {{the main}} causes of {{bacterial}} resistance to antimicrobials is multidrug resistance induced by the increased efficiency of the efflux pumps. In this study we analyzed how the conditions of assay affect the efflux of indicator substrates ethidium (Et+) and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) in Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium cells. Impact of the outer membrane permeability barrier, composition and temperature of the medium on accumulation of the indicator compounds also was analyzed. Materials and methods: The fluorescence of Et+ and Nile Red was measured using 96 -well plates and a plate reader. In parallel to traditional studies of fluorescence we applied a constructed selective electrode to follow the accumulation of Et+ in S. enterica cells. Simultaneously with monitoring of Et+ concentration in the cell incubation medium, electrochemical measurements of TPP+ accumulation were performed. Furthermore, Et+ and TPP+ were used within the same sample as agents competing for the interaction with the efflux pumps. An inhibitor phenylalanyl-arginyl-β-naphtylamide (PAβN) was applied to evaluate the input of RND-family pumps in the total efflux of these indicator compounds. Results: S. enterica cells with the intact outer membrane (OM) bound very low amounts of Et+ or TPP+. Cells with the permeabilized OM accumulate considerably higher amounts of the indicator compounds at pH 8. 0, but only Et+ was considerably accumulated at pH 6. 5. At conditions of electrochemical monitoring accumulation of Et+ by the permeabilized cells at 37  °C was considerably faster than at 23  °C, but at the higher temperature most of the cell-accumulated Et+ was extruded back to the medium. The fluorescence of Et+ in suspension of cells incubated in 400  mmol/L Tris buffer was about twice higher compared to 100  mmol/L one. The inhibitory action of TPP+ on Et+ efflux was evident only in 400  mmol/L Tris although PAβN effectively increased Et+ fluorescence at both buffer concentrations. Conclusions: Results of our experiments indicate that ionic strength of the incubation medium influence the selectivity, the medium temperature and the assay conditions impact the kinetics of efflux. The lower accumulated amount and the weaker fluorescence of Et+ registered in slightly acidic medium indicate that ΔΨ {{plays a role in}} the accumulation of this indicator cation. The bound amount of Et+ <b>to</b> the <b>de-energized</b> or permeabilized cells considerably varies depending on the conditions and methods of de-energization or permeabilization of cells. Tris/EDTA permeabilization of the cells does not inhibit the efflux...|$|R
