50|$|Richard Cobden's {{construction}} in Manchester's Mosley Street {{was the first}} palazzo warehouse. There were already seven warehouses on Portland Street when they commenced building the elaborate Watts Warehouse of 1855, but four more were opened before it was finished. It was this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> that inspired the Germans in Düsseldorf and Munich to name their prestigious department stores Warenhäuser.|$|E
50|$|At Manchester Road Wharf on the {{southern}} side of the canal, there {{is a group of}} 3 warehouses each of a different age and style. On wharf I (SD8387 3228) there is an 1801 two-storey, stone warehouse of 7 by 3 bays. It was built parallel to the canal allowing direct unloading from the barges using catshead cranes. On wharf II (SD 8385 3235) there is a single-storey, open-fronted stone warehouse. This was built in the 1890s. The roof is supported by 4 rows of full-height cast-iron columns. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> remained a feature of dock architecture well into the 20th century. On wharf III at SD8383 3232 is a four-storey 1841 stone-built warehouse, that is parallel to the canal. The floors and the queen post truss roof are supported by cast-iron columns. On the road side there is a projecting three-storey loading bay.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the warehouse credit providing business is limiting fraud on warehouse lending. Main risks of fraud include dishonest and collusive mortgage loan originators, title companies, real estate agents and customers themselves, false information in the loan application (especially appraisals), forged signatures on the loan documents, and false documents of title. The 'Wet funding' <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> credit is riskier in terms of possible fraud because the credit provider will not be aware of any potential problems until after the funds are sent to the loan originator. Measures that the warehouse lender can take to limit fraud can be a strong screening process for mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies, making sure the loan originator itself has a strong internal screening process, limiting the amount available for 'wet funding', and having separate account for funds coming from sale of loans to investors.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{warehouses}} were {{a dominant}} {{part of the}} urban landscape {{from the start of}} the Industrial Revolution through the 19th century and into the twentieth century. The buildings remained when their original usage had changed. There are four identifiable <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouses.</b> The cotton industry rose with the development <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse,</b> and all five types were represented in Manchester in the United Kingdom. <b>Warehouses</b> <b>of</b> that period in Manchester were often lavishly decorated, but modern warehouses are more functional.|$|R

50|$|A canal {{warehouse}} is {{a commercial}} building principally {{associated with the}} expansions of canals from 1761 to 1896. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> derived from coastal predecessors, had unique features: it had internal water filled canal arms that entered the building, it was multistorey with canal access at one level and road and even rail egress at another, and has a hoist system powered by a water wheel or at later stages steam. Canal warehouses were transhipment warehouses, holding goods until they could be shipped out to their next recipient.The first true canal warehouse was the Dukes Warehouse, at the Bridgewater Canal Basin in Castlefield, Manchester built in 1761. It has been demolished, but two later warehouses at Castlefield have been restored. The later Portland Basin warehouse, was built in 1834 by the architect, David Bellhouse. It has three shipping arms, and continued {{to be used as}} a storage warehouse after its serving canal became disused.|$|E
50|$|In 1865, Cargill (now {{the largest}} privately held company in America) was first started in Conover when William Wallace Cargill left his {{family home in}} Janesville, Wisconsin, and {{purchased}} a grain flat house in Conover, Iowa. The flat house, a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> that preceded country elevators, {{was at the end}} of the McGregor & Western Railroad line. This was the first business in a long line of agriculture-based businesses that would build the huge Cargill empire. By 1866, the village boasted 1200-1500 inhabitants, many of whom had migrated from nearby Calmar. David Noggle presented a petition for incorporation of Conover into a town, and County Judge G. R. Wellett issued the order of incorporation on 17 October 1866. In 1867, Capt. V. C. Jacobs was elected the first (and only) mayor of Conover. Town Councilmen included Col. G. D. Pagent, Charles Sydan, and probably Capt. George Q. Gardner, but detailed town records were destroyed in a subsequent fire. The election expenses exceeded the capacity of the town treasury, and township clerk J. J. Haug took assignment of the accounts, but the expenses remained unpaid.|$|E
40|$|Computer Aided Planning {{systems can}} be {{expected}} to start playing {{a major role in the}} warehouse planning process. Each warehouse has to be planned scpecifically. The dimensions of a warehouse depend on several factors, including: - the stock - strategies - product mix - product handling characteristics, - <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouse,</b> etc. In order to find an optimal solution, many possible variations must be evaluated. The central problem for all subsequent planning steps is the optimiziation of the layout. The iterative planning process lends itself to the use of computers. The following paper presents a new computer-aided method for optimal dimensioning of warehouses. It is based upon the work at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing and Automation...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays <b>warehousing</b> {{became one}} <b>of</b> the most {{important}} and critical part in supply chain systems {{due to the fact that}} it consumes a considerable part of logistic cost. Designing phase <b>of</b> <b>warehousing</b> system is {{the most important}} part in <b>warehousing</b> since most <b>of</b> the strategic and tactical decisions should be taken in this phase. Majority of academic papers are primarily analysis oriented and does not give a systematic method and techniques as a basis for warehouse redesign. So there is a need to develop a structured procedure that can be applied for different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouses.</b> Therefore the purpose of this thesis is to develop a process for redesigning production warehouses, and analyzing major problems during redesign steps. The thesis is designed as a case study, and a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection and data analysis. The methodology focuses around the warehousing process and redesign steps as described in the literature. Results of the thesis develop a seven steps procedure for redesigning <b>of</b> the production <b>warehouse,</b> also different problems and challenges are faced during redesign steps. It was tried to choose the best redesigning method which fit with the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse,</b> in order to cover the space reduction <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse</b> with the consideration of existing facilities and reducing of cost. In addition, the performance <b>of</b> the current <b>warehouse</b> system was evaluated based on current design <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse</b> in order to avoid repeating of same mistake in redesign process. Storage assignment policy as one of the redesign steps was discussed and a framework for storage system of the components were suggested. The findings of the thesis to some extent can be applicable to other production warehouses. Further research is suggested for more specific results and new developed redesign methods for all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouses...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} four {{different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> warehousingtransportation vehicles (lifttrucks and stacker crane) are analyzed. The complexity <b>of</b> designing <b>warehousing</b> systems in an analytical way is hightherefore the discrete simulation models were performed {{in order to}} gain the basic data for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> warehousing-transportation vehicles. First, the counter balance lift truck is analyzed, which is useful for a lower rack warehouse construction and a lower frequency of operation. Next, the reach truck is analyzedit enables to achieve higher lifting places, with a relatively high frequency and lift capacity. The narrow aisle lift truck can reach heights up to twelve meters, and is suitable for high frequency demands and lift capacities. Finally, the automated storage and retrieval system is analyzed. The presented models prove to be a very useful and flexible tool for choosing a particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehousing</b> system on the first stage <b>of</b> designing the <b>warehouse</b> process...|$|R

40|$|Each {{enterprise}} contemplates {{the ways}} of saving. The warehouse {{is one of the}} tools that helps in optimizing company costs and that also forms {{an integral part of the}} transformation process at the same time. It allows one to bridge the mismatch between the transfer of goods and materials between a producer and a consumer. Selecting the correct <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> can affect not only the cost items, but it can also affect the delivery time of the required goods or materials which the end customer´s satisfaction depends upon. What is equally important is the role of a warehouse area location as it can affect the time required for a consignment delivery, which is also in conjunction with the right connections to the transport infrastructure. As certain analyses show, there are enough of the different types of storage facilities in various locations in Slovakia. Just such a tactical and strategic decision must take into account not only the location, the infrastructure connection or the provided services, but it must also include the financial aspects in order to achieve cost savings and the optimization of the costs. The aim of this paper is to define the current situation in the market with storage facilities in Slovakia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conceptual {{design for a}} new generation <b>of</b> automated <b>warehouses,</b> which are made from a series of simple modules with their inherent feature of scalability and reonfigurability.

Physical infrastructure and operational control events within the system are illustrated in the paper. The simulation results demonstrate that the warehouse can simultaneously deliver large numbers of items from storage modules to assigned collection points with minimal delay. This can be achieved by deploying an integrated warehouse control and management mechanism using automatic identification and data capture techniques and wireless communication networks. A framework on application of these emerging technologies in order to deliver the desired coordinated functionality <b>of</b> such a <b>warehousing</b> system is also discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>warehousing</b> system, Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems (RMFS).

There exist new decision problems in such systems, for example, the reallocation of pods after their visits at work stations or the selection of pods to fulfill orders. In order to analyze decision strategies for these decision problems and relations between them, we develop a simulation framework called "RAWSim-O" in this paper. Moreover, we show a real-world application of our simulation framework by integrating simple robot prototypes based on vacuum cleaning robots...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the proper}} storage {{locations}} for potentially thousands of products is one major task that faces the warehouse manager during the design <b>of</b> a new <b>warehouse</b> or the refurbishment of existing facility. There are many factors affects the storage assignment. For example, order picking method, {{size and layout}} of the storage system, material handling system, product characteristics, demand trends, turnover rates and space requirements. Selecting appropriate storage assignment policies (i. e. random, dedicated or class-based) and routing methods (i. e. transversal, return or combined) with regards to above factors is a possible solution to tackle this problem. However, the efficiency of these policies is interdependent.
