Umicore's copper extraction and refining operations were divested in 2005, with its zinc refining operations following in 2007; these now form part of Aurubis and Nyrstar respectively.|$|E

Since then travel to and from town is done almost exclusively by automobile.

Twice daily passenger bus service used to be provided by STC, the provincially owned bus line, until STC ceased operations in May 2017.|$|E
25|$|The outlay {{of money}} on {{equipment}} varies greatly. Some items commonly found on Christmas tree farms are insecticide sprayers, tractors, and shaper sheers. Mechanized planters, {{at a cost of}} about US$4,000, are not essential but a work-saving luxury for farmers. Farmers can purchase seedlings, <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> of a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000plants. The farmer, a wholesaler, sold his final products for about $20each; after the cost of the trees and other expenses, a profit of $2–3per tree.|$|E

In 2010, Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 2.3million or 14% {{of the adult population}} undertook voluntary work with the sport and recreation organisations, most likely to be sporting clubs. At the club level, volunteers include coaches, officials and administrators. Clubs generally receive their limited income from membership fees. Professional sporting clubs have been established to compete in national and international leagues such as Australian Football League, National Rugby League, A-League, ANZ Championship and Super 15.|$|E

The diversity of such habitats {{in such a}} concentrated area make it a natural magnet for all forms of wildlife.

They include brown bullhead, channel catfish, crappie, carp and small striped bass that utilize the wider expanses of Darby Creek, just before its confluence with the Delaware River, in the earlier stages of their development. The fields and meadows provide open areas where wide arrays of insects including several species of butterflies can be found foraging the dozens of species of wildflowers.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{both the}} Japanese and the Portuguese were {{left out of}} the {{tributary}} trade by {{the first decades of the}} 16th century. By the middle of the century though, Japan and Portugal became the premier suppliers of silver in East Asia by bringing in silver from mines like the Iwami Ginzan in Japan and the Cerro de Potosí in Bolivia. Silver was <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> of the Ming Chinese economy, but the Ming government placed many restrictions on mining due to fears that the bullion would pool into private hands. Even without the restrictions, China's silver veins were too small and located too far away in the southwest from the commercialized coastal provinces to keep up with the huge demand. This situation made unofficial dealings with foreigners very profitable and enticing for Chinese merchants, despite the risks and illegality of their trade.|$|E

25|$|Columbia {{received}} its first charter as {{a town in}} 1805. An intendant and six wardens would govern the town. John Taylor, the first elected intendant, later served {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually as governor. By 1816, there were 250 homes in the town and a population of more than one thousand. Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers. Cotton was <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> of the Columbia community; in 1850 virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton.|$|E

500|$|An avid {{student of}} the game, in the 1950 FIFA World Cup Matthews stayed on to watch teams such as Brazil and Uruguay compete in the tournament after England's {{elimination}} – the English FA, manager and media all returned home to, as Matthews said, [...] "bury their heads in the sand." [...] Matthews regularly condemned the [...] "blazer brigade" [...] at the FA in his autobiography, slating them as [...] "conservative" [...] and stressing {{that many of them}} were Old Etonians; in his view they treated players and supporters poorly, demonstrated arrogance by ignoring competitions they did not control (the World Cup and European domestic competitions), and viewed innovations with excessive suspicion (for example the FA sanctioned only the use of floodlights in 1952 despite artificial lighting having been experimented with as far back as 1878, and for years insisted on using outdated kit such as heavy [...] "reinforced" [...] boots). Writing {{about the fact that the}} FA allocated only 12,000 of the 100,000 available tickets for the 1953 FA Cup Final to Blackpool supporters, Matthews wrote: [...] "I couldn't make my mind up whether they were dunderheads or simply didn't care about the genuine supporters who were <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> of the game".|$|E

But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E
