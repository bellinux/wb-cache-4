50|$|New Deal was {{originally}} known as Monroe, named for Monroe G. Abernathy, a local landowner. The town {{was originally}} {{developed as a}} train station loading site.

Some time afterward the town wanted a post office and requested the permit for the Monroe Postal Station. Because there was already a town in Texas with the name Monroe City, the U.S. postal department changed the name of the town to New Deal after Franklin D. Roosevelt's programs and {{to go along with the}} consolidated school system's name. This information was all developed when the school system had to write a history when applying for a federal grant. In 1970, the township was incorporated by the vote of its citizens. The city of Lubbock, Texas, was planning some annexation of surrounding lands and the people of the New Deal area decided to incorporate rather than be annexed to the city of Lubbock. A local farmer, Billy Fortenberry, was the first mayor. In 1970, Ray Edell West, a city councilman for three years, became the mayor. Under his mayoral direction in the next 7 years, the town built a City Hall and a Volunteer Fire Department building.|$|E

The present study addresses <b>the</b> effect of <b>training</b> of Child Health Doctors (CHDs) in a structured method to identify psychosocial problems on the accuracy of this identification in children aged 5 - 6. Method: The study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a baseline and two follow-up measurements. A volunteer sample of 58 CHDs participated, randomly assigned to intervention or control condition. CHDs selected a population-based sample of 5 - 6 -year-old children (n = 6375). Results: The first follow-up showed that sensitivity had improved by 9 % and specificity by 5 % in the intervention condition, especially in children with severe problems (odds ratio = 3. 7; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 2 - 11. 8). The second follow-up showed a decrease in sensitivity and specificity in both conditions. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>training</b> improves <b>identification</b> of psychosocial problems, especially severe ones. although the availability of time and resources also influences the accuracy with which psychosocial {{problems are}} identified.

The performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence rate and minimum mean squared error indicate that the distributed DE algorithms exhibit superior performance compared to its PSO counter parts...|$|R
30|$|Previous work by {{our group}} {{led to the}} {{successful}} identification of the species of bacteria present in single-species biofilms that had been dehydrated before analysis (Beier et al. 2010).

Since only single-species biofilms {{were used in the}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>training</b> set, we chose this enhancement in signal levels over the preservation of structural information. Here, we apply this model to map species distributions within simple hydrated biofilms. Confirmation of the model’s successful transfer is performed using intact single-species biofilms. With the ability to identify the species within hydrated biofilms in situ, the model is used to perform species identifications of volumes within a two-species mixed biofilm.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a novel feature learning method named LEDF for person re-identification in camera networks, which <b>trains</b> <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> network in a local way. There are two characteristics of the proposed LEDF.

Second, all local summing maps of a pedestrian image are connected to form the holistic summing map. The holistic summing maps have the same labels with the original images, and contain the local and global information. We learn the identification network by taking the holistic summing maps as input, and then extract the final LEDF. The experimental results have indicated that the proposed LEDF improves the performance of person re-identification in camera networks.|$|R

This research was conducted to assess the effect of maternal identity development education on the maternity role attainment and my baby perception of primigravidas. MethodsThe research {{was carried out by}} using pretest-posttest quasi-experimental model with control group. A total of 120 mothers and their babies participated in this study. In the collection of the data, Personal Information Form, Semantic Differentation Scale-Myself as Mother and My Baby and the Pharis Self-Confidence Scale were used. ResultsIt was detected that <b>the</b> <b>training</b> of <b>identification</b> development given for the mothers increased score averages taken from the scales of Myself as Mother, My Baby and the Pharis Self-Confidence Scale; this increase was statistically significant. There was a significant positive correlation between the Pharis Self-Confidence Scale post-test score averages and scales of Myself as Mother and My Baby. ConclusionsNurses should offer maternal identity development education, support the baby perception process in the early postnatal stages, and help develop the self-confidence of the mother in order for mothers to develop successful motherhood behaviors. Maternal identity development education should be routinely offered to all expectant mothers by specialized nurses, not just to primigravidas.
