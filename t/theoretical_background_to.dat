There is no similar <b>theoretical</b> <b>background</b> <b>to</b> element meditation in the early Buddhist texts, where the elements appear simply as suitable objects of meditation.

About the same time, innovators like Eli Whitney (1765-1825), James Watt (1736-1819), and Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) developed elements of technical production such as standardization, quality-control procedures, cost-accounting, interchangeability of parts, and work-planning.

50|$|Deliberate {{shaping of}} moulded tyre tread design, {{rather than merely}} concentrating on a rubber surface that didn't fail rapidly, began {{at the start of}} the 1920s. There was little <b>theoretical</b> <b>background</b> <b>to</b> this though until the mid-1920s. The 1922 London Motor Show {{displayed}} a range of tread patterns that were reported on by The Autocar. Some of these, from Miller and the French firm of , display what would now be recognised as the classic bar grip pattern of sharp-edged transverse bars with a wide central rib. However these were supplied for narrow high-pressure tyres, for use on roads and at relatively high speeds. Their design was based on simple notions of transverse bars giving fore-and-aft traction, without any developed theory of tread design or experimental measurements of their performance. In practice, such square-edged tread blocks wore badly and unevenly, the initially flat blocks tending to wear with a sloping top surface. This wear pattern was one reason for the practicing of rotating tyres between wheels, so that they spent equal periods wearing in each direction.|$|E

Some of his publications focus on textual representation {{of social and political}} issues, human rights, and ideology. His current research concerns the intersection of literature, journalism and politics and the social space in Modern Latin America and Spain. His broad research interests are in literary studies and comparative representations of spirituality and the politics of text within the Hispanic world. His research uses a strong philological and <b>theoretical</b> <b>background</b> <b>to</b> expand his literary and cultural analysis of texts as a product of humanistic, anthropological and social constructs. He has done extensive research on the connections of literature and social politics in the Hispanic world. Acereda has written extensively on Latin American and Spanish poetics, its connections to social issues such as human rights and he has held teaching appointments in Spain and the United States.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary ecologists and {{population}} biologists have recently considered that ecological and evolutionary changes are intimately linked and can {{occur on the}} same time-scale. Recent theoretical developments have shown how the feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can be linked, and there are now empirical demonstrations showing that ecological change can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We also have evidence that microevolutionary change can leave an ecological signature. We are at a stage where the integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances {{in our understanding of}} the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity. This special feature about ‘eco-evolutionary dynamics’ brings together biologists from empirical and <b>theoretical</b> <b>backgrounds</b> <b>to</b> bridge the gap between ecology and evolution and provide a series of contributions aimed at quantifying the interactions between these fundamental processes...|$|R
