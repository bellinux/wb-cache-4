40|$|Across the country, {{thousands}} of fuel storage tanksare {{owned and operated}} by industries, agribusi-nesses, and municipalities. Yet most owners or opera-tors have little idea of the age or condition of these tanks even though they represent a growing threat to the environmental and financial security of their com-munity. There is special concern for underground storage tanks (USTs), because they may be leaking with no visible evidence until serious environmental pollution problems have occurred. Millions of gallons of groundwater and large areas of soil may become severely contaminated before a problem is ever rec-ognized from the surface. Most commercial and municipal USTs are gov-erned by strict federal and state regulations. Most states are beginning to apply similar regulations to aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) as well. These regulations require owners and operators to manage <b>and</b> maintain <b>tanks</b> so that they do not severely dam-age the environment. By properly installing well-de-signed <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> by upgrading existing <b>tanks,</b> com-mercial <b>and</b> municipal UST operators can greatly reduce the associated liability of owning USTs. Installation Requirements Certified UST installers should be used for all regulated tanks. The EPA requires that UST installers be certified by the <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> <b>piping</b> manufacture or by the state implementing agency. The Alabama Depart-ment Of Environmental Management (ADEM) is cur-rently working on a certification program for UST in-stallers. Since practices vary from state to state, UST owners and operators should verify the procedures re-quired by their designated state UST agency. More than half the states have their own certification proce-dures. Owners or operators should make certain, in writ-ing, that the tank system they select is compatible with the product to be stored <b>and</b> that the <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> <b>piping</b> meets the standards of trade associations or testing firms such as the Steel Tank Institute (STI) ...|$|R

The robot is spheroidal with a smooth surface and no external appendages. It propels itself with centrifugal pumps which suck in water from the environment, and pump it out in various directions. This thesis covers the design and implementation of the software, electrical, and a few mechanical systems of the robot. Specifically, it details the programming techniques for the microcontroller and graphical user interface code, circuit board design, wiring, and waterproofing.

The presence of fluoride in the mixture is undesired because the fluoride ions are corrosive to <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> <b>piping</b> systems <b>and</b> the fluoride ions cause interferences in the spectrophotometric analyses.

In the dissolution process, the cerium(IV) ions are reduced to cerium(III) ions, which are not oxidants. Therefore, an electrolytic process was incorporated to continuously convert cerium(III) ions back to cerium(IV) ions so that they can dissolve more of the oxide compounds.
