25|$|These rural {{appliances}} {{are extremely}} important for keeping South Australia protected from fires. Almost every town in South Australia would {{have at least}} two of these rural fire trucks. The reason that there are many different types of rural trucks, is because the terrain changes a lot in South Australia. A 14 appliance, only carries 1000 litres nominally but is extremely useful for getting into small tracks which larger appliances can not. Large 34s often have trouble in getting into smaller areas. 24s are the most common, because they are not too heavy and big, but carry a reasonable amount of water, which can last a good time before having to fill up. In most parts of South Australia outside major centres there is no water mains, so this is where Bulk Water Carriers come in handy. These BWCs, often at a rural fire, will be stationary at the edge of it, for smaller trucks to fill up from. when empty it is <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> go and find water in places including, rivers, dams, swimming pools and water tanks.|$|E

2500|$|Parliamentary {{systems have}} the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> the {{expectations}} of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal. In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the [...] "loyal opposition". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.|$|E

2500|$|Part {{and parcel}} to {{intelligence}} operations, the SD carefully tracked foreign opinion and criticism of Nazi policies, censoring when necessary and likewise publishing hostile political cartoons in the SS weekly magazine, Das Schwarze Korps. An additional task {{assigned to the}} SD and the Gestapo was keeping tabs on {{the morale of the}} German population at large, which meant they were charged to [...] "carefully supervise the political health of the German ethnic body" [...] and once any symptoms of [...] "disease and germs" [...] appeared, it was <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> [...] "remove them by every appropriate means." [...] Regular reports - ranging from opinion polls, press dispatches, and information bulletins were established. These were monitored and reviewed by then head of the Inland-SD, Otto Ohlendorf (responsible for intelligence and security within Germany) and the former Heidelberg professor and SD member Reinhard Höhn, all designed to control and assess the [...] "life domain" [...] or Lebensgebiet of the German population. Gathered information was then distributed by the SD through secret internal political reports entitled Meldungen aus dem Reich (reports from the Reich) to the upper echelons of the Nazi Party, enabling Hitler's regime to evaluate the general morale and attitude of the German people so it could be timely manipulated by the Nazi propaganda machine. When the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935, the SD reported that the measures against the Jews were well received by the German populace.|$|E
