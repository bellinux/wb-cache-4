5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath <b>the</b> <b>Genesis.</b> Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E

5|$|The 32X is {{considered}} a commercial failure. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price {{of the system and}} power expansion to <b>the</b> <b>Genesis.</b> Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for <b>the</b> <b>Genesis.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Genesis</b> was {{the first}} Sega console to receive {{third-party}} versions. Its first variants were released before any Master System variants, even though <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> was released {{three years after the}} Master System. Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega, a Mega Drive and Mega CD combination with high quality audio, in Japan on April 1, 1992. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. A Pioneer LaserActive add-on pack, developed by Sega, allows the system to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox. Several companies added <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the MSX models AX-330 and AX-990 distributed in Kuwait and Yemen, and the Amstrad Mega PC distributed in Europe and Australia. After <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> 3 in North America as a budget version of the console in 1998. Majesco also released a budget version of the Sega Pico in North America in August 1999.|$|E

5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> version, Dynamite Headdy {{has continued to}} receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, but it makes sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing {{the same level of}} excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> era {{and one of the best}} platformers on the system.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Genesis</b> {{library was}} {{initially}} modest, but eventually grew to contain games {{to appeal to}} all types of players. The initial pack-in title was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog. Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog, its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Disney's Aladdin. During development for the console, Sega Enterprises in Japan focused on developing action games while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A {{large part of the}} appeal of <b>the</b> <b>Genesis</b> library during the console's lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, as well as more difficult entries such as Ecco the Dolphin and sports games such as Joe Montana Football. Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat.|$|E

The console and its games continue to be popular among game fans, game music fans, collectors, and emulation enthusiasts. By the mid 2010s, licensed third party re-releases of the console were still being sold by AtGames in North America and Europe. Many games have been re-released in compilations for newer consoles and offered for download on various online services, such as the Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam. <b>The</b> <b>Genesis</b> was succeeded by the Sega Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{can only}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a Genesis system, attaching through an expansion slot {{on the side of the}} main console.
