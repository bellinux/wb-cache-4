Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Martin {{launched}} his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, The Dean Martin Show, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again {{the following three}} years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, hitting on women with remarks <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts. During an interview on the British TV documentary Wine, Women and Song, aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership {{is the subject of}} a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.|$|E

500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe.

Koda was interviewed in the February 2012 issue of Japan's magazine ViVi, and stated that her main inspiration behind Japonesque was the dominance of Korean music over Japanese music. Koda stated that whilst touring in Vietnam, Singapore, and Taiwan, Korean pop music became hugely recognized within the Asian and Western territories whilst Japanese music was not; she felt that Japonesque [...] "was driven to make an album <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> played abroad and allow people outside of Japan to enjoy J-pop."

Compelled by the 1979 energy crisis, and after development and testing with government fleets by the CTA at São José dos Campos, and further testing of several prototypes developed by the four local carmakers, including Volkswagen do Brasil, neat ethanol vehicles were launched in the Brazilian market.

2500|$|The band {{gained some}} much-needed {{publicity}} in September 1969, with the Concerto for Group and Orchestra, a three-movement epic composed by Lord {{as a solo}} project and performed by the band at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold. Together with Days of Future Passed by the Moody Blues and Five Bridges by the Nice, {{it was one of}} the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra. This live album became their first album with any kind of chart success in the UK. Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as [...] "a group who played with orchestras", both feeling that the Concerto was a distraction <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance [...] "you could put the five smiles together, and it would have spanned the Thames." [...] Lord would also write the Gemini Suite, another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the Concerto for Group and Orchestra wasn't bad but the Gemini Suite was horrible and very disjointed. Roger Glover later claimed Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Sheila Prophet of Record Mirror {{felt the}} album was [...] "worth giving a spin" [...] and said: [...] "This is their {{comeback}} album - the one that'll make 'em or break 'em. It features [...] "Gypsy Roadhog" [...] {{and most of the}} other tracks are in the same vein - solid, rocking numbers, but just not quite distinctive enough {{to make it in the}} same way as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] did. Part of the problem is that they seem to be trying too hard - laying everything on, instead of sticking with simplicity. The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still sounds great, and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything. In the old days, lyrics weren't too important to Slade, but now they're writing songs with meaning." [...] Pete Makowski of New Musical Express wrote: [...] "The band were always on form when they worked within the most basic of formats. Rock and Roll! This album is high energy on a primeval scale. It's got all the ball bustin' riffs you'll find nestling comfortably alongside yer ZZ Tops and Nugents. It's got the same suicidal pace of the Aerosmith Rocks album. It's packed with strong tunes, lotsa potential singles and the lyrical content is more interesting." [...] Tony Ciarochi of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said: [...] "...their latest album definitely packs the kind of punch <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> that kind of reaction from a crowd of concert goers. Although it is fairly basic rock 'n' roll, the British humor and sarcasm with which it is presented make it a refreshing chance from some of the more bland sledgehammer rock grounds dominant in America." ...|$|E
