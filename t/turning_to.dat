5|$|A {{very active}} trough of low {{pressure}} persisted along the equator {{in the middle}} of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140° W to 140° E. An organized circulation developed near Palmyra Atoll on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward. Though very late in the season, warm temperatures to the south of the Hawaiian Islands due to the strongest El Nino in many years allowed the disturbance to develop into Tropical Storm Iwa on November 19 while located about 970miles (1,760km) southwest of the southernmost point in Hawaii. The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm. After <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, Iwa began slowly intensifying, and on November 23 after <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the north-northwest Iwa strengthened into a hurricane while located 580miles (930km) southwest of the southern tip of Hawaii.|$|E
