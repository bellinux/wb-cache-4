Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Williams quotes music publisher Paul Case as having said during this period: [...] "Phil wants a hit record with Ronnie again more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.

[...] Eric Goldman of IGN felt that [...] "Jessica Jones starts out with a strong premiere episode that...easily goes further <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MCU in terms of sexuality." [...] He called Ritter [...] "a commendably tough, sardonic" [...] Jessica Jones and praised the supporting cast for the strong impressions they made, later scoring the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Evan Valentine of Collider.com gave the episode 5 stars out of 5, feeling that Tennant would [...] "ascend to {{the same level as}} Tom Hiddleston’s Loki and Vincent D'Onofrio’s Wilson Fisk as one of the cornerstones of villainy in the MCU". Katharine Trendacosta of io9 also had positive thoughts on [...] "AKA Ladies Night", highlighting the episode's use of light and color, especially with purple, and the way it portrays New York as how it [...] "actually looks—not overly bright and shiny and clean, but not suffering a never-ending power-outage either". Abraham Riesman noted the episode's presentation of sexuality, which [...] "was shockingly and refreshingly honest", compared to Marvel's other films and television series.

500|$|One {{day in the}} mid-1990s, Smith was at {{her home}} talking {{to one of her}} {{daughter}}s on the phone. After telling her mother {{what she was going to}} that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997), acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. Consisting of ten tracks, nine of them were co-written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music: The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded [...] "far gutsier <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Reba and Garth mainstream". Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a solid effort", also commenting, [...] "...it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer." ...|$|E
