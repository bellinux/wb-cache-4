40|$|Intercultural {{traffic and}} {{mingling}} have been vital to economic innovation, past and present, witness {{the role of}} travellers, migrants and diasporas as cultural brokers. While intercultural exchange is a prominent theme in cultural studies, studies of ethnicity have often been more occupied by group boundaries and antagonisms than cross-group relations. In relation to social capital a central notion has been the ethnic economy. Here this notion is rejected because in effect it refers to national origin rather than ethnicity and diverts attention from social and economic relations across cultural differences and boundaries. While immigrant groups may play a large part in national and <b>transnational</b> <b>enterprise,</b> formal and informal, this is not conceivable without considerable and extensive crosscultural relations. In the interstices of studies of migration and ethnic economies there are sporadic references to interethnic economies. The shift of emphasis to crosscultural enterprise means taking into account bonding, bridging and linking social capital within and across cultural boundaries. Much literature and reporting on ethnicity is fraught with friction, tension, antagonism. Virtually per definition we only hear of ethnicity when it generates problems, oppression, conflict, {{in line with the}} media principle "When it bleeds it leads". But what of the situations when ethnicity does not entail conflict or when conflict is only minor? Here the distinction between bonding social capital (strong ties among close relations), bridging social capital (weak ties among people from different backgrounds but similar socioeconomic status) and linking social capital ("friends in high placesâ€™") takes on cultural dimensions: each apply within and across cultural settings. The question of cultural difference and social capital arises in three different contexts: immigration and migration, <b>transnational</b> <b>enterprise,</b> and ethnically diverse societies. social capital;migration;ethnic economies;cultural difference...|$|E

For this reason, central-governments in OECD countries compete with each other, for the attraction of fdi-inflows, especially through the supply of tax- incentives, such as the level of tax-rate or the adopted tax – system. But, the existing theoretical studies about factors affecting fdi inflows have not reached to a clear-cut theoretical framework. In the same way, the results of existing empirical studies are also diverse. Empirical studies, in other words, differ according to the methodologies that are applied, the explanatory- variables, the controlvariables, the data-sources as well as the countries or regions that are chosen.

With global <b>transnational</b> <b>enterprise</b> layout trend, data consistency convergence study is a key of improving competitions and Bullwhip Effect problem in the GSCM. Besides, data consistency issues might induce different dependency relations in different extranet applications and partial dependency to several distributed original data source (ODS). In this paper, we consider the problem and solve it using a service routable consistency framework (Distributed Heterogeneous Web Service Routing based Portal; DHWSRP). The model based on a scalable routing service algorithm that dynamic reconfiguration forwarding data path within hierarchical enterprise region portals. By ripple propagate updating; SCM copies that existed in heterogeneity of enterprise database with specified ODS partially dependency relationships can be automatically updated. About efficient integrate SCM partner, we propose a Dynamic Information Exchange Center (DIEC) for creating a dynamic supply chain network in an Internet environment. Agent technology supports users in negotiating with upstream suppliers or downstream demanders and making decisions regarding partner selection. The framework allows enterprises to find more opportunities to cooperate with other partners. In business, such a framework not only reduces purchase costs and saves time for enterprises in reaching agreement but also eliminate Bullwhip Effect problem in GSCM...|$|E
40|$|Study of {{the history}} of the {{overseas}} Chinese is an important issue in the field of History study. Among all, study {{of the history}} of the overseas Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia are most important and popular. Because of their ideal geographical location, Singapore and Malaysia served as a window for the western countries to develop Southeast Asia and constructed a close economic relationship with South China. In the study of Overseas Chinese history, remittance is one on the topic that cannot be neglect. The literature nowadays is mainly concerning the remittance method, amount, organization and the effect of remittance on the homeland of the overseas Chinese. However, remittance network is seldom concerned. Actually, remittance network represents the financial network that connecting South China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia together. It’s because remittance not only mean remit money to homeland, but also mean a close trading and investment relationship. This financial network, in a large extent, is based on the remittance network of the local remittance houses, with the two main centers of Singapore and Hong Kong. This flow of the capital provided a closer economic relationship and encouraged the economic development between South China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Remittance network is based on the remittance houses, however, seldom case study on remittance house is available. Thus, it’s difficult to analysis the structure, change and the flow of capital of the remittance network. And Eu Yan Sang, a family business that established by Eu Ton Sang, was a large remittance house before the Second World War. Eu Yan Sang’s business covered China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, was a <b>transnational</b> <b>enterprise.</b> By studying the remittance business of Eu Yan Sang, we can have a better understanding of the remittance network in Southeast Asia and how this network will change it’s structure when facing economic transformation.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the small <b>transnational</b> <b>enterprises</b> of recent Chinese entrepreneur immigrants to Vancouver, Canada. These enterprises {{are part of the}} globalization process and contribute to the economic and cultural integration of certain regions of Asia with large urban areas of Canada. The entrepreneurs are analyzed utilizing a transnationalism framework which is situated in the ethnic enterprise literature. The article explains how these transnational small Chinese businesses are different from the businesses of earlier Chinese in Canada. A detailed analysis of the Canadian Business Immigration Program illustrates how and why small Chinese <b>transnational</b> <b>enterprises</b> have emerged. The primary data comes from extensive in-depth interviews with 61 Chinese entrepreneur immigrants that allows for the delineation of three transnational business types: (1) Asian production-North American distribution, (2) retail chains and (3) import-export. Quantitative data illustrate the major differences between 'transnational' and 'non-transnational' enterprises along several variables. Other qualitative data provide insights on how family networks are interwoven with firm relations in small transnational businesses, how entrepreneurs perceive interethnic relations {{and the extent to which}} they experience barriers to mobility. Evidence is provided of extensive transmigration and, in contrast to the sojourner identity of earlier Chinese, the data here suggests the emergence of a new transnational and cosmopolitan identity amongst entrepreneur immigrants.
