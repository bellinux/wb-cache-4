5|$|The Confederate {{trousers}} {{were very}} {{similar to those of the}} Union forces. Early on, the trousers were sky blue in color. They were most often made of wool, and were easily worn during long marches. If trousers did not arrive for the troops the soldiers would have to use their own pants to wear. Regimental and company officers wore the colors of their respective branch on the outer seam of <b>their</b> <b>pants</b> on one and one-quarter inch stripes. Generals wore two and five-eighths inch stripes on each pant leg. While the quartermasters, commissary, and engineer officers wore a single magenta, one and one-quarter inch outer-seam stripe. Non-commissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
25|$|Hardalim {{typically}} {{dress like}} most modern Orthodox religious Zionists would, but place a slightly larger emphasis on appearing neat, wearing their tzitzit out of <b>their</b> <b>pants,</b> {{and wearing a}} significantly larger yarmulke. Like other religious Zionists, they usually wear colored knitted yarmulkes. In contrast to Haredim, many Hardalim do not wear only white shirts or a black outfit, and {{only a handful of}} Hardalim wear a jacket and a hat; these are usually only worn by the highest levels of rabbinic leadership of the Hardal world.|$|E
25|$|Accompanying {{the white}} clown {{there is often}} another clown variety known as an auguste or red clown; the auguste's role is {{different}} from that of the white clown. In strict classical European circuses of the past, the augustes were never described as clowns because, technically, they were not instigators but recipients of the comic doings. The augustes are the ones who get the pies in the face, are squirted with water, are knocked down on their backside, sit accidentally in wet paint, or have <b>their</b> <b>pants</b> ripped off.|$|E

25|$|The Korean {{word for}} trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in {{recorded}} history {{around the turn}} of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear <b>their</b> <b>pants</b> (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighth}} lunar month of 189, the eunuchs hatched {{a plot to}} assassinate He Jin. They issued a fake {{imperial}} order in Empress Dowager He's name, instructing He Jin to enter the palace to meet her. He Jin fell into an ambush and died {{at the hands of}} the eunuchs, who declared him guilty of treason. After He Jin's death, his subordinates Wu Kuang (吳匡) and Zhang Zhang (張璋), along with Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and others, led their troops to storm the palace and kill the eunuchs in revenge. They indiscriminately slaughtered anyone who looked like a eunuch; some young men who had no facial hair, in desperation, dropped <b>their</b> <b>pants</b> in front of the soldiers to prove that they were not eunuchs. During the attack, the eunuchs took Empress Dowager He, Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu (Liu Xie) hostage and tried to flee from the palace. Lu Zhi intercepted the eunuch Duan Gui (段珪) and saved the empress dowager from him. He Miao, who was sympathetic towards the eunuchs, was killed by Wu Kuang and Dong Zhuo's younger brother Dong Min (董旻). Over 2,000 people died in the attack. Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu, who were taken out of the palace by the eunuchs during the chaos, were eventually found near the riverbank and saved by Lu Zhi and Min Gong (閔貢), who brought them back safely.|$|E
500|$|As part {{of their}} in-ring personas, MNM had a {{distinctive}} ring entrance. They walked to the ring on a red carpet, while members of the [...] "paparazzi" [...] took photos of them. The male members of MNM usually wore fur coats to the ring. As they took them off, Melina suggestively rubbed their abs while removing the title belts from <b>their</b> <b>pants,</b> where they hung in an exaggerated phallic fashion. Melina has a signature entrance which involves her doing a split on the ring apron—from the floor—then bending forward and crawling under the bottom rope.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} whale tails {{suffered}} a bit of a backlash. Trinny Woodall, presenter of BBC1's What Not to Wear, described women who wore thongs showing above their trousers as [...] "disgusting". Jessica Kaminsky wrote in I Hate the Gym, a lifestyle commentary, [...] "I hate when girls let their 'whale tails' creep out of their pants." [...] In 2007, religious writer Tamie Bixler Lung wrote, [...] "There is something wrong when Christian guys and girls want to run around with their underwear hanging out the top of <b>their</b> <b>pants,</b> or their thong strap sticking out the back of their low-rise jeans."

500|$|Like Salafists, Tabligh seek a [...] "separation {{in their}} daily life from the `impious` society that {{surrounded}} them". The only objective of Tabligh Jamaat, overtly stated in most sermons, is that Muslims adopt and invite for the Islamic lifestyle, exemplified by Muhammad, in its perfection. This involves a detailed orthopraxy: [...] "followers must dress like the Prophet, sleep as he did on the ground, on one's right side"; enter bathrooms leading with the left foot, but put pants on leading with the right foot; do not use a fork when eating, instead use your index finger, middle finger and thumb; men shave their upper lips, but let their beards grow; <b>their</b> <b>pants</b> or robes should be above the ankle [...] "because the prophet said letting clothes drag {{on the ground is}} a sign of arrogance".|$|E
500|$|People Carrie Bell {{enjoyed the}} episode, praising {{the balance of}} cast members. She called Isaac [...] "beloved", {{and found that the}} {{teamwork}} in the episode proved [...] "there's no 'I' in team". Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall gave a positive review of the entry, applauding the shift in themes and Shepherd's character development. Writing for BuddyTV, Glenn Diaz found the episode comical, calling the scene in which Robbins stands up to Webber [...] "hilarious", and naming Yang the installment's [...] "comic relief". Referring to Shepherd and Webber's constant arguments, an AfterEllen senior editor said: [...] "Seriously, these two need to drop <b>their</b> <b>pants</b> and get it over with." [...] Peter Nowalk's writing of the episode was nominated for a Humanitas Prize in the 60 Minute Category. The episode also earned Wilson an NAACP Image Award under the Outstanding Directing in a Dramatic Series category.|$|E

500|$|In the 1990 film The Spirit of '76, Rob Reiner plays [...] "Dr. Hedley Cash" [...] (referred to only as [...] "Dr. Cash" [...] in the film), {{an abusive}} trainer for the est-like [...] "Be, Inc. Seminars" [...] who traps time-traveler Heinz-57 (played by Geoff Hoyle) {{in one of}} his {{seminars}} and continually refers to him as [...] "Heinz Asshole". [...] In the DVD commentary for the 2003 release of the film, director Lucas Reiner stated that the [...] "Absentee, oblivious, self-involved parents who don't notice their kids have a spaceship" [...] was a reference to the self-involved nature of adults during the 1970s and their propensity for self-improvement. [...] Reiner stated that these scenes were meant to symbolize the [...] "'70s hunger for self-improvement" [...] and the extreme ends that people would go to in order to improve themselves. [...] Lucas Reiner had never personally attended one of Werner Erhard's seminars, but had heard that attendants were not allowed to leave, often peed in <b>their</b> <b>pants,</b> and were called [...] "assholes" [...] and insulted publicly. [...] Reiner noted that once his brother Carl put on the [...] "Dr. Cash" [...] costume, he played his character perfectly.|$|E
500|$|Although {{all of the}} orphanage's {{residents}} were given a dose of Epsom salts once {{a week in the}} morning, some former residents have given accounts of brutal punishments and mistreatment. One states that because there were 200 boys and only 12 toilets, some would defecate in the urinals, drains, on the grass, or in <b>their</b> <b>pants.</b> As a result, the boys would receive beltings for doing this. Another account by a boy who stayed at the orphanage states that when he arrived there, he was separated from his brother and was given a set of clothes to wear despite having his own. Anyone who did not comply would receive a belting. The boys were issued no underwear and clothes were [...] washed only once a week. Beatings were common, and not just for punishment; sometimes it may have been more for mental scarring. Other accounts claim there were beatings, and repetitive rape, not only by the staff but also by older boys and the orphanage caretaker. Despite this, some former residents say the nuns were [...] "tough but fair" [...] and they [...] were fed three meals a day. Some even stayed in contact with their caregivers once they left.|$|E

2500|$|A gold {{miniature}} charm {{depicting a}} pair of football pants is given to all players and coaches following a victory over the Michigan Wolverines.

They put <b>their</b> <b>pants</b> on one leg at a time, the same as we do!"

The Ombudsman's report recommended schools' guidelines be amended to make anti-bullying programmes compulsory in schools.
