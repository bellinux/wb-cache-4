5000|$|Isuzu of Japan {{introduced}} the KB20 / 25 series Faster pickup in 1972. The regular wheelbase models were designated [...] "20", while [...] "25" [...] {{referred to the}} longer version. Derived from the Isuzu Florian, the Faster shared many components, including doors and the front-end assemblage. It served {{as a replacement for}} the Isuzu Wasp, a pickup version of the Bellett which preceded the Florian. Both single and <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> front fascia designs were produced.|$|E
50|$|The E-Class image {{suffered}} {{a downturn in}} the late 1990s and early 2000s. Things started to improve but it wasn't until {{the introduction of the}} W212 series that things really picked up. The W212 series took the E-Class's original reputation for solid build quality and refined elegance and established it once again. It is also praised for having a differentiated design from the contemporary C-Class and S-Class models. Although the mid-cycle refresh was overwhelmingly praised; the design received mixed opinions as Mercedes decided to take a more streamlined direction with the redesign, replacing the <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> design with a single lens design, which brought the E-Class design up to date with the contemporary Mercedes-Benz design language.|$|E

50|$|The S-series Bentley {{was given}} the Rolls-Royce - Bentley L Series V8 engine in late 1959, and {{designated}} the S2. <b>Twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> and a facelift to the front arrived in late 1962, resulting in the model designation S3.|$|R
5000|$|The 1995 WS and onward models also {{featured}} a race-style braced swing-arm (in {{place of the}} asymmetrical 'banana' swing-arm found on the WP and WR models).Overall peak power (approx a measured 133 bhp at the rear wheel - which made the then enormous factory claims of 155 bhp, which many were sceptical of, at the crank perfectly credible) was unchanged but the torque curve on the bike was much improved.From the 1995 models weight fell back 221 kg (487 lbs) in the UK market.Some aerodynamic modifications were also introduced (most obviously narrowing the frontal area and reducing {{the size of the}} front fairing, the separate day time driving lamp disappeared and was incorporated into a new narrower <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> cluster) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} steel-framed '3HE' FZR600 remained virtually unchanged {{throughout its}} production. In 1991 the FZR received a single wedge-shaped headlamp to ape its FZR1000 EXUP sibling, but Yamaha reverted to the <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> design for 1993. In 1990, {{the rear wheel}} width was increased to 4 inches (as opposed to the 3.5-inch wheel which was stock for the 1989 model). In the same year the front brake calipers were upgraded to 4-piston units (as opposed to the 2-piston calipers on the 1989 model). In 1991 the FZR received a different swingarm, which was slightly fatter in profile. Aside from the minor mechanical changes, the paintwork and color schemes were the main change for each new model year, including the Vance and Hines special edition scheme that was available for 1992.|$|E
5000|$|The Austin 3-Litre is a British {{saloon car}} that was {{introduced}} by Austin at the London Motor Show in 1967. It became apparent that BMC were not geared up to producing the car: few or none {{seem to have been}} sold that year, but by July 1968 it was reported that the cars had begun to leave the factory. By that time the square headlights seen at the 1967 motor show had been replaced by conventional round <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> units, and {{by the time of the}} October 1968 show the car had also acquired front quarter lights. [...] In July 1968, with cars beginning to emerge from the plant, the manufacturers were asked to detail improvements reportedly implemented since the car's [...] "launch" [...] the previous October. Mention was made of orifice modifications to hydraulic valves in the rear suspension, and it was stated that there was a [...] "new" [...] final drive ratio of 3.9:1, though this was actually the same final drive ratio included in the launch information the previous October.|$|E
50|$|The sport range {{comprised}} the XR6, which {{was available in}} both sedan and wagon, and the XR8, which was only available in a sedan. Both XR6 and XR8 had bold exterior styling similar to previous XR Falcons, featuring <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> and red or black bumper strips (depending on the body colour) and unique 15-inch alloy wheels.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was also}} {{assembled}} by Scaldia-Volga SA in Brussels, Belgium. In Belgium {{the car was}} sold as the Scaldia 1300/1400, although Scaldia also installed Perkins' 1.8-litre 4.108 engine in the Scaldia Diesel beginning in 1968. This model offered [...] SAE but lacked the <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> of the petrol-engined export 408. Some sources also list the 1.6-litre Perkins 4.99 as having been available earlier.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} few months of 2004, MG Rover facelifted the design of the ZT and ZT-T to a less retro look, at the same time as the Rover 75 {{received}} a facelift. While the facelift didn't feature any mechanical differences, the changes were merely aesthetic and the main changes to the facelift, included the replacement of the <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps,</b> with a new, clear single headlamp unit.|$|R
50|$|Hero motors has {{unveiled}} a new sharper, more busy-looking Karizma and ZMR models. A completely redesigned front fairing features twin stacked headlamps that are nestled between the integrated turn indicators. The indicators are also surrounded by LED daytime running lamps. The Karizma R 2014 {{has undergone a}} rather thorough cosmetic overhaul. The fairing on the Karizma is basically a low key version of the new ZMR fairing. Other changes to the fairing include mounted ORVMs, “R Premium Sports” decals and a <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> arrangement. Similarities with previous versions include- the suspension and wheels, fuel tank and a drum brake in the rear. Through the styling too, {{emphasis is on the}} raw power of the bike.The rear end of the motorcycle has also received a much-needed visual weight reduction with a new split seat design and tapering tail section. The brake light and rear turn indicators are now housed in a neat floating tail section that also houses the number plate. The bike now features a set of fixed clip on style bars similar to the outgoing ZMR model and both bikes will ride on wider tyres than the older model.|$|E
50|$|The {{front was}} {{completely}} restyled, {{giving it a}} more aggressive look compared to the pre-facelift model. The <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> design was replaced with a singular front light (marking the end of Mercedes's dual headlamps use) with LED DRLs lights as standard, while full LED technology was available as an option {{for the first time}} for the E-Class. One thing new was the option of a front grille with a Mercedes-Benz star on it, an option previously unavailable on the E-Class and only used on smaller models like the C-Class (W204). The front bumper was made more sharp with bigger air intakes much like the newer C-Class (W205). In the rear, the car was given a rear LED taillights, while Sport models feature exposed dual exhaust pipes. The doors and front fenders were re-shaped, eliminating the wheel arch bulge and replacing it with a more traditional character line in the sheet metal. The lower side crease line (which replaced the pre-facelift model's side chrome trim) extends from the rear door {{all the way to the}} front fender, hence all the side panels except for the rear quarter panel has also been restyled.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 (for the 2014 model year), the E-Class was {{comprehensively}} facelifted. Daimler invested {{close to}} €1 billion into {{the development of}} the extensive refresh, making it likely the most expensive mid-life facelift {{in the history of the}} automobile. The front fascia was heavily restyled, giving it a more aggressive look compared to the pre-facelift model. The biggest change was the singular front lights replacing the <b>twin</b> <b>headlamp</b> design (marking the end of Mercedes's dual headlamps use) with LED DRLs. In addition, the rear fender and back door sheet metal was changed to carry the rear wheel well character line straight forward. The rear tail lamps were also redesigned. The facelift was meant to make it more appealing to younger customers, who prefer its newer rivals (Audi A6 (4G) and BMW 5 Series) for their more modern looks. Most of the engines remained unchanged from the previous model. The Coupé and Cabrio shared a more aggressive, swifter look than the sedan, with a more svelte front fascia and a sleeker bonnet. Although not an all-new model, majority of the auto world have stated that the updated design and several changes make the car more than a regular mid-cycle refresh. On a family portrait of several generations of the E-Class side by side by Mercedes-Benz for the unveiling of the W213 E-Class, the W212 facelift was the only mid-cycle refresh featured in the image.|$|E
50|$|The Optare Excel was a low-floor {{full-size}} single-decker bus {{manufactured by}} Optare. Manufactured {{as an integral}} bus, the Excel was launched in 1995 {{as one of the}} first low floor single-deck vehicles, replacing the step-entrance Optare Sigma. The styling of the body was in keeping with existing Optare products. At the front, a simple flat panel with the Optare name was set between two pairs of <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps,</b> below a very large front windscreen. Approximately 600 were built.|$|R
5000|$|The Renault 19 16S hot hatch (16V in some countries), {{added to}} the lineup {{in the autumn of}} 1990, was the only Renault 19 with 16-valve engine. It had a {{distinctive}} air inlet on the bonnet, a rear spoiler, 15 inch [...] "Speedline" [...] alloy wheels, side skirts, <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps,</b> Recaro bucket seats with optional leather trim, 4-in-1 exhaust manifold and ABS braking system with optional trip computer, aircon and electric sunroof. The [...] "S" [...] is for Soupapes, French for valves. It was praised for its excellent handling and rev-happy F7P engine which along with the advanced Renix ECU made it faster and more fuel efficient compared to most competitors. The braking system was uprated to include 259 mm vented discs on the front and 237 mm discs on the rear as well as an uprated lower suspension setup and front strut bar. Phase 1 editions benefited from unique front and rear bumpers with front indicators relocated into the bumpers to allow for the <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps,</b> while the Phase 2 retained the original bumpers found throughout the range but added colour-coded tops, rubber inserts, and a discreet lower splitter.|$|R
50|$|Categorised by India Yamaha Motor as a Sport Tourer, this {{motorcycle}} {{is identical}} to the Yamaha FZ16 and Yamaha FZ-S in every aspect except that the Fazer has a semi-fairing and <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> at the front. The riding posture of the bike has also been adjusted a bit to make long hours of riding easier for the rider. Like the FZ16 and the FZ-S, the Fazer has Monocross suspension. The Fazer has a 140/60-17 size rear radial tyre with a 60% aspect ratio.|$|R
50|$|The third-batch build of locos (EF60 84 to 129 and EF60 512 to 514) had up-rated {{traction}} motors and differed slightly in having <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> (like the EF65 and other later types) {{rather than the}} single large headlamp on earlier versions. Unlike the ED60s, these locos were designed to operate singly rather than in pairs, and so cab-end gangway doors were not included. The EF60-0s initially appeared in the standard all-over brown livery, but were repainted into blue from 1965 onward.|$|R

50|$|The L {{was a more}} comfortably {{equipped}} base version, {{with the}} XL adding certain luxuries such as height adjustable front seats, a clock, and larger headlights. The sporty GT (not available as a 1.3, as for the GXL) received bucket seats with built-in headrests, full instrumentation, a leather steering wheel, and <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> amongst other equipment. Lastly, the top-of-the-line GXL added all the comforts of the XL with the sporty equipment of the GT and additional extras such as a vinyl roof, a dual-tone horn, and deeper carpeting.|$|R
50|$|The Dacia {{automobile}} {{company was}} founded in 1966 under the name Uzina de Autoturisme Pitești (UAP). The main Dacia factory was built in 1968, in Colibași (now called Mioveni), near Pitești.Dacia acquired the tooling and basic designs of the Renault 12. However, until the tooling was ready {{it was decided to}} produce the Renault 8 under licence; it was known as the Dacia 1100.From 1968 to 1972, 37,546 cars of model 1100 were produced, with a very minor cosmetic change to the front in early 1970. Also produced in very limited numbers was the 1100S, with <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> and a more powerful engine, used by the police and in motor racing.|$|R
5000|$|The larger-sized 1958 Ramblers {{incorporated}} [...] "more than 100 {{changes and}} were outwardly {{quite different from}} their predecessors." [...] The cars received [...] "a complete reskin that made the 1956 bodies look a bit bulkier". This major redesign featured new front and rear fenders. A new front end moved the headlamps from inside the grille {{to the top of}} the front fenders and featured <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> on each side on the [...] "Super" [...] and [...] "Custom" [...] models, as well as full-length bodyside moldings. The basic [...] "Deluxe" [...] trim models had no side trim and came standard with single headlights, but the new [...] "quad" [...] headlights were optional.|$|R
50|$|The 1979 {{model year}} saw a face lift, with <b>twin</b> {{rectangular}} <b>headlamps</b> replacing the previous quad rectangular headlamp design.The V8 engine option was dropped {{at the end}} of the 1979 model year, as was the 5-speed manual transmission.|$|R
50|$|The car {{was aimed}} at the then-new compact performance-luxury sector, vying for sales against cars such as the BMW 2002 and Ford Cortina GXL, and was offered {{with a high level}} of {{standard}} equipment, including <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps,</b> a clock, full instrumentation, luxury seats and carpets, a heated rear window, and a cigar lighter. Styling was similar to the Triumph 1500, with some updates such as a black painted rear panel, vinyl D-posts, and new wheel trims. The car was capable of 100 mph, with 60 mph coming up in just over 11 seconds. An overdrive gearbox was soon made available as an option, offering relaxed motorway cruising and improved fuel economy, and there was also an optional automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|The first Capella was {{introduced}} in May 1970 and lasted until 1978, and {{was introduced}} as an intermediate alternative to the smaller Mazda Familia and the larger Mazda Luce. It was powered by four-cylinder SOHC valve engines displacing either 1.5 or 1.6 liters. Output is , respectively; and 144 Nm of torque for the larger displacement version. The first models all had rectangular headlights, while the rotary-engined models received round <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> beginning in October 1971. From 1972 all models received the double headlamps. The taillight design was changed repeatedly over the production run. This generation was sold in export markets as the Mazda 616 in sedan and, for some markets, coupé configurations. There was also a Mazda 618 briefly sold in the United States.|$|R
50|$|In early 1969, Chrysler {{realized}} that there were actually two potentially competing cars being developed and called for both the British and the French proposition to be presented before the general management of Chrysler Europe. The decision was taken {{to go ahead with}} the British C Car programme, but to develop two versions for both the UK and the French part of the concern. Chrysler funded a new plant along with a development centre for the Rootes Group at the Whitley plant, Coventry, where the development was continued. Roy Axe employed former Chrysler USA designer Curt Gwinn as project designer, and the C Car took a shape very similar to an enlarged version of Hillman Avenger. Initial designs were inspired by contemporary American Chryslers, with <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> and a light bar in the rear.|$|R
50|$|Of these, {{only the}} BC (BA22d) {{is widely used}} in homes. The BA20d (sometimes called a Bosch fitting) was once a common {{automotive}} (<b>twin</b> filament) <b>headlamp</b> fitting but has largely been superseded by more modern, higher-rated H-series sockets and is only used for some lower-powered applications such as combined automotive tail and stop lamps.|$|R
50|$|In 1985 ICTA {{imported}} 1,300 more KS22 trucks. The Isuzu NPR {{was introduced}} later in mid-1985 with a turbocharged four-cylinder 3.9 L (116 HP) diesel engine.

The fourth Elf/N-series originally had <b>twin</b> rectangular <b>headlamps</b> and a grille with five separate segments (seven for the Wide Cab models).|$|R
50|$|In 1958, the Bonneville {{was first}} given its own {{position}} in the Pontiac lineup as the ultimate Pontiac, and was only available as a two-door hardtop and two-door convertible. While no longer Pontiac's prestige model, the Star Chief remained a well-appointed car, and the division's finest four door hardtops and sedans. The 1958 Star Chief, as {{with the rest of}} the Pontiac lineup, received all-new bodywork and an updated chassis. The body was considerably longer and lower, and featured a new honeycomb grille design and <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps.</b> The sedans and coupé models all shared the longer 124 inch wheelbase, while the Custom Safari model remained on a chassis two inches shorter, shared with the lesser Chieftain. In spite of the new bodywork, sales of the 1958 Star Chief dropped precipitously; down by around 60% while Pontiac's overall sales dropped by more than a third.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to 2006, Dyna models {{typically}} {{featured a}} narrow, XL-style 39mm front fork and front wheel, {{as well as}} footpegs which the manufacturer included the letter [...] "X" [...] in the model designation to indicate. This lineup traditionally included the Super Glide (FXD), Super Glide Custom (FXDC), Street Bob (FXDB), and Low Rider (FXDL). One exception was the Wide Glide (FXDWG), which featured thicker 41mm forks and a narrow front wheel, but positioned the forks on wider triple-trees that give a beefier appearance. In 2008, the Dyna Fat Bob (FXDF) {{was introduced to the}} Dyna lineup, featuring aggressive styling like a new 2–1–2 exhaust, <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps,</b> a 180mm rear tire, and, {{for the first time in}} the Dyna lineup, a 130mm front tire. For the 2012 model year, the Dyna Switchback (FLD) became the first Dyna to break the tradition of having an FX model designation with floorboards, detachable painted hard saddlebags, touring windshield, headlight nacelle and a wide front tire with full fender. [...] The new front end resembled the big-twin FL models from 1968-1971.|$|R
5000|$|The 80 {{first became}} {{available}} with four-wheel drive in 1983. The model was essentially an Ur-Quattro without the turbocharger and with saloon bodywork. The four-wheel drive 80, however, weighed {{more than a}} front-wheel drive Audi 100 CD with the same 2144 cc [...] engine, and with its worse aerodynamics it was slower than the larger, better equipped, and lower-priced 100. Top speeds are 187 and 199 km/h respectively, with similar fuel economy advantages for the larger 100. The 80 quattro received <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps,</b> a front spoiler with integrated foglights, and a body-coloured rubber spoiler on the rear. There was also a [...] "quattro" [...] script on the bootlid and a twin exhaust. The luggage compartment was marginally smaller (mostly in height), which meant only a temporary spare tire could be fitted. The 80 quattro was a bargain compared to the Ur-Quattro, but less so {{in comparison with the}} two-wheel drive 80 GTE or the 100 CD, although they did not offer the impressive road holding that the quattros do.|$|R

5000|$|The facelifted model, never {{offered in}} New Zealand, had <b>twin</b> <b>headlamps</b> as {{standard}} {{and a more}} integrated dash panel. Floor shift, rather than column change, was also standard.In January 1967 domestic market deliveries began of the Vauxhall Cresta estate car. This vehicle resulted from a conversion by Martin Walter of Folkestone, a firm better known for their (primarily Bedford based) Dormobile motorhome conversions. [...] The estate version was 2+1/2 in higher than the saloon due {{to a combination of}} heavy-duty rear suspension, an increase in the outer diameter of the tyres (to 7.00-14 in from 5.90-14in) and the modified roof line. The Cresta estate was initially offered in the UK at £1,507, which represented a price premium of around 40% over the equivalent saloon. [...] The long established Humber Hawk estate and recently introduced Ford Zephyr estate carried UK sales prices of £1,342 and £1,379 respectively. The Cresta estate offered a load platform length of 47 in which increased to an impressive 76 in when the back seat was folded down, but Vauxhall's contender was never priced to be a big seller and the last estate cars were made in 1968.|$|R
