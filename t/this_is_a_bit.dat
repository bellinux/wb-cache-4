25|$|In Menor's Cabin, a small museum {{near the}} south {{entrance}} of Grand Teton National Park and {{adjacent to the}} Chapel of the Transfiguration, {{is a picture of}} young Cliff Hansen and his mother, Sylvia, which was taken in the early 1920s. The photograph is posted under the cattle exhibit and is meant to demonstrate the hardiness of early Wyoming pioneers. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an irony as in 1943 {{he was a member of}} an armed protest of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's designation of the land as Jackson Hole National Monument.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Goram, he {{overheated}} while hard at work, drank a giant {{quantity of}} ale, {{and fell asleep}} in his favourite (stone) chair, whilst Vincent paced himself better and completed his channel. (One version depicts Goram as lazy and Vincent as keen and industrious.) The geographical point is to explain the narrow gorge of the Hazel Brook (a tributary of the river Trym) in Henbury and the dramatic Avon Gorge through which the Avon now flows. The onomastic point is {{to account for the}} name of the Avon Gorge, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> feeble since the river has had this name from time immemorial.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} (VO2) {{during exercise}} is best {{described by the}} Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states {{that the amount of}} oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, {{it is not the only}} determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through blood doping or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, {{the index}} first broke 500. In 1987, the index broke 1000. It closed at 2146.89 on March 9, 2009, having a low {{coincident}} {{with some other}} indices; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> above its low of 1942.19 on March 11, 2003.|$|R
50|$|Ether Song is {{the second}} album by the British rock band Turin Brakes. Following the band's first album The Optimist LP (2001), <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of <b>a</b> departure, relying on more {{electric}} instruments. Despite the change in sound, the album was received well by critics and reached #4 on the United Kingdom album charts.|$|R
50|$|The show {{changed its}} {{timeslot}} in July 2010 {{from the traditional}} 4-7 slot to <b>a</b> 3-6 slot. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of <b>a</b> surprising move as Prime Time Sports' early ratings from 2010 were {{the best in the}} shows history, a 9.2 up from a 7.2. It changed back with the debut of the show Tim and Sid.|$|R

[...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an exaggeration – [...] a nucleus of seven or eight perhaps, because team selection was {{now in the hands of}} the West Indies Cricket Board rather than the colony where the Test match was played.|$|E
2500|$|... 3. The semi-digger moldboard. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{shorter than}} the {{general-purpose}} mouldboard, but with a concave cross-section and a more abrupt curve. Being intermediate between the two moldboards above described, it has a performance that comes in between (approximately 250mm deep) and with less shattering than the digger moldboard. It turns an almost square sectioned furrow and leaves a more broken surface finish. Semi-digger mouldboards can be used at different depths and speeds, making them suitable {{for most of the}} general ploughing on the farm.|$|E

50|$|Aaron Braun, who ran at Adams State, {{tied the}} course record in 2012,with {{a time of}} 21:19.4. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> controversial, since they should have rounded up to 21:20, but {{they gave him a}} tie anyway, because they didn't know how they had rounded, up or down, back in 1995 when Philemon Hanneck set the record, because they didn't have the {{technology}} to determine his time in tenths of a second.|$|R

60|$|Gordon’s {{policies}} were many and very mutable. Viewing the frightful embarrassments that enveloped him, we cannot wonder. Still the same considerateness {{that is always}} so bounteously and so justly extended to the soldier in the field, is no less due in its measure to the councillor in the cabinet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of equity often much neglected both by contemporaries and by history.|$|E

Custom fuel models developed for southern California chamise-dominated chaparral produced the lowest ROS estimates, approximately 10 % of what was observed in the field, and do not seem appropriate for northern California chaparral in our study sites.|$|R

[...] Fear answers, [...] "No, he cannot, unless you get done here extremely soon!"--The Russian Event, full of painful anxiety to Friedrich, was a new Siege of Colberg.

A man can do anything with a woman if he sets about it the right way. I'm not taking this stand because I'm cruel, Cerise, but because I'm desperate.

60|$|It may be {{that all}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of pure {{sociability}} on Mooweesuk's part, for {{it is certainly not}} his season of love-making or of finding a mate. Often, as I have said, three or four cubs will sleep the winter out in the same den; but again you may find two or three old coons in the same tree. Unlike many other animals with regard to their dens, the law of hospitality is strong with the coon, and a solitary old fellow that prefers to den by himself will never refuse to share his winter house with other coons that are driven out of their snug shelter; and this holds true notwithstanding {{the fact that there are}} plenty other hollow trees that seem to belong to the tribe in general, for they are visited freely by every passing coon.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} chapter {{of the first half}} of the book I give what is, I believe, the real secret of this confusion, the secret of what the Eugenists really want. They want to be allowed to find out what they want. Not content with the {{endowment}} of research, they desire the establishment of research; that is the making of it a thing official and compulsory, like education or state insurance; but still it is only research and not discovery. In short, they want a new kind of State Church, which shall be an Established Church of Doubt--instead of Faith. They have no Science of Eugenics at all, but they do really mean that if we will give ourselves up to be vivisected they may very probably have one some day. I point out, in more dignified diction, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> thick.|$|E
