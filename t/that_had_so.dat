5|$|The {{attacks of}} 28 March were a {{continuation}} of the rapid advances <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> shattered the Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to {{the fact that this was}} not a set-piece assault, but merely an attack off the line of march. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal {{indicate}} that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement {{to the south of}} the Central Plaza of GroupA. StructureA-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital {{foothold in the}} steppe transitional zone. Despite the withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> impressed and given pause to the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, 1998, seven {{counties}} in Minnesota were declared federal disaster areas: Brown, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Rice, Cottonwood, Blue Earth and Nobles. The money allotted {{from the federal}} government allowed the affected towns to clean up the damage and begin the rebuilding process. In addition to the federal dollars, the state of Minnesota contributed $27.6million to the cleanup and rebuilding effort, with $1.35million designated specifically for the preservation of the historical buildings in St. Peter. Most of St. Peter's buildings that were on the National Historic Register were damaged, but only one—a French Second Empire school building built in 1871 (St. Peter Central School)—had to be demolished. Three years after the tornado, the City of St. Peter reported that its population had grown by 2%; an unusual feat for a town <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> recently endured a natural disaster.|$|E

Fresedo sought to adapt to these new times, but somehow, this attempt merely detracted from the strength of the fresediano style <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> successfully combined so as successful rhythm and elegance. From this time forward, his orchestrations become slower and he chooses mellifluous singers who even, in some cases, give a certain boleristic air to their versions of his tangos.|$|E
25|$|Just how {{significant}} the strike's implications were becomes apparent {{when considering the}} miner's place in Communist myth-making: he represented an “archetypal proletarian”, a “new man” whose symbolic aura was conferred by his Stakhanovite determination. The idea of the new man particularly caught on in areas dominated by a single industry, like the Jiu Valley, where the working masses could easily be controlled by the party. The uneducated miners, drawn largely from poor rural or socially disadvantaged layers of society, believed in the Communist ideology and discourse, which rang true to them, and awaited {{the arrival of a}} classless society. The miserable conditions in which they actually lived did not match the propaganda, and the disillusioned miners responded forcefully. After the strike, Ceaușescu took to posing as an “honorary miner” or as a national leader flanked by Securitate members dressed up as miners. He had been genuinely shocked that the representatives par excellence of the new man had unexpectedly revolted against the system <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> carefully crafted them. The image of the model miner had come crashing down, and for that reason the strikers were terrorized—they had destroyed a myth that had served not only them and other “new men”, but also Ceaușescu himself.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Robert Dudley entered his new Welsh {{possessions}} there had existed a tenurial chaos {{for more than}} half a century. Some leading local families benefited from this to the detriment of the Crown's revenue. To remedy this situation, and to increase his own income, Dudley effected compositions with the tenants in what Simon Adams has called an [...] "ambitious resolution of a long-standing problem ... without parallel in Elizabeth's reign". All tenants <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far only been copyholders were raised to the status of freeholders in exchange for newly agreed rents. Likewise, all tenants' rights of common were secured as were the boundaries of the commons, thus striking a balance between property rights and protection against enclosure.|$|E
500|$|Each {{production}} was a gamble. The {{aspect of the}} machine plays that posterity knows most about is their economics, as this was what the old prompter Downes most vividly recalled when he wrote his Roscius Anglicanus in 1708.

Ticket prices for these performances would be raised to up to four times normal. Both Psyche and The Tempest actually complained of the production costs in their epilogues, hinting pointedly that the public ought to reward the [...] "poor players" [...] for their risk-taking and for offering splendours <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far been reserved for royal masques: ...|$|E

However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much more than just one kind of plot line ...

500|$|Once again, {{international}} {{opinion of}} the Dutch military campaigns was one of outrage, significantly in both the United Nations and the United States. In January 1949, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding the reinstatement of the Republican government. United States aid specifically earmarked for Dutch Indonesia was immediately cancelled and pressure mounted within the US Congress for all United States aid to be cut off. This included Marshall Plan funds vital for Dutch post-World War II rebuilding <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far totalled $US 1billion. The Netherlands Government had spent an amount equivalent to almost half of this funding their campaigns in Indonesia. That United States aid {{could be used to}} fund [...] "a senile and ineffectual imperialism" [...] encouraged many key voices in the United States – including those amongst the US Republican Party – and from within American churches and NGOs to speak out in support of Indonesian independence.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly favorable, calling it [...] "the only show with any sense of mystery." [...] John Teti of The A.V.

[...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I can appreciate the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E

[...] Clarke culled [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu" [...] from her incipient novel. [...] Greenland {{was so impressed with}} the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Gaiman later said, [...] "It was terrifying {{from my point of view}} to read this first short story <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much assurance...It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata." [...] Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden. Clarke learned of these events when Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 (1996), which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers. She accepted and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997.|$|E
