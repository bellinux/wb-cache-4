5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} collegiate game, against Duke, Farmer played 7 minutes and air balled his only shot. After an early season loss to Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic dropped the Wildcats' record to 23, Sutton noted that Farmer, Sean Sutton, and LaRon Ellis had all missed {{practice}} {{time with the}} flu. After managing just 17 points in the Wildcats' first five games, Farmer scored 10 points in 20 minutes in the team's sixth game against Northwestern State. With 12 seconds {{to go in the}} game and Kentucky trailing 8482, Farmer was whistled for an intentional foul on Northwestern State's Roman Banks while trying to draw a charge on an inbounds play. Banks maintained that Farmer had tugged Banks <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> fallen down, attempting to draw the call, but Farmer and Sutton both denied the alleged chicanery. Banks hit one of two free throws, and Farmer missed a potentially game-tying three-point shot at the buzzer, dropping the Wildcats to 24 on the season. Farmer followed up with a 15-point performance in a win against Western Carolina. In the Kentucky Invitational Tournament, where Kentucky lost its opening round game to Bowling Green before winning the third-place game against Marshall, Farmer scored 12 points in each game.|$|E

2500|$|Believing U-505 to {{be seriously}} damaged, Oblt.z.S. Lange ordered his crew to abandon ship.

With the engines still functioning and the rudder damaged by depth charges, U-505 circled clockwise at approximately [...] Seeing the U-boat turning <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> believing she {{was preparing to}} attack, the commanding officer of Chatelain ordered a single torpedo to be fired at the submarine; the torpedo missed, passing ahead of the now-abandoned U-505.|$|E

2500|$|On one account, {{moments before}} his death, Beethoven was laying upon bed, pale and suffering, {{when a man}} entered. It was fellow {{composer}} Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who was Beethoven's old and only friend, {{and one of his}} contemporaries. Hummel, who had heard of Beethoven's illness, came to him with succor and money. But it was too late; Beethoven was speechless, and a grateful smile was all that he had to bestow upon his friend. Hummel bent <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and,</b> by the aid of an acoustic instrument, enabled Beethoven to hear a few words of his compassion and regret. Beethoven seemed reanimated, his eyes shone, he struggled for utterance, and gasped, [...] "Is it not true, Hummel, that I have some talent after all?". After these words, his eyes grew fixed, his mouth fell open, and he passed away.|$|E
2500|$|She went up {{one story}} {{and stopped in}} between floors. The gentleman started to yell, [...] "What's wrong!" [...] I said, [...] "The {{elevator}} operator wants to kiss you." [...] Shocked, the gentleman said, [...] "But I'm a married man!" [...] The girl said, [...] "I don't mind that." [...] She walked <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he stepped back and said, [...] "You start the elevator." [...] So she started it. She went up to about the fourth floor and stopped it again between floors. She said, [...] "I just have a craving for a kiss." [...] He said, [...] "You go about your business." [...] He wanted that elevator moving, not standing still. She replied, [...] "Well, let's go down {{and start all over}} again," [...] and she began to take the elevator down. He said, [...] "Not down, up!" [...] since he didn't want to go through that all over again.|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 1871, Hickok was {{standing}} off a crowd during a street brawl when Coe fired two shots. Hickok {{ordered him to}} be arrested for firing a pistol within the city limits. Coe claimed that he was shooting at a stray dog, and then suddenly turned his gun on Hickok, who fired first and killed Coe. Hickok {{caught a glimpse of}} someone running <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> quickly fired two more shots in reaction, accidentally shooting and killing Abilene Special Deputy Marshal Mike Williams, who was coming to his aid. This event haunted Hickok for the remainder of his life. There is another account of the Coe shootout: Theophilus Little, the mayor of Abilene and owner of the town's lumber yard, recorded his time in Abilene by writing in a notebook which was ultimately given to the Abilene Historical Society. Writing in 1911, he detailed his admiration of Hickok and included a paragraph on the shooting that differs considerably from the reported account: ...|$|E

2500|$|Other sources {{acting as}} {{examples}} of Gunnhild's sorcery include the story of King Hákon's death in Snorri's Heimskringla, as well as instances concerning Egil in Egil's Saga,and suspicion surrounding the death of Halfdan Haraldsson [...] Heimskringla describes Hákon's ascent to the Norwegian throne after hearing of the cruelties caused by Eirík's rule. Hákon found great support among the Norwegian people, and therefore forced Eirík and Gunnhild to flee to England. Naturally many battles for the throne ensued, which ultimately led to Gunnhild getting blamed for Hákon's death, when an arrow flew towards him in battle piercing into the muscle of his upper arm. According to Heimskringla, it is stated that [...] "through the sorcery of Gunnhildr a kitchen boy wheeled round, crying: 'Make room for the king's slayer!' and let fly the arrow into the group coming <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> wounding the king." [...] Marlene Ciklamini reasons that the unusualness of the mortal wound directs the origin to possible sorcery involved, presumably by Gunnhild.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{political}} decline of Mu'tazilism and {{the victory of}} orthodoxy, Ibn Abi Du'ad came under harsh criticism for his doctrinal beliefs and the prosecution of the mihnah. Sunni writers often {{made no attempt to}} conceal their hostility <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> passed severe judgement on his tenure in office. The trial and flogging of Ahmad ibn Hanbal in 834-5, in which Ibn Abi Du'ad played a major role, was particularly condemned. Ahmad himself is quoted as having remarked that Ibn Abi Du'ad was a [...] "disbeliever of God Almighty (kafirun bi'llah al-'azim)" [...] and [...] "the most ignorant of people in knowledge ('ilm) and theology (kalam)," [...] and later sources portrayed Ahmad as heroically defending the traditionalist cause {{in the face of an}} ignorant bigot. Individuals associated with Ibn Abi Du'ad also occasionally faced discrimination after his death, as when the caliph al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869) cancelled the appointments of eight men as qadis and exiled them to Baghdad upon learning that they had been followers of the former judge.|$|E
2500|$|In summer 909, Liu Shouwen {{launched}} another attack, {{this time}} after sending gifts to persuade Khitan and Tuyuhun tribes {{to fight on}} his side against Liu Shouguang as well. [...] He initially defeated Liu Shouguang at Jisu (雞蘇, in modern Tianjin), but during the initial victory, Liu Shouwen declared to his troops, [...] "Do not kill my brother!" [...] As he did, Liu Shouguang's general Yuan Xingqin, who recognized Liu Shouwen, charged <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> captured him, and subsequently, the battle turned into a rout against the Yichang troops. [...] Liu Shouguang put Liu Shouwen under arrest and headed toward Cang Prefecture. [...] Liu Shouwen's assistants Lü Yan (呂兗) and Sun He (孫鶴) initially supported Liu Shouwen's son Liu Yanzuo as his successor and put up a defense, and the defense held, even after Liu Shouguang took Liu Shouwen {{to the city to}} show the troops that Liu Shouwen had been captured. [...] The food supplies ran out, and the army resorted to slaughtering the weaker residents for food. [...] In spring 910, Liu Yanzuo surrendered, and Liu Shouguang had his son Liu Jiwei (劉繼威) take over Yichang. [...] Liu Shouguang soon after had Liu Shouwen assassinated, then blamed the assassination on the killer and executed the killer.|$|E

60|$|He looked {{round at}} the crowd of faces, {{all of which were}} now turned <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> kindly faces <b>and</b> angry ones, contemptuous eyes and good-natured ones, and some that {{expressed}} both compassion and reproof.|$|R
