50|$|Thermofluor {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in drug screening campaigns.Since thermofluor basically detects high affinity binding sites for small molecules on proteins, it can find hits that bind to active site subsites, cofactor sites, or allosteric binding sites with equal efficacy.The method typically {{requires the use of}} screening compound concentrations at >10x the desired binding threshold. Setting 5 micromolar as a reasonable hit threshold consequently requires a test ligand concentration of 50 to 100micromolar in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well.</b> For most drug compound libraries, where many compounds are not soluble beyond ~100 micromolar, screening multiple compounds is consequently not feasible owing to solubility issues. Thermoflour screens do not require the development of custom screening reagents (e.g. cleavable substrate analogs), do not require any radioactive reagents, and are generally less sensitive to the effects of compounds that are chemically reactive with protein active site residues, and that consequently show up as undesirable hits in enzyme activity screens.|$|E

40|$|We {{constructed}} a small flow chamber in which suboxic medium containing 60 to 120 μM FeCl 2 flowed {{up through a}} sample well into an aerated reservoir, thereby creating an suboxic-oxic interface similar to the physicochemical conditions that exist in natural iron seeps. When microbial mat material from the Marselisborg iron seep that contained up to 109 bacterial cells per cm 3 (D. Emerson and N. P. Revsbech, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 4022 - 4031, 1994) was placed in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well</b> of the chamber, essentially all of the Fe 2 + flowing through <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well</b> was oxidized at rates of up to 1, 200 nmol of Fe 2 + oxidized per h per cm 3 of mat material. The oxidation rates of samples of the mat that were pasteurized prior to inoculation were only about 20 to 50 % of the oxidation rates of unpasteurized samples. Sodium azide also significantly inhibited oxidation. These results suggest that at least 50 % and up to 80 % of the Fe oxidation in the chamber were actively mediated by the microbes in the mat. It also appeared that Fe stimulated {{the growth of the}} community since chambers fed with FeCl 2 accumulated masses of either filamentous or particulate growth, both in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well</b> and attached to the walls of the chamber. Control chambers that did not receive FeCl 2 showed no sign of such growth. Furthermore, after 4 to 5 days the chambers fed with FeCl 2 contained 35 to 75 % more protein than chambers not supplemented with FeCl 2. Leptothrix ochracea and, to a lesser extent, Gallionella spp. were responsible for the filamentous growth, and the sheaths and stalks, respectively, of these two organisms harbored large numbers of Fe-encrusted, nonappendaged unicellular bacteria. In chambers where particulate growth predominated, the unicellular bacteria alone appeared to be the primary agents of iron oxidation. These results provide the first clear evidence that the “iron bacteria” commonly found associated with neutral-pH iron seeps are responsible for most of the iron oxidation and that the presence of ferrous iron appears to stimulate the growth of these organisms...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was based on}} the hypothesis {{that one of the most}} serious environmental problems in Los Altos de Jalisco is the great number of drinking water sources contaminated with toxic elements. This hypothesis was stated due to the following: (1) high prevalence of dental fluorosis; (2) high temperature in tap water of numerous homes; and (3) a large number of towns are located in a region characterized by an intense hydrothermal activity. The main objectives of this research were: (1) to determine the concentration of fluoride and other possible pollutants in drinking water supplies; (2) to estimate the exposure dose to toxic elements detected in drinking water; and (3) to evaluate the potential human health risk associated with the ingestion of contaminated drinking water. ^ More than 130 public water <b>wells</b> were <b>sampled</b> and analyzed to determine fluoride and other potentially toxic elements. Fluoride, arsenic and selenium were the toxic elements that occurred in most of <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>wells.</b> Fluoride was determined using the ion-selective electrochemical method and the other elements were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The results showed that more than 46 % of <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>wells</b> have a fluoride concentration greater than 1. 5 mg/L, which is the Mexican drinking water standard. At least 34 % of the wells exceeded the guideline value of 25 μg/L for arsenic, and more than 95 % of <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>wells</b> have selenium concentrations higher than 10 μg/L, which is the World Health Organization guideline value. ^ Exposure doses to fluoride, arsenic and selenium, recommended by international organizations are 0. 05 mg/kg/d, 2. 14 μg/kg/d, and 0. 87 – 1. 70 μg/kg/d, respectively. Nevertheless, the mean estimated exposure doses to fluoride were 0. 92, 0. 23, and 0. 12 mg/kg/d for babies, children and adults, respectively. For arsenic, the values were 4. 4, 2. 9, and 1. 5 μg/kg/d, respectively. In the case of selenium, the calculated values were 6. 7, 5. 6, and 3. 5 μg/kg/d. These values suggest that babies are the most exposed to the toxic elements. The seed data corroborate the proposed hypothesis. The data also suggest that, besides dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis and bone fractures could be a serious problem of public health at Los Altos de Jalisco. Skin diseases, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular problems, and neurological damages, could be caused by the high arsenic concentrations found in <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>wells.</b> Nevertheless, estimated exposure doses to selenium indicated that the risks to the occurrence of selenosis are minimal. Health problems could be reduced by improving the enforcement of the law, and developing a risk communication program promoting healthy nutritional practices addressed to mitigate drinking water toxicity. Epidemiological studies should be conducted to determine the prevalence of health problems caused by high levels of toxic elements present in drinking water. ...|$|R

Objectives: In the present study, we determined the prevalence and risk factors of rotavirus infection among children younger than age 5 years with or without diarrhoea in Calabar, Nigeria, using a rapid point-of-care test. Methods: Two hundred infants younger than age 5 years presenting with acute gastroenteritis and a control group of 200 infants without diarrhoea were tested for rotavirus. Each stool sample was homogenised in an extraction buffer and the supernatant added into <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well</b> of the Rida Quick rotavirus test cassette and allowed to run for 5 minutes at room temperature. When both the control band and test band were visible on the test cassette a positive result was recorded, whereas when only the control band was visible a negative results was recorded. Results: Rotavirus was detected in 25 (12. 5 %) of children with diarrhoea and in no children without diarrhoea. Our results demonstrated that children who were exclusively breast-fed by their mothers were not infected with rotavirus and that 92 % of the infants infected with rotavirus experienced vomiting. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that asymptomatic rotavirus infection is rare and that rotavirus is commonly detected in stool samples of children suffering from diarrhoea with concomitant vomiting.

40|$|The {{one step}} strip test {{described}} is a competitive immunoassay {{in which the}} detector reagent consists of colloidal gold particles coated with affinity purified polyclonal anti-sulfadimidine (SDD) antibodies.

In the test procedure, 150 µl (four drops) of a liquid sample (buffer, urine or milk) are brought into <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well</b> of the test device and allowed to migrate over the membrane. The more analyte present in the sample, the more effectively it will compete with the SDD immobilised on the membrane for binding to the limited amount of antibodies of the detector reagent.

40|$|Contactless {{atmospheric}} pressure ionization (C-API) method has been recently developed for mass spectrometric analysis. A tapered capillary {{is used as}} both the sampling tube and spray emitter in C-API. No electric contact is required on the capillary tip during C-API mass spectrometric analysis. The simple design of the ionization method enables the automation of the C-API sampling system. In this study, we propose an automatic C-API sampling system consisting of a capillary (∼ 1 cm), an aluminium sample holder, and a movable XY stage for the mass spectrometric analysis of organics and biomolecules. The aluminium sample holder {{is controlled by the}} movable XY stage. The outlet of the C-API capillary is placed in front of the orifice of a mass spectrometer, whereas <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well</b> on the sample holder is moved underneath the capillary inlet. The sample droplet on the well can be readily infused into the C-API capillary through capillary action. When the sample solution reaches the capillary outlet, the sample spray is readily formed in the proximity of the mass spectrometer applied with a high electric field. The gas phase ions generated from the spray can be readily monitored by the mass spectrometer. We demonstrate that six samples can be analyzed in sequence within 3. 5 min using this automatic C-API MS setup. Furthermore, the well containing the rinsing solvent is alternately arranged between the sample wells. Therefore, the C-API capillary could be readily flushed between runs. No carryover problems are observed during the analyses. The sample volume required for the C-API MS analysis is minimal, with less than 1 nL of the sample solution being sufficient for analysis. The feasibility of using this setup for quantitative analysis is also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|A {{membrane}} chemiluminescent assay {{was developed}} for rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus. This one step liquid phase immuno-recognition procedure was achieved by incubating samples containing S. aureus cells with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled monoclonal antibody, followed by recovery of the cells on a membrane, and measurement of the HRP catalyzed chemiluminescent signal on the membrane surface with a luminometer. Optimum pH, antibody binding temperature and time, and sensitivity of the assay were determined. The optimum pH for the chemiluminescent reaction was at 8. 5. No {{significant difference was found}} between ambient temperature (22 °C– 25 °C) and 37 °C incubation. Binding time of 60 min had a higher signal than 10 or 20 min. Chemiluminescent signal due to non-specific binding was tested with various membrane materials, and Durapore® polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) had the lowest background signal. Different chemiluminescent reagents were studied to achieve the highest sensitivity combined with a low reagent background. SuperSignal® LBA produced a significantly higher signal output than Luminol/Enhencer and LumiGLOTM reagents. Two different diameter membranes, 25 mm and 13 mm, were first tested in a luminometer tube format assay. A hand-operated syringe filtration unit was used to capture cells and the membrane was then transferred to a luminometer tube for the chemiluminescent reaction. The sensitivity of the immunoassay was approximately 104 CFU/ml of S. aureus. Efforts had been made to refine the immunoassay into a simple, sensitive and rapid chemiluminescent fiber optic biosensor. An improved system utilized a simple but efficient microwell plate vacuum filtration unit with an 8 mm membrane sealed at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>well.</b> The sample was concentrated on the membrane and positioned directly in front of a fiber optic light guide to effectively collect and transmit the signal to the luminometer. Labeling S. aureus in solution proved to be much more effective than on the membrane surface. Using the microwell plate filtration system resulted in less sample handling, better reproducibility, and dramatically reduced assay time. The average variability for 25 mm and 13 mm assays were 24. 7 % and 13. 3 %, while the microwell plate assay reduced this to only 4. 0 %. The ability of the fiber optic probe to effectively collect the signal meant the sensitivity of the assay was not compromised with smaller membrane and sample size. The sensitivity of the biosensor was 3. 8 × 104 CFU/ml, adequate to detect the organism at concentrations lower than the level that could result in food poisoning. The biosensor demonstrated specificity to S. aureus cells in the presence of sample food materials as well as in buffer. ...|$|E
