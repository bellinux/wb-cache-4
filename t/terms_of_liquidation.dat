Although investment in [...] "Collectibles" [...] using IRAs and Qualified Plans is not allowed, there is a carve-out allowing for investment in certain coins, as well as bullion meeting certain fineness requirements. There are more advantages to holding gold coins as opposed to bars in a gold IRA in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidation.</b> Gold bars {{are more difficult to}} sell due to their higher price and easier ability to be counterfeited, as well as being more difficult to deliver due to their heaviness and the amount of security required during transport. There are currently a variety of {{precious metals}} that meet the minimum purity requirements that are acceptable for inclusion into a gold IRA account. Some gold IRA companies argue inclusion of certain coins in a precious metals IRA; however, several of those companies have been investigated by the government for misleading customers and aggressively selling numismatic coins over gold bullion. Numismatic coins pay the gold company higher commissions, but bullion bars more directly reflect the spot price of the precious metal.|$|E

As in Lorenzoni andWalentin (2007) optimal financial contracts under limited enforcement imply that to obtain external finance firms have to post collateral in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidation</b> value of the firm. In contrast to earlier real one-sector models, we show that a model {{with this type of}} 'collateral constraint' generates an increase in stock prices in response to positive news about future productivity, {{as well as the other}} properties of an expectation driven business cycle, that is, an increase in consumption, investment and hours. The positive stock price response is in line with Beaudry and Portier's (2006) empirical results and the emerging standard view of expectation driven booms...|$|E
