40|$|Objective/Objectives: {{depression}} {{is common in}} dementia causing considerable distress, and other negative impacts. Treating it is a clinical priority but the evidence base is sparse and equivocal. This trail aimed to determine clinical effectiveness of sertraline and mirtazapine in reducing depression 13 weeks post-randomisation compared with placebo Design: multi-centre parallel group double-blind placebo-controlled RCT of the clinical effectiveness of sertraline and mirtazapine with 13 and 39 week follow up. Setting: from nine English old age psychiatry services Participants: a pragmatic trial, eligibility: probable or possible Alzheimer's Disease, depression (4 + weeks), and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) score of 8 +. Exclusions: clinically too critical (eg suicide risk); contra-indication to medication; taking antidepressants; in another trial; and having no carer Interventions: (1) Sertraline, (2) mirtazapine, and (3) placebo, all with normal care. Target doses: 150 mg sertraline or 45 mg mirtazapine daily Main outcome measures: Outcome – CSDD score. Randomisation - Allocated 1 : 1 : 1 through Trials Unit, independently of trial team. Stratified block randomisation by centre with randomly varying block sizes; computer-generated randomisation. Blinding - Double-blind, medication and placebo identical for each antidepressant. Referring clinicians, research workers, participants and pharmacies were blind. Statisticians blind until analyses completed. Results: Numbers randomised - 326 participants randomised (111 placebo, 107 sertraline, 108 mirtazapine). Outcome - Differences in CSDD at 13 weeks from an adjusted linear mixed model: mean difference (95 %CI) placebo/sertraline 1. 17 (- 0. 23 to 2. 78, p= 0. 102); placebo/mirtazapine 0. 01 (- 1. 37 to 1. 38, p= 0. 991); and mirtazapine/sertraline 1. 16 (- 0. 27 to 2. 60, p= 0. 112). Harms - Placebo group had fewer adverse reactions (29 / 111, 26 %) than sertraline (46 / 107, 43 %) or mirtazapine (44 / 108, 41 %; p= 0. 017); 39 week mortality equal, five deaths in each group. Conclusion/Conclusions: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> with negative findings but important clinical implications. The {{data suggest that the}} antidepressants tested, given with normal care, are not clinically effective (compared with placebo) for clinically significant depression in Alzheimer’s disease. This implies a need to change current practice of antidepressants being the first line treatment of depression in Alzheimer’s disease.

40|$|Despite {{its wide}} and unfortunate neglect (if {{it is even}} noticed at all), {{the fact that the}} date of Socrates 2 ̆ 7 trial coincided with Athens 2 ̆ 7 s annual {{sacrificial}} festival (Thargelia) is of paramount significance for an interpretation not only of Plato 2 ̆ 7 s Apology but also of the historical trial itself. The argument presented here is that Socrates 2 ̆ 7 prosecution and execution <b>was,</b> quite so, <b>an</b> expression of a sacrificial logic, which holds, mistakenly, that a single individual can be held responsible for a social crisis. The sacrificial narrative, then [...] a narrative implicitly put into play by that ominous trial date [...] would have located Socrates as the single source of the concomitant Athenian crises at play in the devastating aftermath of the Peloponnesian war. In fact, Plato 2 ̆ 7 s Apology can be, and perhaps must <b>be,</b> read as <b>an</b> elaboration on this sacrificial narrative. Yet, Plato turns the narrative on its head; by casting Socrates not only as the archetypal, 2 ̆ 2 polluted 2 ̆ 2 pharmakos but also as the willing scapegoat, Plato has Socrates enact a deadly confrontation between Socratic and Athenian values.
