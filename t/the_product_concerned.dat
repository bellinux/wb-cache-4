By using this method no lipase could be detected in ripened Gouda cheese, made of raw milk. Furthermore, no potential lipolytic activity was measured in ripened danish blue cheese, but it was in ripened Camembert and Brie, all of these cheeses being made of pasteurized milk.

Several vendors alongside an original equipment manufacturer are available in provision of remanufacturing service. Each has its own queue. The stream of the product returns follow a stochastic process. A central controller is employed to decide to which vendor an incoming product is sent to avoid excessive queues in front of some vendors and idle servers in the others. We develop models and index-based heuristics to support the dynamic routing decisions so as to minimize the overall recovering costs. <b>The</b> <b>product</b> <b>concerned</b> exemplifies a short-life cycle due to, for example, technology advance. Long delay during the remanufacturing process will render a substantial deterioration of reselling prices.

Both theoretical and simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the Restless Bandit approach deployed to the dynamic routing of product returns among multiple vendors...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} is proposed to functionally decompose an already existing integrated mechanical jet engine subsystem. An integrated sub {{system is a}} system where the same design object satisfies multiple functions: which is typically the case in aircraft engine sub systems and components. A generic decomposition method will allow implementation and use in automated design systems and will function {{as a means to}} build experiences into platforms. Using the procedure, an enhanced function-means tree (E F-M tree) consisting of functional requirements, means to satisfy the requirements and constraints was created for the integrated jet engine component. The E F-M tree is then used to generate a hierarchy of configurable components (CCs). A configurable component (CC) is a stand-alone conceptual object that contains the functional requirement, means to satisfy the requirement (or design solution) and constraints at a certain level of the E F-M tree. A specific CC hierarchy configuration results in the description of <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>concerned.</b> The usage of the CC hierarchy as design documentation as well as a template to derive other designs from is demonstrated. Finally limitations of describing product functional requirements using CC method and recommendations for further development of the method are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In this study, Heckler & Childers' (1992) {{two-dimensional}} {{conceptualization of}} incongruity is employed {{and related to}} the different schemas that consumers use in ad processing. Consumers can relate advertising to expectations about ads for <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>concerned</b> from the ad schema or to brand-related expectations from the brand schema. If an ad is incongruent with the brand schema, consumer responses to incongruity do not only reflect expectancy of the ad, but also involve determining relevancy to the brand, consistent with the two-dimensional conceptualization of incongruity. However, if an ad is incongruent with the ad schema consumers will only react to the expectancy dimension of incongruity. Therefore, {{these two types of}} incongruity have different consequences in terms of consumer evaluation, processing and categorization. We find that incongruity with the ad schema mainly has affective consequences. Ads that are incongruent with the ad schema lead to more arousal and consequently more favorable ad evaluations than ads that are congruent with the ad schema. Incongruity with the brand schema has predominantly cognitive consequences. Ads that are incongruent with the brand schema lead to more extensive processing than ads that are congruent with the brand schema. Brand beliefs and categorization change as a result of incongruent advertising information. experiments;information processing;Advertising;congruency;schema theory...|$|E

40|$|Odd pricing {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of pricing goods just below the nearest round figure, for example, $ 9. 99 instead of $ 10. 00, or $ 1, 995 instead of $ 2, 000, to produce higher than expected demand at the price level concerned. Although the practice of odd pricing is prevalent in retailing, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence to verify the effectiveness of odd pricing as a strategy to increase demand. This thesis reports the findings of a study designed to test the assumption that odd pricing produces higher than expected demand resulting in a "kinked" demand curve. That is, a demand curve which is inconsistent with the traditional law of demand. Purchase probabilities, used to measure estimated demand for six household products at four price levels, were obtained from a sample of 300 consumers. For each product, showcards featuring two prices, one slightly above an even price point and one slightly below the same price point, were presented to all 300 consumers. These prices served the purpose of creating top and bottom "anchor" points of the demand curve for <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>concerned.</b> The sample was further divided into three subsamples of 100 consumers who each viewed either an appropriate even or odd "test" price. This process produced 300 purchase probabilities for each top and bottom "anchor" price and 100 purchase probabilities for each even and odd "test" price, for each of the six products. A demand curve for each product was then produced to examine whether greater than expected demand had occurred at the odd price points. A noticeable trend of greater than expected demand at odd price points occurred for all products tested. This finding offers strong support for the odd pricing assumption. In particular, greater than expected demand for grocery items occurred in response to odd prices. No difference was detected between the odd pricing effect for 95 and 99 cent endings, indicating that, where practical, 99 cent endings achieve the highest gross profit margin obtainable from pricing below the nearest round figure...|$|E
