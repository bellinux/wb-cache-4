We varied {{the degree to which}} it was possible to prepare for the response signal in a choice reaction time (RT) task by employing either a short (500 ms) or a long (2500 ms) foreperiod in separate blocks of trials. <b>Transcranial</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>stimulations</b> were delivered during these foreperiods in order to study modulations in both the size {{of the motor}} evoked potential (MEP) and the duration of the silent period (SP) in tonically activated response agonists. Motor evoked potential area and silent period duration were assumed to reflect, respectively, the excitability of the cortico-spinal pathway and the recruitment of inhibitory cortical interneurons. Shorter reaction times were observed with the shorter foreperiod, indicating that a better level of preparation was attained for the short foreperiod. Silent period duration decreased as time elapsed during the foreperiod and this decrement was more pronounced for the short foreperiod. This result suggests that time preparation is accompanied by a removal of intracortical inhibition, resulting in an activation. Motor evoked potential area decreased {{over the course of the}} short foreperiod, but not over the long foreperiod, revealing that time preparation involves the inhibition of the cortico-spinal pathway.

Following this registration, the physician can follow the change in coil position in real-time through the visualization interface and adjust the coil position to the desired anatomical location.

To address this issue, we investigated the tDCS after-effects on interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between the primary motor cortices (M 1) in healthy humans. Three types of tDCS electrode montage were tested on separate days; anodal tDCS over the right M 1, cathodal tDCS over the left M 1, bilateral tDCS with anode over the right M 1 and cathode over the left M 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the simultaneous application of slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation enhances the neuroplastic response to <b>transcranial</b> <b>magnetic</b> theta burst <b>stimulation.</b> Motor evoked potential amplitude was assessed at baseline and at regular intervals up to 60 min following continuous theta burst stimulation, slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation, and the simultaneous application of these paradigms. In addition, the electroencephalographic power spectra of slow and fast delta, and theta frequency bands recorded over the motor cortex were analyzed prior to and up to 5 min following each intervention. There was longer-lasting motor evoked potential suppression following the simultaneous application of continuous theta burst stimulation and slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation compared with when continuous theta burst stimulation was applied alone. Slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation applied alone did not modulate the motor evoked potential amplitude. No significant changes in spectral power were observed following slow-oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation.

Both during observation and execution, differential force encoding tended to gradually increase from the grasping phase until the late lift phase. Surprisingly, however, during observation, force encoding was already present at the early reach phase: a time point at which no visual cues on the object's weight were available to the observer. As the observer was aware that the same weight condition was presented repeatedly, this finding may indicate that prior predictions concerning the upcoming weight condition are reflected by M 1 excitability.

40|$|Migraine is a {{disorder}} in which {{central nervous system}} (CNS) dysfunction might play a pivotal role. As there are no consistent structural disturbances, clinical neurophysiology methods seem particularly suited to study its pathophysiology. This chapter will focus on a review of neurophysiological studies that have provided an insight into migraine pathogenesis. The results are in part contradictory, which {{may be due to}} the methodology, patient selection or timing of study. Nonetheless, quantitative electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings during migraine attacks provide strong, though indirect, evidence favouring the occurrence of spreading cortical depression during attacks of migraine with, and possibly without, aura. Evoked cortical potential and nociceptive blink reflex studies demonstrate that lack of habituation during repetitive stimulation is a reproducible CNS dysfunction interictally in both migraine with and without aura. <b>Transcranial</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>stimulations</b> show excitability changes of the visual cortex.

40|$|Somatosensory inputs to {{the primary}} sensory cortex (S 1) after median nerve {{stimulation}} include temporally overlapping parallel processing, as reflected by standard low-frequency somatosensory-evoked potentials (LF-SEPs) and high-frequency SEPs (HF-SEPs), the latter being more sensitive to arousal and to other rapid adaptive changes. Experimental data suggest that cortical HF-SEPs are formed by two successive pre- and postsynaptic components, respectively, generated in the terminal part of thalamo-cortical radiation (early burst) and in specialized neuronal pools within S 1 (later burst). In eight healthy subjects, slow (1 Hz) or rapid (10 Hz) repetitive <b>transcranial</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>stimulations</b> (rTMS), which are known to induce opposite changes on cortical excitability, applied on S 1 did not modify LF-SEPs, while HF-SEPs showed a series of dissociate changes in the early and later high-frequency burst, moreover occurring with a different time-course. Slow rTMS caused an immediate and lasting decrease of the later burst activity, coupled with an immediate increase of the earlier part of the burst, suggesting that inhibition of cortical excitability triggered opposite, compensatory effects at subcortical levels; rapid rTMS induced a delayed increase of later HF-SEPs, leaving unaltered the earlier subcortical burst. Findings causally demonstrate that LF- and HF-SEPs reflect two distinct functional pathways for somatosensory input processing, and that early and late high-frequency burst do actually reflect the activity of different generators, as suggested by experimental data.
