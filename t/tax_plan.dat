5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his <b>tax</b> <b>plan.</b> Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a <b>tax</b> <b>plan</b> to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

25|$|During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney said {{he would}} seek income tax law reforms that he said would help lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. Among the series of tax changes he proposed were: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20 percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15 percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 percent to 25 percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and reining in tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, so that his <b>tax</b> <b>plan</b> would not raise federal deficits.

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>planning</b> by firms is {{a highly}} {{significant}} activity. After audit fees, tax related services are the largest source of fee income for UK accounting firms. When viewed {{in terms of its}} impact, <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> is the major source of the corporation tax gap amongst large firms (HMRC, 2010). Although traditionally <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> has been viewed as benefiting shareholders via increased after tax earnings, more recently the underlying motivation has been questioned. Desai and Dharmapala (2006) argue that when an information asymmetry exists between managers and shareholders with respect to <b>tax</b> <b>planning,</b> it can facilitate managers acting in their own interests resulting in a negative association between <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> and firm value. Using a sample of UK quoted firms from 2005 - 2007 and data drawn from International Accounting Standard 12 Income Taxes (IASB, 2010) Effective Tax Rate (ETR) reconciliations, this paper reports such a negative relationship. Further, the relationship is robust to the inclusion of corporate governance measures which could be expected to moderate the potential implications of a tax related shareholder-manager information asymmetry. An innovation of this paper is in using the ETR reconciliations to examine sub-categories of <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> activities.

[...] The big confrontation came after the <b>tax</b> <b>plan</b> was approved and after Dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms. [...] Kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an op-ed piece in The New York Times, which enraged Dole. Reagan supported the reforms at Dole's request, causing Kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act, which eventually passed in 1982. At the 1984 Republican National Convention, Kemp, along with allies such as Gingrich and Lott, added a plank to the party platform that put President Reagan on record as ruling out tax increases. Gingrich called this action [...] "Dole proofing" [...] the platform, and the plank passed over Dole's opposition. Then, in 1985, Dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the senate with appendectomy patient Pete Wilson casting the tying vote and Vice President Bush casting the deciding vote. In meetings with the president that excluded Dole, Kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial Social Security cutbacks.

500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans.
