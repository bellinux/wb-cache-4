Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess cutaneous manifestations of topical corcticosteroid abuse on the face and to analyse various factors contributing to the same. Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients with facial dermatoses using <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> for a minimum period of 1 month attending the outpatient department from a period of January 2013 to September 2014 were enrolled for the study.

50|$|The obvious {{priority}} is immediate discontinuation of any further <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> use. Protection {{and support of}} the impaired skin barrier is another priority. Eliminating harsh skin regimens or products will be necessary to minimize potential for further purpura or trauma, skin sensitivity, and potential infection. Steroid Atrophy is often permanent, though if caught soon enough and the <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> discontinued in time, the degree of damage may be arrested or slightly improve. However, while the accompanying Telangectasias may improve marginally, the Striae is permanent and irreversible.|$|E

40|$|Background: Misuse of <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> is a {{widespread}} phenomenon among young people in India, especially women. The practice is associated with significant adverse effects and poor awareness of these effects among the general public. Aim: This {{study was conducted to}} examine the misuse and adverse effects of <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> among the people in Bastar region in Chhattisgarh state of India. Materials and Methods: Data collected from patients presenting with {{at least one of the}} adverse effects of <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> as the chief complaint, from November 2010 to October 2011. Results: Out of the 6723 new patients, 379 (5. 63 %) had presented with misuse and adverse effects of <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids,</b> of whom 78. 89 % were females. More than 65 % of the patients were in the age group 10 - 29 years. The main reason for using the <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> was to lighten skin colour and treat melasma and suntan. Acne (37. 99 %) and telangiectasia (18. 99 %) were the most common adverse effects noted. Conclusions: Misuse of <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> has a huge impact on dermatological practice, leading to a significant proportion of visits to the dermatologist.

40|$|<b>Topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> may be {{indicated}} in pregnant women with skin conditions, but their safety in pregnancy is unclear. We used the UK General Practice Research Database {{to conduct a}} population-based cohort study to investigate whether maternal exposure to <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> results in adverse pregnancy outcomes. We identified 35, 503 pregnant women prescribed <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> {{during the period from}} 85 days before last menstrual period (LMP) to delivery or fetal death and 48, 630 unexposed women. We found no associations of maternal exposure to <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> with orofacial cleft (and its two subtypes, i. e., cleft lip ± palate (CLP) and cleft palate alone (CP)), preterm delivery, and fetal death (including miscarriage and stillbirth). The findings were similar when excluding exposure before LMP.

50|$|Tinea incognito is a fungal {{infection}} (mycosis) {{of the skin}} caused {{by the presence of}} a topical immunosuppressive agent.

40|$|Aim: Oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) is a chronic {{mucocutaneous}} disease with an immunological etiology. This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the effect of selenium combined with Vitamins A, C & E (Selenium-ACE) in the treatment of erosive-ulcerative OLP as an adjunctive to <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> plus antifungal agent. Subjects and Methods: Thirty patients with a confirmed clinical and histopathologic diagnosis of OLP participated in this clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated into one of three groups and treated as follows: (I) <b>Topical</b> <b>corticosteroids,</b> (II) <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> plus antifungal, and (III) SE-ACE combined with <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> plus antifungal. The patients were followed for 6 weeks. The pain and severity of the lesions were recorded at the initial and follow-up visits. All recorded data were analyzed using paired t-test and ANOVA test. A P ≤ 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The experimental groups showed a marked reduction in pain sensation and size of lesions, particularly in the final follow-up period, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the first two Groups I and II. However, healing of lesions and improvement of pain sensation was effective in Group III since a significant difference was found favoring Group III over both Groups I and II. Conclusion: No significant difference was found in treating erosive-ulcerative lesions of OLP by <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> alone or combined with antifungal. However, when using SE-ACE in combination with <b>topical</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> plus antifungal, this approach may be effective in managing ulcerative lesions of OLP; but more research with a larger sample size and a longer evaluation period may be recommended...|$|R
