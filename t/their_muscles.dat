5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. <b>Their</b> <b>muscles</b> are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than <b>their</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats a minute, and blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in <b>their</b> <b>muscles.</b> During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E

50|$|From above, {{people can}} {{considerably}} increase their strength without increasing {{the size of}} <b>their</b> <b>muscle,</b> because the body becomes more efficient at muscle recruitment and firing synchronization.|$|R
50|$|The {{patients}} {{of this disease}} exhibit hypertrophic phenotype in <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> tissues. Myostatin target genes {{are found to be}} downregulated while bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target genes display both upregulated and downregulated genotypes.|$|R
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
25|$|Professional {{athletes have}} been {{documented}} using sildenafil, believing the opening of their blood vessels will enrich <b>their</b> <b>muscles.</b> In turn, they believe it will enhance their performances.|$|E
25|$|The muscles {{acting on}} the thumb {{can be divided into}} two groups: The {{extrinsic}} hand muscles, with their muscle bellies located in the forearm, and the intrinsic hand muscles, with <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> bellies located in the hand proper.|$|E
50|$|In {{patients}} with ALS, {{it has been}} shown that distal motor latencies and slowing of conduction velocity worsened as the severity of <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> weakness increased. Both symptoms are consistent with the axonal degeneration occurring in ALS patients.|$|R
50|$|Treadmills {{were invented}} in 1818 by an English {{engineer}} named Sir William Cubitt, {{son of a}} miller. Noting idle prisoners at Bury St Edmundsgaol, he proposed using <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> power to both cure their idleness and produce useful work.|$|R
50|$|Gallamine is a trisquaternary ether {{with three}} ethonium heads {{attached}} to a phenyl ring through an ether linkage. Many other different structures {{have been used for}} <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxant effect such as alcuronium (alloferin), anatruxonium, diadonium, fazadinium (AH8165) and tropeinium.|$|R
25|$|Birds lack a diaphragm, and {{therefore}} use their intercostal and abdominal muscles {{to expand and}} contract their entire thoraco-abdominal cavities, thus rhythmically changing the volumes of all their air sacs in unison (illustration on the right). The active phase of respiration in birds is exhalation, requiring contraction of <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> of respiration. Relaxation of these muscles causes inhalation.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{tetraplegia}} (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are {{the least}} {{likely to be able to}} walk, or if they can, to want to walk, because <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement.|$|E
25|$|Just as athletes {{begin to}} {{conserve}} their remaining strength when <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> begin to tire, so do self-controllers {{when some of}} their self-regulatory resources have been expended. The severity of behavioral impairment during depletion depends in part on whether the person expects further challenges and demands. When people expect to have to exert self-control later, they will curtail current performance more severely than if no such demands are anticipated.|$|E
50|$|They are {{innervated by}} gamma motor neurons and beta motor neurons. It {{is by the}} sensory {{information}} from these two intrafusal fiber types that an individual is able to judge the position of <b>their</b> <b>muscle,</b> and {{the rate at which}} it is changing.|$|R

[...] These patients do not always show the typical nemaline bodies in <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> cells. The only abnormality they show is an abnormal distribution of muscle fibers.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{tolerate}} the constant heat loss in the water, sea turtles {{have the ability to}} shunt blood away from tissues that are tolerant of low oxygen levels toward the heart, brain, and central nervous system. Other mechanisms include basking on warm beaches and producing heat through their activity and movements of <b>their</b> <b>muscles.</b> In the winter months, turtles living at higher latitudes can hibernate for a short period in the mud.|$|E
25|$|Animal aerial {{locomotion}} can {{be divided}} into two categories—powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces. Animals using unpowered aerial locomotion cannot maintain altitude and speed due to unopposed drag, while animals using powered flight can maintain steady, level flight as long as <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> are capable of doing so.|$|E
25|$|I can't quite {{root for}} Lieberman {{to lose his}} primary. What's holding me back is that the anti-Lieberman {{campaign}} has come to stand for much more than Lieberman's sins. It's a test of strength for {{the new breed of}} left-wing activists who are flexing <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> within the party. These are exactly the sorts of fanatics who tore the party apart in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They think in simple slogans and refuse to tolerate any ideological dissent.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt {{specific}} choice {{points in}} the periphery, subsets of motor axons defasciculate from other axons in the motor nerves and steer into <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> target regions. Using a large-scale genetic screen in Drosophila, we identified the sidestep (side) gene as essential for motor axons to leave the motor nerves and enter <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> targets. side encodes a target-derived transmembrane protein (Side) that is a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Side is expressed on embryonic muscles during the period when motor axons leave their nerves and extend onto these muscles. In side mutant embryos, motor axons fail to extend onto muscles and instead continue to extend along their motor nerves. Ectopic expression of Side results in extensive and prolonged motor axon contact with inappropriate tissues expressing Side...|$|R

50|$|Some {{patients}} {{do not require}} treatment to manage the symptoms of paramyotonia congenita. Others, however, require treatment for <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> stiffness and often find mexiletine to be helpful. Others have found acetazolamide to be helpful as well. Avoidance of myotonia triggering events is also an effective method of mytonia prevention.|$|R
25|$|Most phylogenetically {{advanced}} insects {{have two}} pairs of wings located on {{the second and third}} thoracic segments. Insects are the only invertebrates to have developed flight capability, and this has played an important part in their success. Insect flight is not very well understood, relying heavily on turbulent aerodynamic effects. The primitive insect groups use muscles that act directly on the wing structure. The more advanced groups making up the Neoptera have foldable wings, and <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> act on the thorax wall and power the wings indirectly. These muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.|$|E
25|$|Several {{recurring}} themes {{can be seen}} within Anger's cinematic work. One of {{the most}} notable of these is homoeroticism; this was first seen in Fireworks (1947), which was based around Anger's own homosexual awakening, and featured various navy officers flexing <b>their</b> <b>muscles,</b> and a white liquid (often thought of as symbolising semen), pouring over the protagonist's body. Similar homoerotic imagery is found in Scorpio Rising (1963), which stars a muscled, topless, leather-clad biker, and Kustom Kar Kommandos (1965), where a young man sensually polishes a car, with close up shots of his tight-fitting jeans and crotch. Images of naked men also appear in Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969), where they are eventually filmed wrestling, and in Anger Sees Red (2004), in which a muscled, topless man performs press-ups.|$|E
25|$|This complex apparatus, {{including}} the barbs on the sting, {{is thought to}} have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of Apis cerana japonica, defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. Asian giant hornet) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level ("balling"). Previously, heat alone was thought to be responsible for killing intruding wasps, but recent experiments have demonstrated the increased temperature in combination with increased carbon dioxide levels within the ball produce the lethal effect. This phenomenon is also used to kill a queen perceived as intruding or defective, an action known to beekeepers as 'balling the queen', named for the ball of bees formed.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|R

"We will be {{monitoring}} {{this case}} closely {{as it is}} too early to say if this is part of a broader strategy on prevention of Internet gambling in the US or if it is the Department of Justice flexing <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> and trying to influence legislation," [...] said Greg Harris, an analyst at Cannacord Capital.|$|R
40|$|International audienceModel {{organisms are}} vital to our {{understanding}} of human muscle biology and disease. The potential of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster and the zebrafish, Danio rerio, as model genetic organisms for the study of human muscle disease is discussed by examining <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> biology, muscle genetics and development. The powerful genetic tools available with each organism are outlined. It is concluded that these organisms have already demonstrated potential in facilitating the study of muscle disease and in screening for therapeutic agents...|$|R
25|$|Biofeedback {{therapy for}} facial synkinesis aims to {{increase}} the patient’s awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for proprioceptive feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for proprioceptive feedback). Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of <b>their</b> <b>muscles.</b> The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer {{in the form of}} waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction. The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction. Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The season it {{all came}} {{together}} for the Runnin’ Rebels was 1989–90. Future NBA star Larry Johnson transferred from Odessa College, joining Greg Anthony, Stacey Augmon, David Butler and Anderson Hunt. The Rebels began the season ranked No. 1 in almost every poll and rolled through the competition. UNLV suffered a surprising loss at New Mexico State and finished the season as co–champions of the Big West Conference. However, Johnson and Co. flexed <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> in the Big West Tournament, running away with the title and the No. 1 seed in the West Region. In NCAA Tournament play, the Rebels toughest game came {{in the third round}} at Oakland, Calif., when Ball State hung tough before falling 69–67. UNLV also ended Loyola Marymount’s Cinderella season with a 131–101 thrashing in the regional final. The win set up a semifinal match with Georgia Tech at McNichols Arena in Denver. Trailing by seven at the half, UNLV rallied for an 89–80 triumph and a date in the championship. The 1990 NCAA Championship was all UNLV as an 18–0 run midway through the second half sent Duke reeling as the Rebels ran up the most lopsided victory in championship history, 103–73. Hunt was named Most Outstanding Player at the Final Four for his performance as the Rebels finished the season 35–5. The squad was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.|$|E
500|$|Antifreeze {{products}} for automotive use containing propylene glycol {{in place of}} ethylene glycol are available, and are generally considered safer to use, as it possesses an unpleasant taste {{in contrast to the}} perceived [...] "sweet" [...] taste of toxic ethylene glycol-based coolants, and only produces lactic acid in an animal's body, as <b>their</b> <b>muscles</b> do when exercised.|$|E

40|$|Even in {{the absence}} of food intake, several animal species {{recovering}} from physical activity of high intensity can replenish completely <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> glycogen stores. In some species of mammals, such as in rats and humans, glycogen repletion is only partial, thus suggesting that a few consecutive bouts of high-intensity exercise might eventually lead to the sustained depletion of <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> glycogen. In order to test this prediction, groups of rats with a lead weight of 10 % body mass attached to their tails were subjected to either one, two or three bouts of high-intensity swimming, each bout being separated from the next by a 1 h re covery period. Although glycogen repletion after the first bout of exercise was only partial, all the glycogen mobilised in subsequent bouts was completely replenished during the corresponding recovery periods and irrespective of muscle fibre compositions. The impact of repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise on plasma levels of fatty acids, acetoacetate and ß-hydroxybutyrate suggests that the metabolic state of the rat prior to the second and third bouts of exercise was different from that before the first bout. In conclusion, rats resemble other vertebrate species in that without food intake there are conditions under which they can replenish completely <b>their</b> <b>muscle</b> glycogen stores from endogenous carbon sources when recovering from high-intensity exercise. It remains to be established, however, whether this capacity is typical of mammals in general...|$|R
