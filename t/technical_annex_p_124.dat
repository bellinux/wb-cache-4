40|$|The task of Work Package 10 is {{to specify}} the {{objective}} functions to be optimised in the project. As {{set out in the}} <b>Technical</b> <b>Annex</b> of the project, there are to be two or at most three versions of the objective function. The first one is to reflect economic efficiency objectives. The second one is to reflect concerns about the sustainability of urban transport. A combination of the two may possibly reflect both kinds of objectives and a definite trade-off between them. There is of course a wide range of objectives of transport policy in urban areas, but most can be grouped under the broad headings of economic efficiency, including economic development, on the one hand, and sustainability, including environment, safety, equity and quality of life, on the other. Therefore, although the objectives of the nine studied cities will inevitably be different, if the objective functions are adequately specified, it should be possible for each of them to find its own transport policy objectives mirrored in either the economic efficiency objective function or the sustainability objective function, or both. To enhance the chances that the optimal policies that we identify in the project will in fact be implemented, an important element of Work Package 10 is to discuss the formulation of the objective functions with the cities, and to secure that the final specification is acceptable to them. The transport models of the nine cities differ as to what policies can be modelled and what information they produce. These practical limitations will have {{to be taken into account}} when formulating the objective functions. The methods in use to evaluate urban transport policy differ between the cities. For example, cost benefit analyses are not used everywhere, and the effects included in these kinds of analyses and the weights attached to them differ. To take account of that, a disaggregated yet simple form of presentation of the results of applying the objective functions to each particular model run is sought. It will then be possible for each city to relate the results to their usual evaluation methods. Also, each city may use their own values for the discount rate, value of time savings etc. within limits imposed by the needs to compare the results of the different cities. Summing up, the task of Work Package 10 is to >specify a standard set of objective functions for both economic efficiency and sustainability, which are acceptable to, and can be applied in, all the cities being studied< (<b>Technical</b> <b>Annex,</b> <b>p.</b> 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: MEK 1 {{mutations}} in melanoma can confer resistance to BRAF inhibitors, although preexisting MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> mutations do not preclude clinical responses. We {{sought to determine}} whether recurrent, preexisting MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> mutations affected clinical outcome in BRAF inhibitor–treated patients with melanoma. Methods: Data from four published datasets were analyzed to determine whether preexisting MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> mutations affect radiologic response or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BRAFV 600 -mutant metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib or dabrafenib. The effects of MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> mutations on MAPK pathway activity and response to BRAF inhibition were also investigated {{in a series of}} cell models. Results: In a pooled analysis of 123 patients, the presence of a pretreatment MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> mutation (N = 12, 10 %) was associated with a poorer RECIST response (33 % vs. 72 % in MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> Q/S vs. MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> wild-type, <b>P</b> = 0. 018), and a shorter PFS (median 3. 1 vs. 4. 8 months, P = 0. 004). Furthermore, MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> Q/S mutations were shown to have independent kinase activity and introduction of these {{mutations in}}to a BRAF-mutant melanoma cell line diminished inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by dabrafenib and enhanced clonogenic survival in the presence of dabrafenib compared with cells ectopically expressing wild-type MEK 1. Consistent with these data, two BRAF-mutant cell lines with endogenous MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> mutations showed intermediate sensitivity to dabrafenib, but were highly sensitive to downstream inhibition of MEK or ERK. Conclusion: Taken together, our data indicate that preexisting MEK 1 <b>P</b> <b>124</b> mutations are associated with a reduced response to BRAF inhibitor therapy and identify a subset of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma likely to benefit from combination therapies involving MEK or ERK inhibitors. 8 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|Following the Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus, {{the first}} country had {{submitted}} a Biennial Update Report with a <b>Technical</b> <b>Annex</b> containing the details on emission reductions from REDD+ eligible activities.
