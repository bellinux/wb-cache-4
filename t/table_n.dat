40|$|Correspondence {{analysis}} is a multivariate technique used to visualize categorical data, usually {{data in a}} two-way contingency table.

40|$|Abstract. Supertask {{theory is}} used here {{to prove a}} {{contradictory}} result which involves the consistency of ω-order and the Axiom of Infinity. As is well known, supertask theory assumes the possibility of performing infinitely many actions in a finite time (see [3] for background details). The short discussion that follows analyzes this assumption by mean of an elementary supertask which consist in interchanging infinitely many times one of the rows of an ω-ordered table. In fact, consider the ω-ordered <b>table</b> <b>N</b> 1 of all natural numbers whose successive rows are 1, 2, 3, [...] .; and a supertask 〈ci〉i∈N each of whose successive actions ci consist in interchanging the relative positions of the i-th and (i+ 1) -th rows of N.

40|$|Abstract Background Involving {{patients}} {{in decision making}} on diagnostic procedures requires a basic level of statistical thinking. However, innumeracy is prevalent even among physicians. In medical teaching the 2 × 2 table is widely used as a visual help for computations whereas in psychology the frequency tree is favoured. We assumed that the 2 × 2 table is more suitable to support computations of predictive values. Methods 184 students without prior statistical training were randomised either to a step-by-step self-learning tutorial using the 2 × 2 <b>table</b> (<b>n</b> = 94) or the frequency tree (n = 90). During the training session students were instructed by two sample tasks {{and a total of}} five positive predictive values had to be computed. During a follow-up session 4 weeks later participants had to compute 5 different tasks of comparable degree of difficulty without having the tutorial instructions at their disposal. The primary outcome was the correct solution of the tasks. Results There were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups. About 58 % achieved correct solutions in 4 – 5 tasks following the training session and 26 % in the follow-up examination. Conclusions These findings do not support the hypothesis that the 2 × 2 table is more valuable to facilitate the calculation of positive predictive values than the frequency tree. </p...|$|E
