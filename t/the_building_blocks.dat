5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
5|$|The SI base {{units are}} <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> {{of the system}} and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first {{introduced}} the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> {{model is}} a tool for {{spreading}} or amortizing the expenditure of a regulated firm over time. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> model, when applied correctly and consistently over time, ensures that the firm earns a revenue stream with a present value equal to {{the present value of}} its expenditure stream. Put another way, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> model ensures that {{over the life of the}} firm, the cash-flow stream of the firm has a net present value equal to zero.|$|R
50|$|If a {{compound}} containing {{more than two}} kinds of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> is synthesized, a step is added before the deprotection of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> bound to <b>the</b> bead; a functional group {{which is on the}} bead and did not react with an added <b>building</b> <b>block</b> has to be protected by another protecting group which is not removed at the deprotective condition of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block.</b> Byproducts which lack <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> of this step only are prevented by this step. In addition, this step makes it easy to purify the synthesized compound after cleavage from the bead.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> {{model is}} a form of public utility {{regulation}} that is common in Australia. Variants of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> model are currently used in Australia in the regulation of electricity transmission and distribution, gas transmission and distribution, railways, postal services, urban water and sewerage services, irrigation infrastructure, and port access. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has stated that it intends to use a version of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> model to determine indicative access prices for fixed-line telecommunications services. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> model is so-called because the allowed revenue of the regulated firm is equal to the sum of underlying components or <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of <b>the</b> return on capital, the return of capital (also known as depreciation), the operating expenditure, and various other components such as taxes and incentive mechanisms.|$|R
5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and trimer domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired oligonucleotide, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> are {{sequentially}} coupled {{to the growing}} oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15â€“25 bases in length.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the basic}} method of {{solid-phase}} synthesis, <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> that have two function groups are used. One of the functional groups of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> is usually {{protected by a}} protective group. The starting material is a bead which binds to <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>block.</b> At first, this bead is added into the solution of <b>the</b> protected <b>building</b> <b>block</b> and stirred. After the reaction between the bead and <b>the</b> protected <b>building</b> <b>block</b> is completed, <b>the</b> solution is removed and the bead is washed. Then the protecting group is removed and the above steps are repeated. After all steps are finished, the synthesized compound is {{cut off from the}} bead.|$|R

5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw water down between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia in the groove push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, diatoms, flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (<b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> of proteins) through their skins, mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
