5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. <b>The</b> <b>players,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Australia's openers Morris and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions greeted <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris. Bradman {{came in and}} the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes {{was involved in}} some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket {{and handed it to}} the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E

The first competitive game was a 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A match between Corinthians and Figueirense on 18 May 2014. The first international match was the opening match for the FIFA World Cup 2014 between Brazil and Croatia on 12 June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E

5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their sleeves and played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the entire team, and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; {{it was the last time}} a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather greeted <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved {{of the new}} ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung {{the ball into the}} right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Kerry Packer {{established}} the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced {{many of the}} now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England {{and other parts of}} the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.|$|E

5|$|On April 2, the Bears began a {{voluntary}} offseason program, {{and because they}} had a new head coach, the Bears were given a two-week earlier start than teams that did not hire a new head coach. For {{the first two weeks of}} the program, the only activities allowed were strength and conditioning and rehabilitation, and only strength and conditioning coaches are allowed to be on the field with <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> third week, {{a voluntary}} minicamp was held, and all coaches were permitted to work. From April 16–18, the Bears held two-hour non-contact drills, and held ten organized team activities (OTAs) during May 13 – June 6, followed by a mandatory minicamp from June 11–13.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Carter met Jerry Lawler, {{her future}} husband, at a charity {{softball}} game at Treadwell High School in Memphis on July 23, 1989, {{two months before}} her nineteenth birthday.

Lawler, however, was married at the time, and he claims that when he initially met Carter, he considered an affair. After Lawler separated from his wife, Carter moved in with him. When Carter first met Lawler, she {{was working as a}} bank teller. Lawler later helped her get a job at a photography studio, and she also opened and ran her own hair salon.|$|E
5|$|The 1959–60 season saw Davidson {{confronted with}} an arduous eight Test {{tour of the}} Indian subcontinent, with three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively. Flat and dry pitches unconducive to fast bowling {{combined}} with oppressive heat confronted <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> last tour, many of the Australians had fallen ill with food positioning, and Davidson had asked Donald Bradman, the Australian Chairman of Selectors if opting out of the tour was permitted. Bradman turned him down. Davidson was consistent throughout the Pakistan series, taking four wickets {{in each of the}} three Tests, to end with 12 wickets at 24.83. He also batted solidly, with 47 and 39* in the latter two Tests to end with 90runs at 45.00. His contributions helped Australia to a 2–0 series result; it was the first time Pakistan had lost a Test on home soil and the pair of victories were its last in Pakistan for 39years. He had particular success against Imtiaz Ahmed, removing him four times.|$|E

5|$|The 1976 World Ice Hockey Championships in Katowice {{were the}} first to feature {{professionals}} although in the end only the United States made use of the new rule, recalling eight pros from the Minnesota North Stars and Minnesota Fighting Saints. The first fully open World Championship was held in 1977 in Vienna, Austria, and saw the first participation of active Canadian NHL players, including two-time NHL MVP Phil Esposito. Sweden and Finland also augmented their rosters with a few NHL and WHA players. Many of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canadian team were not prepared for the tournament and were unfamiliar with the international game. The team finished fourth, losing both games to the Soviet Union by a combined score of 19–2. Czechoslovakia won gold, becoming the third team (after Canada and the Soviet Union) to win consecutive championships.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens were {{scheduled}} to play the Montreal Maroons the evening of March 9, a game the NHL offered to cancel in honour of Morenz's death. However Mary insisted the game be played, saying that Morenz would have wanted the game to continue. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canadiens and Maroons wore black armbands for the game, and prior to the start, two minutes of silence were observed in his honour. A similar event happened in New York, where the New York Rangers and New York Americans had {{a moment of silence}} before the start of their game.|$|E
5|$|The {{events were}} precipitated by an {{incident}} in the previous meeting between the two teams, when Ottawa's Martin Havlat had swung his stick at Mark Recchi's head. Just under two minutes {{before the end of}} the game, enforcers Donald Brashear of the Flyers and Rob Ray of the Senators engaged in a fight. As they skated off to the penalty box, Brashear became involved in another scrap, and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice for each team, including goaltenders Robert Esche and Patrick Lalime began to fight. On both of the next two face-offs to restart the game, further fights occurred. The first of these angered the Flyers management, who believed that the fights were deliberately unbalanced against their players.|$|E

5|$|A game {{is played}} between two teams, each {{composed}} of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat {{and one in the}} field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings {{at the high school level}} and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.|$|E
5|$|Clint Benedict was {{the first}} goaltender to wear facial protection, donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose. He quickly {{abandoned}} his mask as its design interfered with his vision. Twenty-nine years later, on November 1, 1959, {{in a game against}} New York Rangers Jacques Plante made the goaltender mask a permanent fixture in hockey. The first players' union was formed February 12, 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat {{on the board of the}} NHL's Pension Society since 1952. Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund. The league claimed that it could not contribute more than it did but <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pension Committee suspected otherwise. The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union's founding was announced publicly, nearly every NHL player had signed up. Led by Alan Eagleson, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) was formed in 1967 and it quickly received acceptance from the owners.|$|E
