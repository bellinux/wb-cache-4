Most existing algorithms use color to classify pixels as road or background. These algorithms reduce the effect of lighting variations and weather conditions by exploiting the discriminant/invariant properties of different color rep-resentations. However, up to date, no comparison between these representations have been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of existing color rep-resentations for road detection. More specifically, we focus on color planes derived from RGB data and their most com-mon combinations. The evaluation is done {{on a set of}} 7000 road images acquired using an on-board camera in different real-driving situations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Detecting <b>traversable</b> <b>road</b> areas ahead {{a moving}} vehicle {{is a key}} process for modern {{autonomous}} driving systems. A common approach to road detection consists of exploiting color features to classify pixels as road or background. These algorithms reduce the effect of lighting variations and weather conditions by exploiting the discriminant/invariant properties of different color representations. Furthermore, the lack of labeled datasets has motivated the development of algorithms performing on single images {{based on the assumption}} that the bottom part of the image belongs to the road surface. In this paper, we first introduce a dataset of road images taken at different times and in different scenarios using an onboard camera. Then, we devise a simple online algorithm and conduct an exhaustive evaluation of different classifiers and the effect of using different color representation to characterize pixels.
