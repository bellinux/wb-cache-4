Poland appeared weak on price competitiveness in Wood and Wood Products and Printing and Publishing. The Czech Republic has relatively low price levels in Chemicals. For <b>Total</b> Manufacturing, <b>Hungary</b> shows a clear productivity advantage despite a comparable relative price level (compare Figure 1). The Hungarian productivity advantage is in strong Food Products, Paper and Printing, and Wood Products (even though in the latter case it is benefitting from low relative price levels), but also in Machinery and Transport Equipment and in Other Manufacturing. The Polish productivity level is high in Rubber and Plastic Products, and in the Czech Republic it is high in Chemicals, which in both cases is reflected by relatively low price levels.

50|$|Agriculture {{accounted}} for 4.3% of GDP in 2008 {{and along with}} the food industry occupied roughly 7.7% of the labor force. These two figures represent only the primary agricultural production: along with related businesses, agriculture makes up about 13% of the GDP. Hungarian agriculture is virtually self-sufficient and due to traditional reasons export-oriented: exports related to agriculture make up 20-25% of the total. About half of <b>Hungary’s</b> <b>total</b> land area is agricultural area under cultivation; this ratio is prominent among other EU members. This {{is due to the}} country's favourable conditions including continental climate and the plains that make up about half of Hungary’s landscape. The most important crops are wheat, corn, sunflower, potato, sugar beet, canola and a wide variety of fruits (notably apple, peach, pear, grape, watermelon, plum etc.).

5000|$|Whether or not peasants {{really wanted}} to join, the {{adjustments}} made to the agricultural system in 1957 clearly managed to satisfy the membership adequately enough that the co-operatives did not fall apart as {{they had in the}} past. Like Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia underwent a Stalinist phase of collectivization in the 1950s before leaving it behind in the search for a new model. In Poland, a sort of “dual agricultural” model was developed in which 20% of land was controlled by large, inefficient state farms, and the rest privately owned, mostly in the form of small peasant farms. This isolated situation left the peasants open to obvious discrimination and they suffered from a lack of financial and structural support from the state. In Czechoslovakia, the state had only a bare tolerance for household plots and the transitional system was marked by its almost total inflexibility. In contrast, transitional measures in Hungary worked with the concerns of the farmers, allowing them mechanical independence, semi-private production on their household plots and crop-shared fields, and a decent standard of living from higher agricultural producer prices and substantial government investment. By 1989, <b>Hungary's</b> <b>total</b> annual agricultural output was larger than that of France.|$|R

After calibration, {{the model was}} run for the four major land cover types such as croplands, grasslands, deciduous and coniferous forests {{for the period of}} 2002 – 2007. Our calculations suggest that all Hungarian ecological systems together formed a net carbon dioxide source during the time period studied. Since agricultural fields cover more than 50 % of the <b>total</b> area of <b>Hungary,</b> the net carbon dioxide flux is dominated by the carbon balance of croplands. The average net release of CO 2 is 8. 7 Mt per year with significant interannual variation: the highest net emission was 21. 6 Mt CO 2 in 2003, while the lowest was 1. 2 Mt CO 2 in 2006. Due to the model limitations, simulated CO 2 release from croplands is most likely overestimated, thus, the present results provide an upper limit for the potential range of the carbon balance of Hungary.

50|$|The most {{important}} {{result of the}} battle was that the military initiative was taken for two months by the Hungarian army, while the Habsburg army was defeated {{in a series of}} battles (Battle of Vác, Battle of Nagysalló, Battle of Komárom, Siege of Buda), and forced to retreat towards West. Also the Battle of Isaszeg played a decisive role in the dismissal of Windisch-Grätz from the lead of the Habsburg armies by the emperor on 12 April, who named Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden in his place, although until his arrival his duties were fulfilled by Josip Jelačić. However these changes in the command of the army did not produce a change in the military situation for the Austrian side, their situation continuing to worsen day by day because of the new defeats they suffered, which caused their retreat from almost all the territory they occupied between December and March in Hungary.In the day after the battle of Isaszeg, Lajos Kossuth, the President of the National Defense Committee arrived to Gödöllő and moved in the Grassalkovich-Palace, which was the headquarters of Windisch-Grätz until the previous day. Here he formulated the Hungarian Declaration of Independence, which declared the removal of the House of Habsburg from the leadership of <b>Hungary</b> and <b>Hungary's</b> <b>total</b> independence. Although independence was declared on 14 April 1849 in Debrecen, it was decided in Gödöllő following the victories of the Spring Campaign, and in particular the Battle of Isaszeg.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSoil erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} land degradation processes on agricultural areas in Hungary. 25 % of the <b>total</b> area of <b>Hungary</b> (more than one-third of agricultural land) is affected by water erosion, 16 % by wind erosion. The role of gully erosion has been recognized only lately. The hilly countries of Hungary are mainly covered by unconsolidated sediments, mainly by loess. Loess covered areas are prone to erosion and mass movements. The paper provides an analysis of environmental conditions of gully development in Hungary. The role of gully erosion in total soil loss at catchment scale is shown on the example of the Tetves catchment (120 km 2, subcatchment of Lake Balaton catchment). A completely filled up sediment reservoir can be found at the catchment outlet. An attempt is made to determine the share of the material removed by gully erosion, based on the analysis of the sediment accumulated in the reservoir. If there is more topsoil in the reservoir then the role of sheet erosion is more important in the catchment, while more subsoil in the reservoir points to considerable gully erosion activity. Humus content and Caesium- 137 activity were used as indicators of the topsoil. Gully erosion activity was investigated in the whole catchment in 1968, 1984 and 2004 using maps, air photos and field survey. The results show that approximately half of the deposited sediments came from the “subsoil” layer pointing to the important role of gully erosion. The main conclusion is that the Caesium- 137 method proved to be very well applicable to identify sediments originating for gully erosion activity. For policy makers it is suggested that land use planning should ensure a minimum risk of gully erosion with special emphasis on afforestation...|$|R
50|$|Görgei {{had refused}} the medals of {{military}} honor, Kossuth's offer of the field-marshal's baton, {{and was not}} in sympathy with the new regime. However, he accepted the portfolio of minister of war, while retaining the command of the troops in the field. Meanwhile, at the Parliament from Debrecen, Kossuth had formally proposed the dethronement of the Habsburg dynasty, which the Parliament accepted declaring the <b>total</b> independence of <b>Hungary</b> at 14 April 1849. Görgei was against the dethronement (although he did not protested, when Kossuth divulged his plan to him at Gödöllő after the battle from Isaszeg), because he taught {{that this will be}} considered as a provocation, which will urge the Austrians to demand for the Russian intervention. He taught that renouncing to the dethronement and using the great Hungarian military successes he achieved as arguments in an eventual negotiation with the Austrians, could convince them to recognize Hungary's autonomy under the rule of the House of Habsburg, and the April Laws of 1848, because he believed that this is the only choice to convince the Habsburgs to renounce to ask Russia's help against Hungary, which he taught that will cause destruction and a national tragedy. This is why Görgei even tried to talk in secret with the Hungarian Peace Party (who were in favor of a compromise with the Austrians), to help him to make a coup d'état to overthrow Kossuth and the Hungarian Government led by Bertalan Szemere, to achieve the political leadership in order to start the talks with the Habsburgs, but the Peace Party refused to help him, fearing that a military dictatorship will take over the political power, so he had to renounce to this plan. However Görgei was wrong when he taught that the Hungarian Declaration of Independence caused the Russian intervention, because the Austrians had asked it, and the tzar accepted to send troops against Hungary before they had learned about the Declaration of Independence from 14 April.|$|R
