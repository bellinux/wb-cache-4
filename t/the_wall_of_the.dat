5|$|Another change {{inspired}} by the move was a return for the Football Echo man. The cartoon character had for years indicated the match results of Sunderland with a smile, a frown or a tear, while adorning the outside wall of the Bridge Street building. After several years in storage, he was returned to <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Echo building in 1976, where he still remains today.|$|E

5|$|In about 1797 a {{schoolmaster}} {{living in}} the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John Stair) was the original cultivator, but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the tree was unveiled on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village school.|$|E

5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of}} the pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} LH matures {{the egg and}} weakens <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{follicle}} in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its secondary oocyte.

40|$|Occurrence <b>of</b> {{supernumerary}} {{bones in}} <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit especially in <b>the</b> medial <b>wall</b> and <b>the</b> roof has beendescribed in <b>the</b> literature. Studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> supernumerary bones in <b>the</b> bony <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit are scarce in theliterature. Present study was undertaken to find <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> supernumerary bones in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit in acollection of adult Indian skulls. In {{the present study}} three hundred and twenty six orbital walls from one hundred and sixty three skulls wereexamined for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sutural bones. Their location with reference to <b>the</b> sutures in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit andtheir size was noted. The supernumerary bones were found in 25 skulls (15. 34 %) mainly in <b>the</b> lateral <b>wall</b> (11. 04 %) and theroof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit (4. 29 %). Prevalence of such supernumerary bones in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bony orbit is of anthropologicalinterest.

5|$|Viewed with a microscope, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{apothecium}} is made {{of three}} tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, leathery and compact, {{and covered with a}} fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front porch {{on the ground}} floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery {{for a long time and}} on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|A one-story kitchen addition, {{built in}} 1961–1962 and {{measuring}} about , {{extends from the}} northwest side of the original 1855 house. The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast side and a door (adjoining <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition. The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands.|$|E

5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane on fire.|$|E

5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E
