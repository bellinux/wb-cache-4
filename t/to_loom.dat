5|$|Dissatisfaction {{with this}} state of affairs {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>loom</b> over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but abdicated.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins <b>to</b> <b>loom</b> larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E

40|$|Detecting {{a looming}} object and its {{imminent}} collision {{is imperative to}} survival. For most humans, it is a fundamental aspect of daily activities such as driving, road crossing and participating in sport, yet {{little is known about}} how the brain both detects and responds to such stimuli. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess neural response <b>to</b> <b>looming</b> stimuli in comparison with receding stimuli and motion-controlled static stimuli. We demonstrate for the first time that, in the human, the superior colliculus and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus respond <b>to</b> <b>looming</b> in addition <b>to</b> cortical regions associated with motor preparation. We also implicate the anterior insula in making timing computations for collision events. ...|$|R

5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began <b>to</b> <b>loom</b> on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only <b>to</b> <b>loom</b> larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E

West of NY28A, NY28 continues towards the north and west along the northern edge of the reservoir. In West Hurley, the route intersects the southern terminus of NY375. It proceeds along the reservoir to its western end in the town of Olive community of Boiceville, where NY28A reconnects to the route. Here the mountains begin <b>to</b> <b>loom</b> over the road, with Mount Tremper dominating the view to the north as the route continues along Esopus Creek into the town of Shandaken after passing the southern terminus of NY212 at Mount Pleasant.

40|$|The <b>looming</b> {{priority}} refers <b>to</b> organisms&# 39; {{prior processing}} of or greater sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>looming</b> signals. The looming priority has been {{commonly found in}} visual, auditory and cross modalities and different kinds of subjects including human and animals. Humanneuroimaging studies suggest that neural substrate associated with the priority involves a massive distributed neural network coordinating and communicating to each other, including the superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction and some motor areas. The neurons and neural pathways selectively sensitive <b>to</b> <b>looming</b> signals {{have been found in}} many kinds of animals. The looming priority is explained from different perspectives, including threatening hypothesis, attentional capture hypothesis and automatic processing hypothesis. Future studies may focus on the role of social and emotional features of looming stimuli and the integration mechanism of multisensory looming stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Avoiding {{the strike}} of an {{approaching}} predator requires rapid visual detection of a looming object, followed by a directed escape maneuver. While looming-sensitive neurons have been discovered in various animal species, {{the relative importance of}} stimulus features that are extracted by the visual system is still unclear. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms that compute object approach are largely unknown. We found that a virtual looming stimulus, i. e., a dark expanding disk on a bright background, reliably evoked rapid escape movements. Related stimuli, such as dimming, receding, or bright looming objects, were substantially less effective, and angular size was a critical determinant of escape initiation. Two-photon calcium imaging in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons revealed three retinorecipient areas that responded robustly <b>to</b> <b>looming</b> stimuli. One of these areas, the optic tectum, is innervated by a subset of RGC axons that respond selectively <b>to</b> <b>looming</b> stimuli. Laser-induced lesions of the tectal neuropil impaired the behavior. Our findings demonstrate a visually mediated escape behavior in zebrafish larvae exposed to objects approaching on a collision course. This response is sensitive to spatiotemporal parameters of the looming stimulus. Our data indicate that a subset of RGC axons within the tectum responds selectively <b>to</b> features of <b>looming</b> stimuli and that this input is necessary for visually evoked escape...|$|R
