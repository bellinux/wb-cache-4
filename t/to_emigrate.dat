5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor <b>to</b> <b>emigrate.</b> By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E

5|$|One of the Old Bay Line's steamers, {{the former}} President Warfield, later became famous as the Exodus ship of book and movie fame, when Jewish {{refugees}} from war-torn Europe sailed aboard her in 1947 in an unsuccessful attempt <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> to Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of the fatwa was limited to Spain. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, the predominant opinion upheld the requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims <b>to</b> <b>emigrate,</b> or even choose martyrdom, when the orthodox observance of the religion became impossible.|$|E

5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews <b>to</b> <b>emigrate.</b> The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E

5|$|His patroonship {{became the}} most {{successful}} to exist, {{making full use of}} his business tactics and advantages, such as his connection to the Director of New Netherland, his confidantes at the West India Company, and his extended family members who were eager <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> to a better place to farm.

5|$|Major Francis L. Dade, {{military}} commandant at Key West, received {{intelligence that}} Cuba and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did not confirm the rumor. Reports coming from Fort Brooke, near present-day Tampa, noted that Indians {{in the area}} were resisting orders {{from the federal government}} <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> to Mississippi, contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians had agreed <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at Tampa Bay, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King, near present-day Ocala. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.|$|E

To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.|$|E

5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision <b>to</b> <b>emigrate.</b> Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|In October 1939, Hitler and Mussolini {{concluded}} the South Tyrol Option Agreement {{under which the}} German-speaking population of South Tyrol was given the choice of complete Italianisation—abandoning their German language and even their personal names—or emigrating to Nazi Germany. As a result, Hess {{and his family were}} forced to return to Germany. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>emigrate</b> to Switzerland or Brazil failed, so they moved briefly back to Düsseldorf before resettling in Unterwössen, a small village in the district of Traunstein in the far south-east of Bavaria, where his daughter attended the Landschulheim Marquartstein, a local gymnasium and boarding school.|$|E
