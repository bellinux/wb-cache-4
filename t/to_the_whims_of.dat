5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E
25|$|When in the 19th century Renaissance style {{architecture}} {{came into}} vogue, it often materialized {{not just in}} its original form according to geography, but as a hybrid of all its earlier forms according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> architects and patrons rather than geography and culture. If this were not confusing enough, the new Neo-Renaissance then frequently borrowed architectural elements from the succeeding Mannerist period, {{and in many cases}} the even later Baroque period. Mannerism and Baroque being two very opposing styles of architecture. Mannerism was exemplified by the Palazzo del Te and Baroque by the Wurzburg Residenz.|$|E

The distance from shore to shore was great and the steamboat traffic highly congested. The only solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a wire cable suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France.|$|E
500|$|Boydell {{realised}} {{early in}} his career that his engravings had little artistic merit, saying later that they were collected by others [...] "more to show the improvement of art in this country , since the period of their publication, than from any idea of their own merits". This may explain why in 1751, when he {{became a member of the}} Stationers' Company, he started buying other artists' plates and publishing them in addition to his own. Ordinarily an engraver, such as William Hogarth, had his own shop or took his finished engravings to a publisher. In adopting the dual role of artist and print dealer, Boydell altered the traditional organisation of print shops. He was not subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> public taste: if his engraves did not sell well, he could supplement his earnings by trading in the prints of other artists. He also understood the concerns of both the engraver and the publisher. In fact, as a publisher, he did much to help raise the level of respect for engravers in addition to furnishing them with better paying commissions.|$|E
500|$|By 1830, Sherwood's works {{had drifted}} away from evangelicalism and her novels and stories {{reflected}} more conventional Victorian plots and themes. For example, Gipsy Babes (1826), perhaps inspired by Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815), emphasizes [...] "human affections." [...] In 1835, she published a Gothic novel for adolescents titled Shanty the Blacksmith; it employs all the tropes of the genre—"lost heir, ruined castle, humble helpers and faithful retainer, sinister and mysterious gypsies, prisoner and plot" [...] in what Cutt calls [...] "a gripping" [...] and [...] "exciting tale." [...] In 1835 Sherwood published the novel Caroline Mordaunt; {{it tells the}} story of a young woman forced to become a governess. Her parents die when she is young, but luckily her relatives pay to educate her so that she can earn her own living. The novel follows her progress from a flighty, discontented girl to a reliable, content woman; she learns how to accommodate herself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the proud nobility, silly literati, and dogmatic evangelicals. She realizes that in her dependent position she must content herself with less than complete happiness. Once she recognizes this, though, she finds God and, in the last chapter, an ideal husband, thus granting her near complete happiness. Cutt suggests that Sherwood drew on the works of Jane Austen and Jane Taylor for a new [...] "lively, humorous, and satirical strain" [...] in works such as this.|$|E

500|$|The film {{also makes}} {{substantial}} use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect {{to accentuate the}} lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo is subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never {{goes back into the}} cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. [...] At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts, and it begins to reverse. Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking – being able to live a life without choice, for while you never choose all things remain possible. The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, to the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width and time), and to the imagination of our former selves. And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice, he instinctively opts for another.|$|E

[...] Looting was so extensive that it was initially believed even the bodies of the dead had been stripped of their personal effects, and that operatives from the Department of Justice were being sent to investigate. [...] That this was happening was soon denied by those publicly involved in the incident, however. [...] Still, a local farmer on whose property part of the vessel's wreckage lay began charging the throngs of visitors to enter the crash site at a rate of $1 (equivalent to about $13.60 in 2015) for each automobile and 25¢ per pedestrian as well as 10¢ for a drink of water.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 January 1933, when the {{conservative}} Junker Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin told Papen that his plan to have Hitler as Chancellor while retaining power for himself was an absurd scheme that could only end very badly for everybody, Papen replied: [...] "What do you want? I have the confidence of Hindenburg. In two months we'll have pushed Hitler so far into the corner that he'll squeal." [...] In the end, the President, who had previously vowed never to allow Hitler (whom he derisively {{referred to as a}} 'Bohemian corporal'), to become Chancellor, appointed Hitler to the post on 30 January 1933, with Papen as Vice-Chancellor. The British historian Edgar Feuchtwanger wrote that Schleicher's rapid rise and fall from power was due to the system of presidential government he had created in 1930, as the system of presidential government reduced almost everything down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> President Hindenburg, and gave enormous power to those like Papen who happened to enjoy Hindenburg's trust and favor. [...] The system of presidential government created very personalized politics where those who had the approval of Hindenburg and his Kamarilla enjoyed power {{and those who did not}} were excluded from power, regardless of what the voters felt. On institutional grounds, Papen should had been in a weak position as he was a very unpopular former Chancellor without a seat in the Reichstag or even a political party, whose influence was based entirely on his friendship with Hindenburg. Feuchwanger wrote that Papen was a vain, irresponsible intriguer who was only powerful in January 1933 because he was Hindenburg's favorite politician and the president wanted his favorite back into office again.|$|E

Judges were no longer subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government of the day in whether they could be removed from office. Instead, the commission now provides a means outside politics for the dispassionate consideration of misconduct by judicial officers.

2500|$|... 1835 was an {{important}} year for American labor with many workers particularly in [...] Boston, Philadelphia, New York City and Washington DC petitioning for higher wages, better working conditions [...] and a ten hour work day. In Washington D.C. from early {{in the nineteenth century}} many workers agitated for a reduction in the arduous twelve hour workday. [...] At the navy yard employment conditions, and enslaved labor created problems and strife. For the first thirty years of the nineteen century, the navy yard was the Districts principal employer of enslaved African Americans. White workers fearing job competition and a reduction in wages resented the presence of blacks on the navy yard. On the Yard enslaved African Americans worked as seamen, cooks, servants or laborers; they performed many of the most unpleasant and onerous jobs. The number of blacks free and enslaved rose rapidly and by 1808, muster lists reflect they made up one third of the workforce. On the navy yard slaveholders included both naval officers and senior civilians who collected the wages of their slaves, rented to the navy yard. [...] Labor trouble and racial tension broke out periodically as the restive and volatile workforce sought higher wages and better conditions. Most all naval shipyard workers were per diem or day labor. As such they were subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the annual Congressional appropriation and periodic seasonal reductions [...] in the workforce. Workers during the early nineteenth century lived in a state of constant anxiety regarding employment and wages. Wages were subject to considerable change, in some cases daily pay fluctuated dramatically, e.g. WNY carpenters wages were reduced from a high of $2.50 per day in the year 1808 to $1.64 per day in 1820. [...] Workers actively responded, as early as March 1807; the blacksmiths writing to the Secretary of the Navy, Robert Smith claimed the “right to Demand an Equal Participation with others in the Benefit of our Labour” and their wages restored. The Secretary in response labeled them “a dissatisfied set of men” and threatened to “dismiss all complaining men as soon as publick convenience will permit…” and replace them with a “set of orderly, hard working fellows…” [...] Two Washington Navy Yard “job actions” had occurred previously. [...] The first on 13 March 1827, when a dispute over wages provoked laborers to leave the yard briefly to express their displeasure. The second began on 23 March 1830, when the laborers were recorded “standing out” for a week to show that their per diem wage rate should have been granted sooner. Except for the brief entries made by the officer of the watch however in the station log, {{little is known about the}} exact circumstances of either incident. These job actions represent a period when federal workers, though not unionized [...] could strike - an option later denied to government [...] employees with the passage of the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act. The workday in the all federal navy yards prior to 1835 was sunrise to sunset, with time off for breakfast and lunch. In May 1835, the Boston carpenters issued their famous “Ten Hour Circular,” advocating a ten hour day which found wide distribution throughout the major cities on the eastern seaboard and the District of Columbia and quickly became a rallying cry for reducing the length of the working day. Early in 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours, but their petition was returned to them with the advice, [...] " [...] that to grant it would not be in the interest of the government." ...|$|E
