5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a <b>transmembrane</b> <b>protein</b> that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} subfamily of membrane <b>proteins</b> are the <b>transmembrane</b> α-helical <b>proteins,</b> {{in which}} the membrane-spanning regions {{are made up of}} α-helices. Given the obvious biological and medical significance of these proteins, it is of tremendous practical importance to identify the location of transmembrane segments. The difficulty of inferring the secondary or tertiary structure of <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> using experimental techniques has led to a surge of interest in applying techniques from machine learning and bioinformatics to infer secondary structure from primary structure in these proteins. We are therefore interested in determining which physicochemical properties are most useful for discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments in <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins,</b> and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins,</b> and in using the results of these investigations to develop classifiers to identify transmembrane segments in <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins.</b> Results We determined that the most useful properties for discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> were hydropathy, polarity, and flexibility, and used the results of this analysis to construct classifiers to discriminate transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments using four classification techniques: two variants of the Self-Organizing Global Ranking algorithm, a decision tree algorithm, and a support vector machine algorithm. All four techniques exhibited good performance, with out-of-sample accuracies of approximately 75 %. Conclusions Several interesting observations emerged from our study: intrinsically unstructured segments and transmembrane segments tend to have opposite properties; <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> appear to be much richer in intrinsically unstructured segments than other proteins; and, in approximately 70 % of <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> that contain intrinsically unstructured segments, the intrinsically unstructured segments are close to transmembrane segments. </p...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} other {{molecules}} {{also involved in}} the guidance of axons to and across the midline.

When this occurs they lose responsiveness to netrin and become repulsed by slit/Robo signaling. This is accomplished by {{the formation of a}} DCC-Robo complex, which inhibits attractive netrin/DCC signals while allowing slit/Robo signals. Netrin also has other receptors, the UNC-5 family. The UNC5 receptors have repellant migratory responses to netrin binding, and have similar effects to the slit/Robo system.|$|E

As these proteins are vital parts of many biological processes, an improved understanding of them is important for achieving a better understanding of the mechanisms that constitute life. All proteins consist of an amino acid sequence that fold into a three-dimensional structure in order to perform its biological function. The work presented in this thesis is directed towards improving the understanding of the relationship between sequence and structure for alpha-helical <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins.</b> Specifically, five original methods for predicting the topology of alpha-helical <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> have been developed: PRO-TMHMM, PRODIV-TMHMM, OCTOPUS, Toppred III and SCAMPI. A general conclusion from these studies is that approaches that use multiple sequence information achive the best prediction accuracy. Further, the properties of reentrant regions have been studied, both with respect to sequence and structure. One result of this study is an improved definition of the topological grammar of <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins,</b> which is used in OCTOPUS and shown to further improve topology prediction. Finally, Z-coordinates, an alternative system for representation of topological information for <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> that is based on distance to the membrane center has been introduced, and a method for predicting Z-coordinates from amino acid sequence, Z-PRED, has been developed...|$|R
40|$|With recent {{development}} of proteomics, {{the importance of}} <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins</b> has been widely acknowledged.

The framework consists of two steps: The N-gram model revamped for processing protein sequences was used as a feature extraction algorithm; then, we compared the performance of the popular classifiers logistic regression, Random Forests, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor using the N-gram model. N-gram combined with the Random Forests classifier obtained the highest accuracy at 95. 6 %, which is higher than other methods. The finding can help future studies on the structure and function of <b>transmembrane</b> <b>proteins,</b> drug design, and the classification of membrane proteins.
