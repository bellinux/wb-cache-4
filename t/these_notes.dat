Even though larger denominations being withdrawn around the world, the MAS has retained the use of the $10,000 denomination. MAS discontinued issuing new $10,000 banknotes from 1 October 2014 as authorities suspect <b>these</b> <b>notes</b> are meant for illegal purposes.|$|E

5|$|Giuseppe Elia Pace, an {{advocate}} and {{close friend of}} Mikiel Anton Vassalli, {{was found guilty of}} treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta. Vassalli was imprisoned at the Klistanija {{at the end of the}} rule of the Order of St. John, and was accused of plotting revolutionary ideas during the magistracy of Grand Master Hompesch. Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits from the father of Fortunato Panzavecchia. While dining together around a table with prison guards, Panzavecchia took notes from conversations he had with Vassalli. <b>These</b> <b>notes</b> shed more light on the life of Vassalli, who after his death became the national Maltese linguistic. Though given a life sentence, he either managed to escape or was released after the expulsion of the Order from Malta.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Ferdinand VII {{refused to}} renew the Spanish Constitution of 1812, {{returning}} the Empire to an absolutist method of government. Consequently, Ramírez contacted some of his allies in Philadelphia and commissioned the production of banknotes in denominations of 3 and 5 reales. The issues were printed by Murray, Draper, Fairman & Company and featured the signatures of treasurer José Bacener and Ramírez. The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's profile in the two varieties and were numbered manually. No official documentation, letter or decree from the Spanish Crown related {{to the creation of}} <b>these</b> <b>notes</b> have surfaced. These issues were collected and destroyed with extreme efficacy in 1866, leaving only a few dozen intact.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred <b>these</b> <b>notes</b> were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E

5|$|The first {{banknotes}} of Zimbabwe {{were issued}} by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of Rhodesia) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 {{to coincide with the}} independence of Zimbabwe. <b>These</b> <b>notes</b> replaced the circulating banknotes of the Rhodesian Dollar at par. The first series of banknotes ranged from $2 to $20, and carried the signature of Dr. Desmond Krogh, then the last Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia from 1973. From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997. As rising inflation started to affect the purchasing power of the Zimbabwean Dollar, the $500 and $1000 banknotes were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures.|$|E
5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of <b>these</b> <b>notes</b> were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{controversy}} and celebrity surrounding the case, the judicial duel between Carrouges and Le Gris {{was the last}} ever permitted by the French government and as such a well attended and infamous event, it soon attracted near-legendary status. In France {{the memory of the}} duel far outlasted its participants, primarily a result of it being recorded soon after by the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart. Over the following century, vivid and imaginative accounts were carried in the chronicles of Jean Juvénal des Ursins and the Grandes Chroniques de France as well as by Jehan de Waurin and others, many embellishing the story with imaginative twists. The factual details of the case are unusually well recorded for a medieval trial as the records of the Parlement de Paris have survived intact and Jacques Le Gris' lawyer Jean Le Coq kept meticulous notes on the case which still exist. In addition to a clear view of proceedings <b>these</b> <b>notes</b> also contain Le Coq's own concerns about his client, whose innocence Le Coq deemed highly suspect.|$|E

5|$|Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was {{confined}} to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated the expanse of the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on <b>these</b> <b>notes,</b> a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated {{the range of the}} bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock paintings in the Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, would be good for the country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave <b>these</b> <b>notes</b> to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency first issued during the Civil War. The government accepted <b>these</b> <b>notes</b> as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|E
