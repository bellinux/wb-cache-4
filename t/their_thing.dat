500|$|... "Sleeping {{with the}} One I Love" [...] was written and {{produced}} by R. Kelly. During {{the early stages}} of production for The Definition Of..., Fantasia posted several videos on her social media accounts of her recording sessions with Kelly. In promotional interviews, Fantasia said that the album was initially produced by another artist who she “really, really, really loved", but she switched to a different team for the final product. She explained: [...] "Sometimes, when you work with producers who are artists, it’s very hard, They are doing <b>their</b> <b>thing</b> … and things got a little chaotic.” Derrick G. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times speculated that Kelly was the producer mentioned by Fantasia.|$|E

She told a Miami Herald interviewer, [...] "You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. They would just be as cool as can be doing <b>their</b> <b>thing.</b> I thought, 'I could never do this job.'" ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the guitar}} sound, the group tried to balance Grohl's [...] "playing the rhythm {{straight}} up the middle", Shiflett's [...] "sharp and clean sense of melodic playing", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that [...] "with three guitars, {{you have to}} be careful that it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing <b>their</b> <b>thing</b> really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated." [...] Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett and add a heavier sound - as Grohl declared, [...] "if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge." [...] Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills at the suggestion of Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of the producer's favorite drummers, Ian Paice.|$|E

500|$|Along with a {{thank you}} note from [...] "Jean Daniels" [...] of HINT also came a {{supposed}} list {{of others in the}} area with similar interests as possible pen pals. But Jacobson never wrote to any of them. So Comfort, under the pseudonym [...] "Carl Long", wrote back using a technique called [...] "mirroring", claiming to have interests calculated to be similar to those believed held by Jacobson, and specifically, to be equally interested in depictions of sex acts between young boys. Jacobson said he, too, liked [...] "good looking young guys (in their late teens and early 20's) doing <b>their</b> <b>thing</b> together". Neither Jacobson nor Comfort made any more explicit reference to pornographic materials and Jacobson stopped writing back after two letters. With no evidence that he had ever watched or possessed any child pornography, the USPS again dropped its efforts against him.|$|E
500|$|... "We Get Ill" [...] was {{reviewed}} by Spin, who called it [...] "a seamy celebration of bad habits and bad language. The track {{was inspired by}} Bootsy Collins and initially {{was going to be}} an instrumental. [...] "Do It, Do It" [...] was developed in DJ Codemoney's basement when he was working on a break involving Funkadelic's song [...] "You'll Like It Too". The song samples the nursery rhyme [...] "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" [...] taken from a children's record. [...] "Dedication to All B-Boys" [...] was inspired by the group The Commodores. The track features a Weaver's disc jockey, DJ Codemoney, performing a long break at the end. Weaver explained this part of the song by stating that in [...] "rock and funk groups, everybody who was part of the band got to do <b>their</b> <b>thing.</b> And Code was part of the band." ...|$|E
500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing <b>their</b> <b>thing,</b> but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E

500|$|Hundreds {{of musicians}} have been {{inspired}} by the album. Pianist Lafayette Gilchrist states that Money Jungle was the first jazz album that he bought, and that it [...] "sounds like an orchestra being played by a trio. I was inspired to make something [...] big and grandiose just like that". Drummer Jeff [...] "Tain" [...] Watts observed that the members of the trio were [...] "doing <b>their</b> <b>thing,</b> but they’re together", and compares this with later groups led by Keith Jarrett and Wayne Shorter, stating that the later groups [...] "have a much freer way of doing it, but everybody's kind of in their own zone and yet they’re [...] definitely [...] playing [...] the [...] composition in tune with each other, just like Duke and Max and Mingus were doing on Money Jungle." [...] Trumpeter Miles Davis had a different view of the session: in a 1964 Down Beat blind listening test, he criticised the record company for putting the three musicians together, saying that [...] "Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves. Mingus is a hell of a bass player, and Max is a hell of a drummer. But Duke can't play with them, and they can't play with Duke." ...|$|E

2500|$|Asked about {{influencing}} a {{new generation}} of bands, Jones stated [...] "There's a few bands, like the 1D boys, and they're all getting to that age where Busted or McFly was the first gig they ever went to. It's really nice to see that bands are taking influence from what you do." [...] He continued, [...] "to actually see people in bands picking up guitars and doing <b>their</b> <b>thing</b> – any musical influence that we can give them – is amazing to see." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Brando {{appeared}} in The Missouri Breaks {{with his friend}} Jack Nicholson. The movie also reunited the actor with director Arthur Penn. As biographer Stefan Kanfer describes, Penn had difficulty controlling Brando, who seemed intent on going over the top with his border-ruffian-turned-contract-killer Robert E. Lee Clayton: [...] "Marlon made him a cross-dressing psychopath. Absent for the first hour of the movie, Clayton enters on horseback, dangling upside down, caparisoned in white buckskin, Littlefeather-style. He speaks in an Irish accent for no apparent reason. Over the next hour, also for no apparent reason, Clayton assumes the intonation of a British upper-class twit and an elderly frontier woman, complete with a granny dress and matching bonnet. Penn, who believed in letting actors do <b>their</b> <b>thing,</b> indulged Marlon all the way." [...] Critics were unkind, with The Observer calling Brando's performance [...] "one of the most extravagant displays of grandedamerie since Sarah Bernhardt", while The Sun complained, [...] "Marlon Brando at fifty-two has the sloppy belly of a sixty-two-year-old, the white hair of a seventy-two-year-old, {{and the lack of}} discipline of a precocious twelve-year-old." [...] However, Kanfer noted: [...] "Even though his late work was met with disapproval, a re-examination shows that often, {{in the middle of the}} most pedestrian scene, there would be a sudden, luminous occurrence, a flash of the old Marlon that showed how capable he remained." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1983, {{a sports}} writer noted: [...] "These {{days in the}} Oakland Coliseum, where the Athletics do <b>their</b> <b>thing,</b> the phrase is 'Computer Ball' [...] as {{programmed}} by Martin's successor, Steve Boros." [...] In May 1983, Newsweek published a story on Boros's pioneering use of the computer titled [...] "The Computers of Summer." [...] In a June 1983 feature story titled [...] "It's the Apple of His Eye", Sports Illustrated wrote that Boros made access to a computer a condition of his hiring and used an Apple II, loaded with pitch-by-pitch data from the 1981 and 1982 seasons, as a scouting tool. The article's author opined: [...] "Though traditionalists may shudder at the thought, {{it was inevitable that}} such a stat-happy pursuit as baseball would plug into a data bank. And Boros, 46, a Michigan grad who plans to take classes in computer science during the off-season, is in the forefront of a new wave of enlightened technocrats who are rewiring the game." [...] However, Boros tried to downplay his reliance on the computer, noting, [...] "We're not down in the dugout frantically leafing through pages of computer printouts. I'm too busy watching my pitchers for signs of fatigue or checking my base runners — all the little nuances and gut feelings that you get and no computer can pick up. However, I do study the printouts before each game." ...|$|E
60|$|Whether the {{institution}} to be defended is slavery, political absolutism, or the absolutism {{of the head}} of a family, we are always expected to judge of it from its best instances; and we are presented with pictures of loving exercise of authority on one side, loving submission to it on the other--superior wisdom ordering all things for the greatest good of the dependents, and surrounded by their smiles and benedictions. All this would be very much to the purpose if any one pretended that there are no such things as good men. Who doubts that there may be great goodness, and great happiness, and great affection, under the absolute government of a good man? Meanwhile, laws and institutions require to be adapted, not to good men, but to bad. Marriage is not an institution designed for a select few. Men are not required, as a preliminary to the marriage ceremony, to prove by testimonials that they are fit to be trusted with the exercise of absolute power. The tie of affection and obligation to a wife and children is very strong with those whose general social feelings are strong, and with many who are little sensible to any other social ties; but there are all degrees of sensibility and insensibility to it, as there are all grades of goodness and wickedness in men, down to those whom no ties will bind, and on whom society has no action but through its ultima ratio, the penalties of the law. In every grade of this descending scale are men to whom are committed all the legal powers of a husband. The vilest malefactor has some wretched woman tied to him, against whom he can commit any atrocity except killing her, and, if tolerably cautious, can do that without much danger of the legal penalty. And how many thousands are there among the lowest classes in every country, who, without being in a legal sense malefactors in any other respect, because in every other quarter their aggressions meet with resistance, indulge the utmost habitual excesses of bodily violence towards the unhappy wife, who alone, at least of grown persons, can neither repel nor escape from their brutality; and towards whom the excess of dependence inspires their mean and savage natures, not with a generous forbearance, and a point of honour to behave well to one whose lot in life is trusted entirely to their kindness, but on the contrary with a notion that the law has delivered her to them as <b>their</b> <b>thing,</b> to be used at their pleasure, and that they are not expected to practise the consideration towards her which is required from them towards everybody else. The law, which till lately left even these atrocious extremes of domestic oppression practically unpunished, has within these few years made some feeble attempts to repress them. But its attempts have done little, and cannot be expected to do much, because it is contrary to reason and experience to suppose that there can be any real check to brutality, consistent with leaving the victim still {{in the power of the}} executioner. Until a conviction for personal violence, or at all events a repetition of it after a first conviction, entitles the woman ipso facto to a divorce, or at least to a judicial separation, the attempt to repress these “aggravated assaults” by legal penalties will break down for want of a prosecutor, or for want of a witness.|$|E
