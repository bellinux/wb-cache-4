5000|$|The Admiralty's Landships Committee {{was created}} in 1915 to oversee the {{development}} of what would become known as tanks. In the same year, the Design Department was set up at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. The Tank and <b>Tracked</b> <b>Transport</b> Experiment Establishment (TTTEE) was formed at Farnborough in 1925, which in turn spawned the Mechanical Warfare Experimental Establishment (MWEE) in 1928. The MWEE was renamed the Mechanisation Experimental Establishment (MEE) in 1934 and in 1940 the MEE merged with elements of the Design Department at Woolwich to form the Department of Tank Design.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, many {{surviving}} ISU-122s were rebuilt as rocket launchers, {{very large}} calibre gun chassis or supply vehicles. The {{small number of}} ISU-122s that kept their original armament were modernized in 1958. This modernization was not as complete {{as that of the}} ISU-152. Most ISU-122s did not receive a new engine, only upgraded gun sights and radio sets. In the beginning of 1960, the ISU-122 was withdrawn from Soviet Army service (the ISU-152 served much longer). Some disarmed ISU-122s were transferred to civil organizations, to be used as emergency vehicles on Soviet railways or as <b>tracked</b> <b>transport</b> in Arctic areas of the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|After the {{prototype}} T-13 B1 passed all the {{tests of the}} Belgian Army, in 1935 production on the tank destroyer was authorized to proceed: the Miesse company near Buizingen (close to Brussels) delivered 32 T-13 B1s, all based on imported British built Vickers 1934 artillery tractors. The T-13 B2 model was a further development of the B1, but differs only slightly from the B1 model: most importantly the turret was redesigned to give the vehicle a somewhat lower frontal silhouette. All 21 (23 according to some sources) T-13 B2s were apparently converted from the earlier ordered Vickers artillery tractors for the Chasseurs Ardennais mountain troops, <b>tracked</b> <b>transport</b> of the M34 75mm Bofors mountain gun now {{passed on to the}} smaller but more economical Vickers/Familleureux utility tractor. T-13 B2 assembly ended by 1937.|$|E

50|$|DHL Express {{supports}} the carrier-independent ISO standard 15459-1 for {{the identification of}} single packages. Such identifiers consist of upper-case characters and numerals, {{and they can be}} up to 35 digits long. Companies that already use this standard do not require an additional identifier to track their pieces when shipping with DHL Express. In addition, DHL Express uses numeric identifiers of exactly ten digits to <b>track</b> <b>transport</b> orders (i.e. an order to transport a shipment consisting of one or more pieces from A to B). Customers can use both codes for tracking purposes.|$|R
50|$|With {{the end of}} the Sixties, the United States Army Military Police Corps {{expressed}} the need for a vehicle, capable of being transported by Lockheed C-130 aircraft, which was intended to provide base protection, as well as carrying out convoy escort duties. This eventually led to a formal requirement being issued in 1976. However the requirement was allowed to lapse, probably due to budgetary pressures of the time. Despite this, one of the firms that had expressed an interest in meeting the requirement, the Verne Corporation, decided to build two prototypes of a vehicle which was initially called the Verne Dragoon. These prototypes made their first public appearance in 1978. The Dragoon is of a very similar configuration to that of Cadillac Gage V-100 and the vehicles 4 X 4 general-purpose of the V-150 range, but it in common has several parts with the <b>tracked</b> <b>transport</b> of troops M-113A2 and the truck M-809 6 X 6 5 Ton.|$|E

500|$|In {{building}} the turnpike, boring the former railroad tunnels was completed. Since the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel bore was in poor condition, a new bore was drilled [...] to the south. The commission considered bypassing the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels, {{but the cost}} of a bypass was considered too high. Crews used steam shovels to widen the tunnels' portals, and temporary railroad <b>tracks</b> <b>transported</b> construction equipment in and out. Concrete was used in lining the tunnel portals. The tunnels include ventilation ducts, drainage structures, sidewalks, lighting, telephone and signal systems. Lighting was installed along the roadway approaching the tunnel portals.|$|R

As such, SCTP provides {{an alternative to the}} traditional transport protocols, TCP and UDP, that may be better able to satisfy the requirements of future battlefield networks. Unlike traditional transport protocols, SCTP allows multiple streams of messages within a single connection (or, in SCTP terminology, a single association). As the results in this paper show, this ability is particularly helpful in reducing latency for streaming multimedia in high loss environments...|$|R
