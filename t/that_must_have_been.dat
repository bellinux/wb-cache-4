5|$|Two other {{inscriptions}} of the Memphis decrees {{have been}} found since {{the discovery of the}} Rosetta Stone: the Nubayrah Stele, and an inscription found at the Temple of Philae (on the Philae obelisk). Unlike the Rosetta Stone, their hieroglyphic inscriptions were relatively intact. The inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone had been deciphered long before the discovery of the other copies of the decree, but subsequent Egyptologists, including Wallis Budge, used these other inscriptions to further refine the actual hieroglyphs <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used in the lost portions of the hieroglyphic register on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
25|$|Fear and Trembling (original Danish title: Frygt og Bæven) is an {{influential}} philosophical work by Søren Kierkegaard, published in 1843 under the pseudonym Johannes de silentio (John the Silent). Kierkegaard wanted {{to understand the}} anxiety <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present in Abraham when God asked him to sacrifice his son.|$|E

Most {{of the grave}} goods <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deposited there are long gone {{as a result of}} the tomb plundering. The few remaining items were a scepter, several arrows, and a collection of models including ships, granaries and bakeries.|$|E

25|$|Suppiluliuma then recounts how {{the land}} of Ishuwa on the upper Euphrates had seceded {{in the time of}} his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it had failed. In the time of his father, other cities had rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have {{defeated}} them, but the survivors had fled to the territory of Ishuwa, <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> part of Mitanni. A clause to return fugitives is part of many treaties between sovereign states and between rulers and vassal states, so perhaps the harbouring of fugitives by Ishuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion.|$|E
25|$|Pigs {{have been}} domesticated since ancient {{times in the}} Old World. Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that pigs were being managed in the wild in a way {{similar to the way}} they are managed by some modern New Guineans from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BP in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BP in Cyprus <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> introduced from the mainland which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. A separate domestication also occurred in China.|$|E
25|$|After adding only 7 in 11 {{balls on}} the fourth and final day, Essex {{declared}} on 401 for 4, batting on to score the extra bonus point before putting Yorkshire in. Yorkshire found it difficult on a pitch <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> affected by the rain. Whilst Yorkshire's captain, Craig White, resisted with 59 not out, the team disintegrated to 205, 196 behind. Essex enforced the follow-on, but in yet another rain-affected day, Yorkshire held on. Jaques scored 67 not out from 88 balls out of his team's 105 for 2. Essex scored maximum bonus points, but were denied by the weather. Yorkshire escaped with the draw, but were fined 0.5 points for a slow over rate during Essex' innings.|$|E

500|$|Miller was {{inspired}} {{to write about the}} Les Innocents Cemetery after reading historian Philippe Ariès's brief description of its clearing and imagining the theatrics <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> involved.

The novel was awarded the Costa Book Award 2011 for [...] "Best Novel" [...] and [...] "Book of the Year", and was nominated for the Walter Scott Prize and South Bank award.|$|E
500|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of the building work <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done in the early 1700s following a period of near-disuse {{and it may have}} been restricted to repairs. Substantial alterations in the 1760s and 1770s included the replacement and repitching of the great hall roof, the new gothic south window of the great hall complete with the ogee parapet above it and the provision of a ceiling within the hall. At the same time, the west wing façade was remodelled in [...] "Chinese Gothic" [...] style.|$|E

500|$|All four episodes were {{directed}} by Lee Salisbury, who learned {{three weeks before}} filming {{that he would be}} working on the episodes, and said he was [...] "a bit dumbstruck" [...] to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor's departure, but that he was proud to do so. He said his main aim for the fire was to show the fear, panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads. He wanted the story to be character-led rather than led by the fire, saying that the fire [...] "almost becomes a backdrop". Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire look real because [...] "you can't actually set fire to stuff". As the fire lasted for some time, characters' scenes could be divided up into small sections. Salisbury commented: [...] "Bryan Kirkwood, the writer [...] and myself also wanted it to be an episode where things kept happening and the audience would keep thinking, 'Wow, <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the explosion' or 'That must have been the stunt'. But more things keep happening and happening, and I think that's what people will find really shocking." [...] The production team had several production meetings for the weeks' worth of episodes, whereas there is usually just one.|$|E
2500|$|The {{in-depth}} study of Mishneh Torah underwent a revival in Lithuanian Judaism {{in the late}} 19th century. The Lithuanians did not {{use it as a}} source book on practical halakha, as they followed the Ashkenazi authorities such as Moses Isserles and the Aruch ha-Shulchan. [...] Instead they used it as a guide to Talmudic interpretation and methodology. [...] Given the fact that the Mishneh Torah entirely omits these topics, this reading seems paradoxical and against the grain. [...] Their method was to compare the Talmudic source material with Maimonides' final decision, in order to reconstruct the rules of interpretation <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to get from one to the other.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Shalmaneser I won a {{crushing}} victory for Assyria over the Hittites and Mitanni. He {{claims to have}} slain 14,400 men; the rest were blinded and carried away. His inscriptions mention the conquest of nine fortified temples; 180 Hurrian cities were [...] "turned into rubble mounds", and Shalmaneser [...] "…slaughtered like sheep the armies of the Hittites and the Ahlamu his allies…". The cities from Taidu to Irridu were captured, {{as well as all}} of mount Kashiar to Eluhat and the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates. Another inscription mentions the construction of a temple to the Assyrian god Adad/Hadad in Kahat, a city of Mitanni <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> occupied as well.|$|E

2500|$|Chad {{faced the}} same problem over {{ordination}} as Wilfrid, and so set off to seek ordination amid the chaos caused by the plague. Bede tells us that he travelled first to Canterbury, where he found that Archbishop Deusdedit was dead and his replacement was still awaited. Bede does not tell us why Chad diverted to Canterbury. The journey seems pointless, since the archbishop had died three years previously– a fact <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> well known in Northumbria, and was the very reason Wilfrid had to go abroad. The most obvious reason for Chad's tortuous travels would be that he was also on a diplomatic mission from Oswiu, seeking to build an encircling alliance around Mercia, which was rapidly recovering from its position of weakness. From Canterbury he travelled to Wessex, where he was ordained by bishop Wini of the West Saxons and two British, i.e. Welsh, bishops. None of these bishops was recognised by Rome. Bede points out that [...] "at that time {{there was no other}} bishop in all Britain canonically ordained except Wini" [...] and the latter had been installed irregularly by the king of the West Saxons.|$|E
2500|$|Bolland {{is noted}} by some for {{his use of}} bondage imagery, {{although}} in a humorous self-referential comment, he quotes this [...] "fact" [...] (cited as from Wikipedia), and states that he is [...] "unsure" [...] of the sentiment's accuracy. He notes that [...] "I can only think off-hand of a few occasions when I've drawn bondage. A few Wonder Woman covers perhaps, a Flash cover, a 2000 AD cover, a Mr. Mamoulian page... but that's all that I can remember out of many hundreds of images." [...] In 2006's The Art of Brian Bolland, he does suggest that [...] "I trace my mild bondage fetish back to a book of Bible stories <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given to my father as a Sunday school gift {{when he was a}} child," [...] wherein [...] "was a picture of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednigo [...]" [...] Such Biblical imagery was bolstered in 1971 by a book bought in Paris [...] "called Les Filles de Papier... large part of [...] was taken up with comic strips about women tied up in fiendish and excruciating positions by mad robots... it was just jaw-droppingly bonkers... and yet... there was something rather appealing about it." [...] The Art of Brian Bolland also features a separate [...] "Nudes" [...] section, mostly created for the purpose of [...] "trying out a different inking technique or trying to work out the figure from a difficult angle." [...] (Only three of the nude sketches involve scenes of bondage.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. <b>That</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
