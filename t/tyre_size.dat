50|$|Similar to the 2011 {{change for}} Formula 1, Pirelli {{is now the}} sole tyre {{supplier}} for the series. The GP2 Series runs the same compounds as F1. The front <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> are 245/660-R13 and rear <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> are 325/660-R13.|$|E
50|$|Hankook is {{currently}} the sole tyre supplier for the series since 2011 season until at least 2019. Previously Dunlop Tyres was the tyre supplier of DTM from 2000 to 2010. The DTM runs the bespoke compounds and size same as LMP and GT cars since 2000 and reprofiled in 2012. The front <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> are 300/680-R18 and rear <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> are 320/700-R18.|$|E

50|$|DMACK {{was founded}} in 2008 by Dick Cormack to deliver smaller <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> than the ones {{supplied}} by industry giants, such as Michelin and Goodyear, specifically for the rally market.|$|R
5000|$|Tyres: Type - Pneumatic tyres, {{front axle}} duplex tyres, middle and rear axle single <b>tyres.</b> <b>Size,</b> 270-20. Air {{pressure}} - Front axle, 4,8 atm.; Middle and rear axle, 5,8 atm.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{shape and}} styling of the MG ZT {{remained}} {{the same as for}} the Rover 75 but with changes to the front bumper, now with an integrated grille, and detail alterations including colour coding of the chromed waistline, a new bootlid plinth, and different alloy wheels and <b>tyres</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bus was 9.6 metres long, 4.4 metres {{in height}} and 2.5 metres wide. The {{standard}} <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> was 275/70R22.5, however the Baghdad example had 11R22.5 tyres.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the 2011 {{change for}} Formula 1, Pirelli {{is now the}} sole tyre {{supplier}} for the series. The FIA Formula 2 Championship runs the different compounds and size as F1 since 2017 (due to in fact Formula 1 2017 season tyres are wider, FIA Formula 2 Championship carried over the pre-2017 Pirelli F1 tyres). The front <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> are 245/660-R13 and rear <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> are 325/660-R13. The compounds of Pirelli Formula 2 tyres are 4 dry compounds and 2 wet compounds due to ultra soft only used in Formula One.|$|E
5000|$|Some wheels {{also have}} their {{diameter}} quoted in mm {{as opposed to}} inches ("metric" [...] wheels). An example of a typical <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> is 160/65r315, where '315' denotes the wheel diameter in mm.|$|E
50|$|The Belarusian tyre {{works is}} located in the Belarusian {{industrial}} city Babruysk. Belshina produces over 180 <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> for cars, trucks, mining trucks, road construction machinery, electrical vehicles, tractors and agricultural machinery. Over 90 per cent of tyres are radial. All types of products (pneumatic tyres) are protected by patents by two parameters: design and appearance. Belshina cooperate with partners from 36 countries.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the early}} {{motorcycle}} industry progressed, larger <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> accompanied larger engine displacements, {{so that by}} 1909-1914, 2+1/4 in section, 26 in diameter tyres were used on [...] motorcycles, and 2+3/8 to 2+1/2 in section tyres appeared on motorcycles with displacements over 350 cc. Indian tyres reached 3.0 × 28 in, giving even greater rider comfort but with a taller seat height.|$|R
50|$|In {{each group}} there were classes based on engine {{displacement}} (with a 1.4 equivalence factor for forced induction engines). Each class had different weight limits, maximum <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes,</b> etc. The most important classes for Group B were the 3000 cc class (2142.8 cc with turbo or supercharger), 960 kg minimum weight (Audi Quattro, Lancia 037) and 2500 cc (1785 cc), 890 kg (Peugeot 205 T16, Lancia Delta S4).|$|R
5000|$|As {{soon as the}} {{customer}} is given a choice either in the size / type of tyres fitted on the basic rim or a choice of rim and <b>tyre</b> <b>size,</b> the labelling information must be provided before sale.|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{is fully}} {{independent}} coil-sprung {{and of the}} double A-arm type. Optional mobility enhancements included run-flat inserts and a central tyre inflation system (CTIS). Quoted standard <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> for WTC variants is 37 × 25.50R 16.5, and for NTC variants is 285/70 R17.|$|E
50|$|The clutch is {{pneumatically}} operated. The gearbox is a non-synchronised six-speed ZF. In addition, the driven {{rear axle}} {{is equipped with}} an integrated two-speed reduction gear system. The <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> is 11.00-20". At least one KB-112 logging vehicle, made for A. Ahlström, was equipped with Sisu Nemo hydraulic transmission system for trailers.|$|E
5000|$|If a car has <b>tyres</b> in <b>size</b> of 205, {{they would}} be called kaks(i)sataaviitoset or kaks(i)sataaviitosia (often kaks(i)nollaviitoset' or kaks(i)nollaviitosia).|$|R
50|$|Steering is {{assisted}} by a hydraulic servo. Both axles are with single <b>tyres</b> <b>size</b> of 14.5-20". Fuel capacity is 210 litres. The direct current electrical system {{is equipped with}} an 840-Watt, 24-Volt generator. There are two 145 Ah batteries. A towing bracket at the rear end. A reconnaissance winch of 6.5-ton capacity and 60-metre cable length is mounted as standard {{and it can be}} used both in front and rear end of the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|In 1983 {{an attempt}} {{to keep pace with}} the hot {{hatchback}} market, the final version of the Alfasud Ti received a tuned 1490 cc engine developing 105 PS (77 kW). Named Quadrifoglio Verde (Green Cloverleaf), the model was also fitted with Michelin low-profile TRX tyres on metric rims (<b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> 190/55 VR 340 TRX) as well as an enhanced level of equipment.|$|E
5000|$|According to a sales {{brochure}} for the 1989 Lotus Elan, {{the ride}} and handling engineers at Lotus found that [...] "for a given vehicle weight, power and <b>tyre</b> <b>size,</b> a front-wheel-drive car was always faster over a given section of road." [...] However, this may only apply for cars with moderate power-to-weight ratio. According to road test with two Dodge Daytonas, one FWD and one RWD, the road layout is also important for what configuration is the fastest.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati 748 is {{identical}} {{in almost every}} way to the 916, both creations of Ducati in-house designer Massimo Tamburini, and both sharing some design elements with the Ducati Supermono. The only differences are rear <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> (180/55/17 {{as opposed to the}} 916's 190/50/17) and engine capacity (88 mm bore and 61.5 mm stroke) of [...] The engine's shorter piston stroke gives a higher rev ceiling of 11500 RPM, and the smaller pistons help the engine accelerate more quickly.|$|E
25|$|After the race, scrutineers {{examined}} {{the bulk of}} the field and Hunt was disqualified because his McLaren was found to be too wide and Lauda was declared the winner. One of the new rules for 1976 defined how wide a Formula One car could be based on the widest car of the 1975 season along with the new smaller <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes.</b> McLaren appealed on the basis of measuring the car when the tyres were still warm after the race and when they were cold stating Goodyear tyres expand during the race.|$|R
50|$|Under the bonnet {{only the}} {{original}} engine block and head must remain from the production car but engine revs {{are limited to}} 8500 RPM to aid reliability and reduce costs. Racing transmissions and suspensions could be incorporated, but the suspension had to remain true to the original design of the road going model. Closer racing was also engineered into the rules by having different weight limits for front- and rear-wheel drive, and by limiting overall wheel and <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> and by restricting each car to only six tyres per event.|$|R
50|$|The {{sponsors}} {{were very}} pleased with the publicity generated that year so for the 1963 Indianapolis 500 Crosthwaite produced the innovative Harvey Aluminium Special ‘roller skate car’ with the then pioneering smaller profile (12-inch diameter) and wide racing tyres (front 7 inches and rear 9 inches wide) and wheels. Because of the small size of the front wheels Crosthwaite had to work out a way to mount the front brakes inboard {{in order to get a}} reasonable size disc. It was the first time that this had been attempted. Mickey Thompson took five cars to Indianapolis. Two of the previous year's design with Chevrolet V8 engines and three 'roller skate' cars. One of the new cars, the Harvey Titanium Special, featured a lightweight titanium chassis. Formula 1 World Champion Graham Hill test drove one of the cars but decided not to race because commitments in Europe meant he had insufficient time to practice. Al Miller II raced one of the modified 1962 cars to 9th place despite only qualifying in 31st position. Duane Carter qualified one of the roller skate cars 15th but was only placed 23rd after an engine failure on the 100th lap. The small <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> and low car weights caused complaints amongst the old hands and owners, so for future races cars were restricted to minimum <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> and minimum car weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventionally}} designed chassis {{was made}} of channel section side members suitably braced by cross members.Suspension was by eight quarter-elliptic springs in front—four to each wheel giving independent front springing. Rear suspension was by ordinary half-elliptical springs to a beam axle. The single brake for the front wheels {{was a part of}} the differential unit. The rear brakes were on each wheel. Electrical equipment was six-volt and a five lamp set supplied with dip and switch control to the head lights was included. The <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> is 4+1/2 x 18 in.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice of}} front-wheel drive is {{unusual for a}} sports car, but {{according}} to Lotus sales literature, [...] "for a given vehicle weight, power and <b>tyre</b> <b>size,</b> a front wheel drive car was always faster over a given section of road. There were definite advantages in traction and controllability, and drawbacks such as torque steer, bump steer and steering kickback were not insurmountable." [...] This was the only front-wheel-drive vehicle made by Lotus. Every model made since the M100 Elan, such as the Lotus Elise, has been rear-wheel drive.|$|E
50|$|For the mid-1970s, F1 {{stipulated that}} the maximum {{width of the}} front wing was 1.5 m. Considering the needed room for the driver's feet, the {{steering}} mechanism, suspension and the normal front <b>tyre</b> <b>size,</b> this meant the front tyres projected above {{and out to the}} sides of the wing. P34's basic concept was to use a tyre that would be small enough to fit entirely behind the wing. This would have two effects; one would be to lower overall drag and thus improve speed on straights, and the other was to clean up overall aerodynamics so the rear wing would receive cleaner airflow.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mini V-brakes" [...] (or [...] "mini V's") are V-brakes with shorter arms, {{typically}} between 8 and 9 centimeters. This {{reduces the}} required cable pull, making them compatible with brake levers intended for cantilever brakes. Mini V-brakes retain advantages specific to V-brakes such as not requiring extra cable stops. On the downside, their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally {{make for a}} less forgiving setup: they can only accommodate smaller <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> compared to cantilever brakes, may pose problems for mounting fenders, can be clogged more easily by mud, and {{they can make it}} harder to change wheels.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the vehicle}} had power {{steering}} and a semi-automatic transmission (the transmission required no clutch pedal, but gears {{still had to}} be shifted by hand), though the shift lever controlled a powered hydraulic shift mechanism {{in place of a}} mechanical linkage, and a fibreglass roof which lowered the centre of gravity and so reduced weight transfer. Inboard front brakes (as well as independent suspension) reduced unsprung weight. Different front and rear track widths and <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> reduced the unequal tyre loading, which is well known to promote understeer, typical of front-engined and front-wheel drive cars.|$|R

5000|$|The Brompton {{folding bicycle}} and {{accessories}} are the company's core product, {{noted for its}} self-supporting compact size when stored. All available models of the folding bicycle {{are based on the}} same hinged bicycle frame and 16 inch (37×349 mm) bicycle wheel <b>tyre</b> <b>size.</b> Components are added, removed, or replaced by titanium parts to form the many variations. The modular design has remained fundamentally unchanged since the original patent was filed by Andrew Ritchie in 1979, with small details being refined by continual improvement. Ritchie was awarded the 2009 Prince Philip Designers Prize for work on the bicycle. [...] In reviews of folding bicycles, the Brompton is often the winner.|$|E
50|$|The {{engineering}} work began in 1978 {{in the main}} office of Sisu-Auto located then in Fleming Street, Helsinki. The project manager was Seppo Kokkola, the head engineer of the company. The other members were Kari Lindholm, Veli Vallinoja, Uoti Hartikainen and Kalevi Kakko who were the most notable engineers of Sisu-Auto. The starting point was NATO compatibility, which can be seen for instance on the <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> of 14.00-20 and the general looks of the vehicle. Building of the first prototype was started in November 1979 and the first test run was performed in the following February. In April the prototype was taken to Rovajärvi for field testing and in the following autumn began a half-year testing programme. The vehicle passed the tests of the Defence Forces.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the skin}} {{many of the}} {{components}} were beefed up with the rear suspension being derived from the E30 M3 and the front suspension and brake system being taken from the E36 M3 Evo. Based on the E36 platform, the Z3 Roadster was considered the E36/7 platform. The M Roadster could run a wider track under the flared wheel arches as well as wider wheels and tires to try to tame the increased power. Standard <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> for the M Roadster is 225/45r17 at the front and 245/40r17 at the back. The low offset of the rear wheels allows plenty of flexibility to increase the rear tire width. A dual exhaust system fed each set of three cylinders to two dual tailpipes. The Z3 M roadster was the first BMW to feature this quad exhaust design which has since become an BMW M division signature.|$|R

50|$|Pneumatic tyres {{were invented}} by John Boyd Dunlop in 1888, {{and were in}} {{widespread}} use on bicycles and some early motorcycle prototypes by 1895. They were used on the first production motorcycle, the 1894-1897 Hildebrand & Wolfmüller, and have been on nearly all production and special motorcycles ever since. During this period <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> were usually 22 to 28 in diameter and 1+1/2 to 2 in wide. The early wheels were spoked, made of all metal, or wood and metal, and used inner tubes to hold air. Flats were a constant problem; largely the fault of poor roads and not necessarily tyres. For easier repair, butt-ended or open ended inner tubes were used on some models, and some brands made rear wheels easier to detach. Spoked wheels with tubes remained standard until the 1970s, when solid, usually alloy, wheels began to appear and eventually dominate street motorcycles, making lighter tubeless tyres practical.|$|R
