5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E

5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 4000-3500 BC. By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BC there was {{a sharp increase in}} the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC. Studies of variation in genetic material shows <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> wild stallions, possibly all from a single haplotype, contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} was controversial in Lillehammer, both amongst {{the general public}} and politicians. The chief of administration had doubted whether he should recommend construction. The original plans had called for both a large and normal hill, but lack of funding meant that the normal hill was never built, meaning that the number of competitions in the hill would be severely limited. The cost overruns were largely created by errors in the plans, which estimated too little earthwork to fill the hillside, and not enough blasting. To cut costs, a floodlighting system was taken out of the plans, so the venue could not be used during the evenings, limiting the amount of time the venue could be used. It was also a concern <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> locals were able to jump on such a large hill. Many politicians stated in 1972 that the money should have been spent instead on an indoor hall for handball. The first trial jump was made by Helge Nordstrand, while Jan Stenbekk is credited with the first hill record, at 110.5meters.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} incident, the Army {{considered}} court-martialling several {{officers of the}} 157th Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Felix L. Sparks after servicemen were accused of massacring German soldiers who were surrendering at the Dachau concentration camp in 1945. Some of the German troops were camp guards; the others were sick and wounded troops from a nearby hospital. The soldiers of the 45th Division who liberated the camp were outraged at the malnourishment and maltreatment of the 32,000 prisoners they liberated, some barely alive, and all victims of the Holocaust. After entering the camp, the soldiers found boxcars filled with dead bodies of prisoners who had succumbed to starvation or last-minute executions, and in rooms adjacent to gas chambers they found naked bodies piled from the floor to the ceiling. The cremation ovens, which were still in operation when the soldiers arrived, contained bodies and skeletons as well. Some of the victims apparently had died only hours before the 45th Division entered the camp, while many others lay where they had died in states of decomposition that overwhelmed the soldiers' senses. Accounts conflict over what happened and over how many German troops were killed. After investigating the incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers involved, but Patton successfully intervened. Seventh Army was being disbanded and Patton had been appointed Military Governor of Bavaria, placing the matter in his hands. Some veterans of the 45th Infantry Division have said that only 30 to 50 German soldiers were killed and <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> were killed trying to surrender, while others have admitted to killing or refusing to treat wounded German guards.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to obtain reliable estimates concerning {{the number of children}} trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice. It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated.

As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{fish fauna}} was remarkably uniform, {{suggesting}} <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> families survived the Permian extinction. There were also {{many types of}} marine reptiles. These included the Sauropterygia, which featured pachypleurosaurus and nothosaurs (both common during the Middle Triassic, especially in the Tethys region), placodonts, and the first plesiosaurs. The first of the lizardlike Thalattosauria (askeptosaurs) and the highly successful ichthyosaurs, which appeared in Early Triassic seas soon diversified, and some eventually developed to huge size during the late Triassic. Subequatorial saurichthyids have also been described in Early Triassic strata.|$|E

It is found, however, <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few,</b> if any, languages are entirely one direction or the other.

25|$|There is no {{reliable}} worldwide database listing all cave diving fatalities.

25|$|Between October 2005 and November 2006, an {{experienced}} hacker {{broke into a}} university database containing approximately 800,000 files of personal information. Names, Social Security Numbers, and basic contact information was contained in these files, but banking numbers were not. On November 21, 2006, the system administrators noticed unauthorized activity and blocked further access to the database. While it was not conclusive whether the hacker used these records to commit identity theft or fraud, it was determined <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> records were actually accessed and even fewer specifics were obtained.|$|E
25|$|One {{intriguing}} fact is <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> fish remains {{are found}} among their middens. This {{has led to}} much speculation and argument.
