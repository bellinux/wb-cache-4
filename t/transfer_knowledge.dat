Early on pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to initiate new research programs on HIV/AIDS. Biotechnology companies lacked the necessary funds and expertise for such work. To address this issue, Haseltine suggested that NIAID create a special grant program to encourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to work on HIV related problems. Under this program a relatively large amount of money was granted to academic scientists provided that their laboratory have a pharmaceutical or biotechnology partner capable of translating knew knowledge to new drugs. The majority of the funds of these grants went to the industry partner to encourage {{the development of new}} drug research activities. These co-operative drug development grants led directly to the discovery of the protease inhibitors that changed the course of HIV/AIDS treatment and later to drugs that effectively target the integrase and envelope proteins.|$|E

The development of this application is encompassing four primary activities in developing an expert system, namely: knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, knowledge inferencing, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfering.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> acquisition is a process of acquisition or <b>transfering</b> <b>knowledge</b> or expertise of an expert through a knowledge engineer. Knowledge representation is a process of <b>transfering</b> <b>knowledge</b> into a computer based system. Knowledge inferencing is a reasoning process performed by an expert system to draw a conclusion or a final result. The reasoning process applies a forward-chaining method. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>transfering</b> is a process of <b>transfering</b> <b>knowledge</b> from an expert system to a user (non-expert one) through a user interface of the expert system. This expert system has been tested to about 300 users. This simple system generally runs quite well although there are still some weakness to refine in the further research. </p...|$|R

In the knowledge-based economy, more and more organisations have increasingly recognised and encouraged the value of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer.</b> However, there is sometimes a tendency to horde knowledge, perhaps through fear of losing power or through uncertainty over job security. In this paper, we consider the motivators of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> based on an empirical study carried out in part of a UK multinational, IBM Laboratories, in which the atmosphere appeared conducive to knowledge sharing, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> appeared voluntary and spontaneous.

40|$|There is {{a current}} debate in Swedish media {{regarding}} the {{negative aspects of}} Internet and social media, a debate which is also virtual in blogs and forums. This started with a post on the clothing company H&M’s Facebook page where a user was virtually attacked in an aggressive manner by other users. This kind of online behavior between customers {{can be seen as}} a new challenge for organizations, especially as social media is continuously growing.   We have investigated the area of misbehaving customers, also known as dysfunctional customer behavior, by looking into the theoretical area of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer.</b> Within <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> we have focused on the strategies codification, which concerns <b>transferring</b> <b>knowledge</b> from people-to-documents, and personalization, meaning <b>transferring</b> <b>knowledge</b> from people-to-people.   Previous studies within <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> has investigated this in relation to different contexts, including how different context affects the <b>transfer,</b> how <b>knowledge</b> is <b>transferred</b> between organizations or within specific industries or businesses. However, there is a lack of research regarding <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> in relation to customers misbehaving. Hence, the purpose of this study was to understand if and how organizations work with a codification and/or personalization strategy for <b>transferring</b> <b>knowledge</b> when handling dysfunctional customer behavior on social media. By comparing the organizations we investigated reasons and underlying factors for their way of <b>transferring</b> <b>knowledge.</b>   In order to fulfill the purpose we made a qualitative research with four companies that are active on social media. We conducted semi-structured interviews with respondents holding both managerial positions as well as with employees working practically with social media.   Our study showed that both codification and personalization are used as <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> strategies when dealing with customers that misbehave on social media. The codification strategy is pursued by the use of databases, information-systems, guidelines and documentation. These methods were used to make knowledge available for all employees and to make work more effective. The personalization strategy is followed by talking to each other in person, via telephone, email or chat. This <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> strategy was pursued to exchange ideas in order to receive input and advice from one another.   We also found that when dealing with customers behaving badly towards other customers on social media, personalization holds a higher usage than codification. Further our study showed that three underlying factors affect the usage of the codification and personalization strategy, namely, closeness, previous experience and available <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> sources...|$|R
40|$|The current {{understanding}} of {{when and how}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> leads to cross-border acquisition (CBA) success is still limited. The aims of the paper are to provide {{new insights into the}} factors that facilitate or impede <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer,</b> and to examine the impact of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> on CBA performance. The data were gathered via a cross-sectional survey using a questionnaire on a sample of UK firms that had acquired North American and European firms. The findings indicate that <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> and employee retention have positive influence on CBA performance. In addition, organizational culture differences have a negative influence on CBA performance, but also mediate the relationship between <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> and CBA performance. No direct or mediating effect of national cultural distance has been found on <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> and CBA performance. One of the important contributions of the present paper is the development of a conceptual framework incorporating the mediating effect of national cultural distance, organizational culture differences, and employee retention on <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> and acquisition performance. Moreover, we have tested the two distinct types of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> namely <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> in the functional area and <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> in the general management area, thus making a contribution to the existing literature on <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> in CBAs...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a case study}} on inter-organizational <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer.</b> The organizations involved are Peace Corps Macedonia and YMCA Bitola.

Literature regarding factors that affect inter-organizational <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> is reviewed and a model of inter-organizational project <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> proposed by Easterby-Smith et al. (2008) is adopted. An analysis of the case finds factors that may {{have a negative impact}} on successful <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> include motivation discrepancies of key actor groups. The analysis also finds unique methods being employed as part of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> design may have a positive effect on inter-organizational <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer.</b> These include the placement of a Peace Corps volunteer with the project receiving organization, and the gradual <b>transfer</b> of <b>knowledge</b> design which takes place over multiple cycles of the same projects. Recommendations for Peace Corps Macedonia and YMCA Bitola include ensuring motivation alignment among local Macedonian volunteers and Peace Corps volunteers. Recommendations for similar projects include the placement of a Peace Corps volunteer with the project receiving organization and consideration of a gradual <b>transfer</b> of <b>knowledge</b> design. Limitations of this study include the lack of generalizability of this study, the lack of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> literature focusing on public sector inter-organizational <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer,</b> and issues related to analyzing an in-progress <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer.</b> Suggested areas for future research include factors that affect inter-organizational <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> in the public sector and further exploration of the effects of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> design employed in this case study...|$|R

In the <b>knowledge</b> era, <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> between the instructor and learners is important since the goal of educational system is the learners gain the knowledge from the process of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> by the instructor. Studies have shown that <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> can be problematic, and an effective <b>transfer</b> of <b>knowledge</b> can be difficult. The difficulty arises when the <b>transferred</b> <b>knowledge</b> becomes ambiguous, disrupted (hence incomplete), and distributed all over (making it difficult to link them together). Four hypotheses were formulated {{to examine the relationship between}} key characteristics of knowledge and learning outcome. The findings revealed some significant results involving the key characteristics of knowledge. The implication from this study can contribute much to the instructor and learners in knowing what knowledge that the instructor can transfer to learners and what knowledge is gained by learners as learning outcome. In addition, the learning outcome can tell the instructor to search for the right methodologies for improving the <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> to learners...|$|R
