25|$|When Qabbani was 15, his sister, who was 25 at the time, {{committed}} suicide because {{she refused to}} marry a man she did not love. During her funeral he decided to fight the social conditions he saw as causing her death. When asked whether he was a revolutionary, the poet answered: “Love in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> like a prisoner, and I want to set (it) free. I want to free the Arab soul, sense and body with my poetry. The relationships {{between men and women}} in our society are not healthy.” He is {{known as one of the}} most feminist and progressive intellectuals of his time.|$|E
25|$|Cheek kissing in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} common, between {{friends and}} relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between {{a male and}} female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and sister, or if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities {{in some of the}} more liberal Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia, where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the Arab diaspora. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: one on the left cheek, then right, and then left between relatives. In other countries, it is typically two kisses with one on each cheek.|$|E

They also argue that most of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> composed of entirely Arab and Muslim states, with many countries not granting equality for ethnic or religious minorities.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{recognisable}} family {{consists of}} the Iraqi (Mosul and Iraqi diaspora), Spanish-Moroccan and Spanish and Portuguese melodies. [...] The probable reason for the occurrence of similar melodies {{at opposite ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> that they represent the remains of an old Arab-Jewish tradition not overlaid by the later Ottoman-Sephardic tradition that spread to the countries in between. [...] There may also have been some convergence between the London Spanish and Portuguese and Iraqi melodies during British rule in India and the British Mandate of Mesopotamia.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{challenge}} {{the assumption that}} civil society in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> weak, pointing to the flourishing of civil society activity visible when regimes permit a degree of liberalization, which in turn permits civil society to make further demands for political opening. Western donors should therefore not focus solely on creating demand for democracy on a societal level, but also on encouraging policy reform that would expand political competition by [...] "putting a stop to legislative manipulation aimed at maintaining state and government control over NGOs" [...] and [...] "allowing a revival of politics {{in a society where}} a correct political life has been stifled by the state." ...|$|E

[...] "While <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> a rich prize in itself, Europe has been and remains the primary objective. A strong Soviet power position in the Mediterranean, supported by a string of client states along its southern shore, would give the Russians not only control of key resources essential to the European economy, but positions from which to menace the flow of shipping on which that economy's survival depends."

2500|$|Larbi Sadiki {{suggested}} that although [...] "conventional wisdom {{has it that}} 'terror' in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> monopolised by al-Qaeda in its various incarnations", {{there was also the}} fact that [...] "regimes in countries like Tunisia and Algeria have been arming and training security apparatuses to fight Osama bin Laden [...] were [...] caught unawares by the 'bin Laden within': the terror of marginalisation for the millions of educated youth who make up {{a large portion of the}} region's population. The winds of uncertainty blowing in the Arab west – the Maghreb – threaten to blow eastwards towards the Levant as the marginalised issue the fatalistic scream of despair to be given freedom and bread or death." [...] A similar opinion by Lamis Ardoni carried by Al Jazeera said that the protests had [...] "brought down the walls of fear, erected by repression and marginalisation, thus restoring the Arab peoples' faith in their ability to demand social justice and end tyranny." [...] He also said that the protests that succeeded in toppling the leadership should serve as a [...] "warning to all leaders, whether supported by international or regional powers, that they are no longer immune to popular outcries of fury" [...] even though Tunisia's ostensible change [...] "could still be contained or confiscated by the country's ruling elite, which is desperately clinging to power." [...] He called the protests the [...] "Tunisian [...] which had [...] "placed the Arab world at a crossroads." [...] He further added that if the change was ultimately successful in Tunisia it could [...] "push the door wide open to freedom in Arab word [...] If it suffers a setback we shall witness unprecedented repression by rulers struggling to maintain their absolute grip on power. Either way, a system that combined a starkly unequal distribution of wealth with the denial of freedoms has collapsed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friedman {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that {{the establishment of}} a democratic state in the Middle East would force {{other countries in the region}} to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: [...] "The French position is utterly incoherent. The inspections have not worked yet, says Mr. de Villepin, because Saddam has not fully cooperated, and, therefore, we should triple the number of inspectors. But the inspections have failed not because of a shortage of inspectors. They have failed because of a shortage of compliance on Saddam's part, as the French know. The way you get that compliance out of a thug like Saddam is not by tripling the inspectors, but by tripling the threat that if he does not comply he will be faced with a U.N.-approved war." [...] Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair [...] for [...] "hyping" [...] the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy [...] "would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate.com called [...] "Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: [...] "The right reason for this war.. was to oust Saddam's regime and partner with the Iraqi people to try to implement the Arab Human Development report's prescriptions in the heart of the Arab world. That report said <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> falling off the globe because of a lack of freedom, women's empowerment, and modern education. The right reason for this war was to partner with Arab moderates in a long-term strategy of dehumiliation and redignification.|$|E

Magazines in the Arab world, {{like many of}} the magazines in the Western world, are geared towards women.
