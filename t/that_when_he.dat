She is a Paladin and had to either kill David or leave. After leaving her house, David meets with Millie outside, and they jump to an unknown location.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to see}} the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
6000|$|... "He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> drunk. He's {{the best}} naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober." ...|$|R

50|$|After Frank's victory, Leo and Rocky {{are seen}} talking with their boss Dutch Genderson, who tells them <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> through with Frank, Frank will be dead.|$|R
5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E
5|$|At dinner, Lord Tywin {{tells his}} son Tyrion that Tyrion and his barbarian allies will {{fight in the}} vanguard of the army. Tyrion {{suspects}} his father is trying to get him killed. Tyrion returns to his camp and finds the prostitute Shae whom Bronn found for him at Tyrion's request. As the three of them swap stories, Tyrion reveals <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was 16, he married a woman named Tysha whom Jaime and he had rescued. When his father Tywin learned of this, he made Jaime confess that Tysha was actually a hired prostitute. Tywin then made Tyrion watch as Lannister guardsmen all had sex with her, each paying her one silver coin provided by Lord Tywin.|$|E
5|$|Behan testified <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> searched Tom McLaury for {{a weapon}} {{prior to the}} gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> {{considered}} police protocol {{in responding}} to robberies, {{the location of the}} bank and their containment of roads he realized he needed a good getaway plan. <b>That’s</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> decided on using the local river to escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said, frowning, [...] "I'll go; {{but it must}} be {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> beaten you won't decide what's to be done with the man without consulting me." ...|$|R
50|$|And <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{started writing}} out scenes and {{dialogue}} {{which he would}} enact {{within the confines of}} his room. Soon it led to the discovery that inside him was a capable storyteller.|$|R
5|$|Born to {{a working-class}} Italian American family in Dudley, Massachusetts, {{he was raised}} Roman Catholic {{although}} became interested in esotericism as a teenager. He later claimed <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was 21, relatives initiated him into a tradition of witchcraft inherited from their Sicilian ancestors; this conflicts with other statements that he made, {{and there is no}} independent evidence to corroborate his claim. During the 1950s, he was based in New York City, where he worked as a graphologist and hypnotist. After beginning to publish books on paranormal topics in the early 1960s, he publicly began identifying as Wiccan in 1969, and stated that he was involved in a New York coven.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{later told}} a BBC {{documentary}} {{that he had}} not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.|$|E
5|$|Chamakh {{was born}} in Tonneins, a small town near the Garonne River, to Moroccan parents, and {{was raised in the}} nearby commune of Aiguillon. His father, El Mostafa Chamakh, was a former footballer in Morocco and played for club Difaâ Aïn Sbaâ in Casablanca. In 1979, he left Morocco to locate more {{favorable}} living conditions and to find a better job. After settling in France and finding work as a stonemason, the elder Chamakh brought his family over soon after. Chamakh's younger brother Yassin owns a café. Chamakh has stated <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> goes back home, he often waits tables to help out his brother.|$|E
50|$|<b>That's</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> meets Rocky who {{agrees to}} act as his pseudo wife in {{exchange}} for a “talent fee.” With Rocco's tempting offer and Rocky's need for money, the two seal the deal.|$|R
5000|$|For the National Games in 1970, Murillo Toro, who at {{the time}} was named St. Boniface, was the subject of his first spare and <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had the best {{infrastructure}} to house the first national fair.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] {{she says}} to her Ambassador: [...] "They're not coming. You just take my card and tell the King <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> got {{a few minutes to}} spare I'll be pleased to see him." ...|$|R
5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|He adopted {{his crew}} cut hair style while {{serving in the}} United States Marine Corps. Carey has had {{refractive}} surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! he revealed <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Keith ends his {{relationship}} with Wallace's mother Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) to give Lianne a second chance. Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the evidence against him. Logan then explains <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's only a {{theoretical}} delicacy which never means much. When a girl is engaged {{she likes to}} have the day fixed. When there's a long interval the man can do pretty much as he pleases, while the girl can do nothing except think about him. Then it sometimes turns out <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> wanted, he's not there." ...|$|R

50|$|Dohler {{was born}} in Baltimore, Maryland. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> was a child, his mother bought him a film {{projector}} and one day he drew stick figures {{on a piece of}} scotch tape. He ran the tape through the projector and just before the tape burned up inside of the projector, he saw the animated figure dance on the wall and <b>that’s</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> knew he wanted to make films.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{has been}} having drug-like {{withdrawals}} since Lois decided to wean him. He becomes so desperate <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and Lois {{are at the}} park, he jumps on a woman breastfeeding her baby and greedily suckles on her, but is pulled off by Lois. One night, he then tries to milk Lois in her sleep. He pumps her breasts and succeeds, but spills and desperately tries licking it up. Stewie realizes how pathetic he is and accepts his weaning. He comes to Brian and informs {{that he is now}} off breast milk, but Lois has other plans. Lois allows Stewie to be breastfed again, thus delighting him.|$|E
5|$|Olajuwon {{emigrated from}} Nigeria to play {{basketball}} at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis. Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered {{a visit to the}} university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.|$|E
5|$|Penrose {{originally}} {{discovered the}} P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one {{half of a}} net of a dodecahedron) and five half-diamonds; he then observed <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons. By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained {{one of the two}} P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.|$|E

5|$|Stacy Carter met Jerry Lawler, {{her future}} husband, at a charity {{softball}} game at Treadwell High School in Memphis on July 23, 1989, {{two months before}} her nineteenth birthday. She was attending the game with her mother, who was dating {{one of the players}} on the team for which Lawler also played. Lawler, however, was married at the time, and he claims <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> initially met Carter, he considered an affair. After Lawler separated from his wife, Carter moved in with him. When Carter first met Lawler, she was working as a bank teller. Lawler later helped her get a job at a photography studio, and she also opened and ran her own hair salon.|$|E
5|$|The Lindley Library, {{the largest}} horticultural library {{in the world}} and named after the British {{botanist}} John Lindley (1799–1865), was established in 1868 by the acquisition of Lindley's 1,300 volumes upon his death. It had recently undergone considerable change. In 1930, the library had been rehoused in a new floor added to the Society's Vincent Square headquarters, but the role of the library was somewhat downgraded. Frederick Chittenden had been appointed as Keeper of the Library (1930–1939), and Hutchinson reported directly to him. Stearn related <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> reported for duty, Hutchinson was completely unaware of the appointment of his new assistant.|$|E
5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire stated <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{drove away}} from Banbridge in the lead, {{a few minutes}} ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
