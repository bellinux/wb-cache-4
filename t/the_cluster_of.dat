This package includes the implementation for two such <b>clustering</b> procedures: (1) <b>the</b> <b>Clustering</b> <b>of</b> Linear Models (CLM) method, and (2) <b>the</b> <b>Clustering</b> <b>of</b> Linear Mixed Models (CLMM) method...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{distinct}} but related clustering problems with microarray data.

Also, in the first problem, we may wish first to summarize the information in the very large number <b>of</b> genes by <b>clustering</b> them into groups (of hyperspherical shape), which can be represented by some metagenes, such as the group sample means. We can then carry out <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tissues in terms of these metagenes. We focus here on mixtures of normals to provide a model-based <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> tissue samples (gene signatures) and of gene pro files...|$|R

5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognjište {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E

40|$|We measure <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> X-ray, radio, and mid-IR-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) at 0. 2 < z < 1. 2 using multi-wavelength {{imaging and}} spectroscopic {{redshift}}s from the PRIMUS and DEEP 2 redshift surveys, covering 7 separate fields spanning ~ 10 square degrees. Using the cross-correlation of AGN with dense galaxy samples, we measure <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> scale length and slope, {{as well as}} the bias, of AGN selected at different wavelengths. Similar to previous studies, we find that X-ray and radio AGN are more clustered than mid-IR-selected AGN. We further compare <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> each AGN sample with matched galaxy samples designed to have the same stellar mass, star formation rate, and redshift distributions as the AGN host galaxies and find no significant differences between their <b>clustering</b> properties. <b>The</b> observed differences in <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> AGN selected at different wavelengths can therefore be explained by <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> differences <b>of</b> their host populations, which have different distributions in both stellar mass and star formation rate. Selection biases inherent in AGN selection, therefore, determine <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> observed AGN samples. We further find no significant difference between <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> obscured and unobscured AGN, using IRAC or WISE colors or X-ray hardness ratio.

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> {{thunderstorms}} was tracking through Missouri, a {{new line}} of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, demarcating a dry line boundary. Although linear storm systems tend to indicate strong wind events and not tornadoes, these storms tracked eastward into southwestern Missouri and eventually produced several tornadoes. A long-tracked EF3 developed from one of these supercells and struck Cincinnati, Arkansas. At 13:31UTC on December31, a tornado watch was issued for much of Missouri and portions of Arkansas and Illinois. Most of the tornadoes during the outbreak stemmed from this line of storms as they moved through Missouri and Illinois throughout the day. At around noon, a new cluster of disorganized showers formed over eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Although these storms were initially weak, they gradually intensified into supercells as the day went on. Additional supercells quickly developed over Louisiana and eventually spread in coverage over Mississippi, resulting in the development of several tornadoes. Reaching their peak strength over Mississippi, the storms gradually lost their intensity as they tracked eastward late on December31 and into January1, 2011. By the morning hours of January1, severe activity had become restricted to the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama; the last tornado watch issued in association with the 2010New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was issued for those regions at 15:56UTC that day.|$|E

40|$|We study {{analytically}} {{the possibility}} that mergers of haloes are more highly <b>clustered</b> than <b>the</b> general population of haloes of comparable masses. We begin by investigating predictions for merger bias within the extended Press-Schechter formalism and discuss some limitations and ambiguities of this approach. We then postulate that mergers occur whenever two objects form within a (small) fixed distance of each other. We therefore study <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> pairs of points for a highly biased population in the linear regime, for the overall mass distribution in the quasilinear regime, and (using <b>the</b> halo model <b>of</b> <b>clustering)</b> in <b>the</b> nonlinear regime. Biasing, quasilinear evolution, and nonlinear clustering all lead to nonzero reduced (or connected) three-point and four-point correlation functions. These higher-order correlation functions can in many cases enhance <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> close pairs of points relative to <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> individual points. If close pairs are likely to merge, then <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> mergers may be enhanced.

40|$|Summary. In <b>the</b> {{framework}} <b>of</b> <b>clustering,</b> <b>the</b> usual {{aim is to}} cluster {{observations and}} not variables. However <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>clustering</b> variables clearly appears for di-mension reduction, selection of variables or in some case studies. A simple approach for <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> variables could be to construct a dissimilarity matrix between the variables and to apply classical clustering methods. But specific methods {{have been developed for}} <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> variables. In this context center-based cluster-ing algorithms have been proposed for <b>the</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> quantitative variables. In this article we extend this approach to categorical variables. The homogeneity crite-rion <b>of</b> a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> categorical variables is based on correlation ratios and Multiple Correspondence Analysis is used to determine the latent variable <b>of</b> each <b>cluster.</b> A simulation study shows that the method recovers well <b>the</b> underlying simulated <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> variables. Finally an application on a real data set also highlights the practical benefits of the proposed approach. Key words: <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> variables, center-based <b>clustering</b> algorithm, latent vari-able, Multiple Correspondence Analysis. ...|$|R

25|$|When {{a cluster}} of microparticles are trapped within a {{monochromatic}} laser beam, {{the organization of the}} microparticles within the optical trapping is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such we can say that <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding forces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.|$|E

25|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{was included in}} the DSM-III (1980), mainly due to the relatively large numbers of American combat veterans of the Vietnam War who were seeking treatment for the lingering effects of combat stress. In the 1980s, various researchers and clinicians suggested that PTSD might also accurately describe the sequelae of such traumas as child sexual abuse and domestic abuse. However, it was soon suggested that PTSD failed to account for <b>the</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> symptoms that were often observed in cases of prolonged abuse, particularly that which was perpetrated against children by caregivers during multiple childhood and adolescent developmental stages.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the diffuse, primitive, and classic amyloid-beta deposits was studied in the upper laminae of the superior frontal gyrus in cases of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Amyloid-beta-stained tissue was counterstained with collagen IV {{to determine whether the}} {{spatial distribution}} of the amyloid-beta deposits along the cortex was related to blood vessels. In all patients, amyloid-beta deposits and blood vessels were aggregated into distinct clusters and in many patients, <b>the</b> <b>clusters</b> were distributed with a regular periodicity along <b>the</b> cortex. <b>The</b> <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> diffuse and primitive deposits did not coincide with <b>the</b> <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> blood vessels in most patients.
