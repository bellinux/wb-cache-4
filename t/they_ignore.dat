5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts to charm some of the elderly women into doing his work fails miserably, as <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> him and all adore Andy.|$|E

25|$|While HSL, HSV, {{and related}} spaces serve well enough to, for instance, choose a single color, <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> {{much of the}} {{complexity}} of color appearance. Essentially, they trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, from a time in computing history (high-end 1970s graphics workstations, or mid-1990s consumer desktops) when more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive.|$|E
25|$|The vice counties, {{used for}} {{biological}} recording since 1852, are {{largely based on}} historic county boundaries. <b>They</b> <b>ignore</b> all exclaves and are modified by subdividing large counties and merging smaller areas into neighbouring counties; such as Rutland with Leicestershire and Furness with Westmorland. The static boundaries make longitudinal study of biodiversity easier. They also cover the rest of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Analysis {{is always}} an {{analysis}} ad infinitum and one can never reach the absolute. It consists in dividing the object based on the chosen viewpoint and translating the divided fragments into symbols, wherein a spectre of the original can be reconstructed. These symbols always distort {{the part of the}} object they represent, as they’re generalized to include it and every other part they represent. Thus <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> the object’s uniqueness.|$|E
25|$|Attentional control {{refers to}} an individual's {{capacity}} to choose what they pay attention to and what <b>they</b> <b>ignore.</b> The ability to regulate and direct attention releases the child from the constraints of only responding to environmental events, and means they are able actively to guide their attention towards the information-rich areas key for learning. For example, a number of authors {{have looked at the}} relationship between an infants' capacity to exercise attentional control and their subsequent performance during language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with right}} {{hemisphere}} brain damage often display sensory deficits such as left neglect, in which <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> {{everything in the}} left visual field. This neglect can be present throughout many daily activities including reading, writing and self-care activities. For example, individuals with left neglect typically leave out details on the neglected side of drawings or try to draw out all the details on the nonneglected side. Homonymous hemianopsia is another sensory deficit that is sometimes observed in this population.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} when Raghu's (Jai) parents move from Royapuram to Visalakshi Thottam, Chennai 600 028. Raghu {{is a member}} of the Royapuram Rockers Cricket team, and a college student living with his parents. He has no choice but to move with them {{although}} he detests the area. He is not very excited at the prospect of living in the same area as his sworn enemies. Raghu is faithful to his teammates, but <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> him because of the distance. Angered at being replaced by a new guy in the team in one of the matches, Raghu estranges himself from cricket and the Rockers.|$|E
25|$|Souls {{then begin}} cycles of reincarnation. It {{generally}} takes 10,000 {{years for a}} soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life {{three times in a}} row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. <b>They</b> <b>ignore</b> human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.|$|E

25|$|Buck's next {{owners are}} {{a trio of}} stampeders (Hal, Charles, and a woman named Mercedes from the United States), who are inexperienced at {{surviving}} in the Northern wilderness. They struggle to control the sled and ignore warnings that the spring melt poses dangers. They overfeed the dogs and then starve them when the food runs out. On their journey they meet John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs have been poorly treated and are in a weakened condition. He warns the trio against crossing the river, but <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> his advice and order Buck to move on. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses and continues to lie unmoving in the snow. After Buck is beaten by Hal, Thornton recognizes {{him to be a}} remarkable dog. Disgusted by the driver's treatment of Buck, Thornton hits Hal with the butt of his axe, cuts Buck free from his traces, and tells the trio he is keeping him, much to Hal's displeasure. After some argument, the trio leaves and tries to cross the river, but as Thornton warned, the ice breaks, and the three fall into the river and drown, along with the sled and neglected dogs.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs. Instead of a pitch, the films are connected {{by a group of}} three teenagers searching for the most banned film in the world, Movie 43, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of civilization. Calvin Cutler (Mark L. Young) and his friend J.J. (Adam Cagley) make a video in the style of MTV's Jackass and upload it on YouTube where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an April Fool's prank from Calvin's younger brother Baxter (Devin Eash), who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on Google, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with viruses from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the Internet. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich (Fisher Stevens) and a group of Chinese mobsters (Tim Chou and James Hsu) who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder (Nate Hartley), film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. <b>They</b> <b>ignore</b> his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only Movie 43, which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother (Beth Littleford) enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to flip out after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother. He also has visions, and finds semen from his erect crotch on his hand causing him to stare at his hand in shock and horror. Afterward, a deadly earthquake rumbles and mankind is lost. However, a few years later the only survivor, a crippled Calvin, finds Baxter's laptop still working despite viral infections. He watches the last remaining skits on the laptop. This version of the film was released in the U.S. as part of the Blu-ray Disc of Movie 43 as an unrated alternate cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|The Milton Keynes {{idea was}} very poorly {{received}} by Luton fans and viewed, in Bale's words, as [...] "tearing the club from its most loyal supporters". Luton fans held protest marches and rallies throughout the 1983–84 season, and chartered {{a plane to}} fly over Kenilworth Road during one match pulling a banner reading [...] "Keep Luton Town F.C. in Luton". Some 18,000 Luton residents signed a petition against the club leaving. A consortium of local businessmen attempted to persuade Vauxhall Motors, General Motors' Luton-based British marque, {{to invest in the}} club and help with a new stadium in Luton. In Milton Keynes, some residents expressed fears that Luton's arrival in central Milton Keynes might bring with it football hooliganism and threaten local amenities. Some Luton supporters boycotted the club's first home match of the 1984–85 season in protest against the Milton Keynes plans. The wide unpopularity of the proposed move and the consistently vehement opposition from Luton's local support combined to prevent it from occurring. [...] "The directors want our support and our money," [...] said Tom Hunt, a member of a Luton fans' action group against the move, [...] "but <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> the views of a community that wants to keep its football club. Why should fans pay at the turnstiles to help the club in business {{so that it can be}} taken away from us?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Thompson had {{concerns}} about federal judges deciding social {{policy in this}} area: [...] "Many federal judges seem intent on eliminating God from the public schools and the public square {{in ways that would}} astound our founding fathers.

2500|$|His anthropological {{views were}} laid out in [...] "The Activity Bias of Ethnography and the History of Society" [...] (1960).

As technology becomes more and more developed researchers all too often conclude that society is increasing in complexity. <b>They</b> <b>ignore</b> the possibility that activity expands at expense to experiential intricacy.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the beliefs}} {{ascribed}} to al-Qaeda members is the [...] that a Christian–Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam.
