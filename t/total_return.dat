25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007 Migden helped resolve a five-year- {{standoff}} between Marin county {{and the state of}} California regarding property taxes taken by the State and diverted to fund education deficits. With rising property tax values, the state decided to withhold an additional 4 million of county generated tax revenues to pay for programs for troubled children throughout California. Marin officials claimed the state was forcing the county to shoulder an unfair degree of state oriented funding. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed two bills pushed forward by Migden to resolve the issue. Migden's third bill passed and resulted in cutting the amount of surplus funds the county will annually pay to the state by half. The bill resulted in an extra 1.9million a year for Marin County and a <b>total</b> <b>return</b> of 24.7million to the area.|$|E

This {{would be the first}} of three 100-point {{milestones}} in 2013: 1,600 on May 3, 2013; 1,700 on August 1, 2013; and 1,800 on November 22, 2013. The S 500 closed out 2013 at a record high, finishing the December 31, 2013, trading day at 1,848.36. On May 23, 2014, the index for the first time closed above 1,900, at 1,900.53. On August 26, 2014, the index closed above 2,000 for the very first time, and on December 22 the S 500 climbed to 2078, an all-time high. The index closed on December 29 at 2,090.57 with a closing of 2,058.90 at the end of 2014. This was a gain of 85% (in price return, and 105% in <b>total</b> <b>return)</b> for the five years 2010–2014. On February 17, 2015, the index first closed above 2,100, closing at 2,100.34.

2500|$|The game {{began with}} the teams {{combining}} {{for a total of}} 24 first-quarter points, the most in Super Bowl history. The Packers then scored 17 unanswered points in the second quarter, including Favre's Super Bowl record 81-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman (this record was broken later, by Jake Delhomme and Muhsin Muhammad in Super Bowl XXXVIII). [...] In the third quarter, the Patriots cut the lead to 27–21 off of running back Curtis Martin's 18-yard rushing touchdown. But on the ensuing kickoff, Desmond Howard returned the ball a then-Super Bowl record 99 yards for a touchdown. The score proved to be the last one, as both teams' defenses took over the rest of the game. Howard became the first special teams player ever to be named Super Bowl MVP. He gained a total of 154 kickoff return yards, and also recorded a Super Bowl record 90 punt return yards, thus tying the Super Bowl records of <b>total</b> <b>return</b> yards (244) and combined net yards gained (244).|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} inflation-indexed bonds, {{fixed-income}} securities {{linked to a}} specific price index. The most common examples are US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and UK Index Linked Gilts. The interest and principal repayments under this type of bond are adjusted in line with a Consumer Price Index (in the US this is the CPI-U for urban consumers). This means that these bonds are guaranteed to outperform the inflation rate (unless (a) the market price has increased so that the [...] "real" [...] yield is negative, which {{is the case in}} 2012 for many such UK bonds, or (b) the government or other issuer defaults on the bond). This allows investors of all types to preserve the purchasing power of their money even at times of high inflation. For example, assuming 3.88% inflation over the course of 1 year (just about the 56 year average inflation rate, through most of 2006), and a real yield of 2.61% (the fixed US Treasury real yield on October 19, 2006, for a 5 yr TIPS), the adjusted principal of the fixed income would rise from 100 to 103.88 and then the real yield would be applied to the adjusted principal, meaning 103.88 x 1.0261, which equals 106.5913; giving a <b>total</b> <b>return</b> of 6.5913%. TIPS moderately outperform conventional US Treasuries, which yielded just 5.05% for a 1 yr bill on October 19, 2006.|$|E
