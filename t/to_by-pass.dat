5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered {{by people who}} thought that animation was only for children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt. Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's cartoon and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with high interest, but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it Cartoon Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> a seven-minute short.|$|E
5|$|Although the PVA 13th Army had {{a nominal}} {{strength}} of 230,000 men, its actual strength {{during the battle}} could be as low as 150,000 men. The PVA 66th Corps, for example, had only 6,600 men per division {{at the start of}} the battle, as opposed to the expected 10,000 men per division. There were also only one firearm available for every three Chinese soldiers, and the rest were employed as grenade throwers. Because most of the Chinese howitzers and guns were left behind in Manchuria, mortars were the only artillery support available for the Chinese. For the counteroffensive, the average Chinese soldier were issued with only five days worth of rations and ammunition, and resupply could only be obtained by scavenging on the battlefield. To compensate for its shortcomings, the Chinese relied extensively on night attacks and infiltrations in order to avoid the UN firepower. The primitive logistics system had also allowed the Chinese to maneuver over the rough hilly terrains, thus enabled them <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> the UN defenses and to surround the isolated UN positions. Because the Chinese had captured large numbers of Nationalist weapons during the Chinese Civil War, most of the Chinese weapons were composed of US made small arms such as the Thompson submachine gun, the M1 Garand rifle, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, the bazooka and the M2 mortar.|$|E

25|$|Mindful of {{this and}} other {{strategic}} considerations, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was planning <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> the city. At this time, Parisians started a general strike on 15 August 1944 that escalated into a full-scale uprising of the FFI a few days later. As the Allied forces waited near Paris, de Gaulle and his Free French government put General Eisenhower under pressure. De Gaulle was furious about the delay and was unwilling to allow the people of Paris to be slaughtered as {{had happened in the}} Polish capital of Warsaw during the Warsaw uprising. De Gaulle ordered General Leclerc to attack single-handedly without the aid of Allied forces. Eventually, Eisenhower agreed to detach the 4th US Infantry Division in support of the French attack.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to the {{substantive}} rank of lieutenant general on 23 May 1873 {{and to the}} local rank of full general on 22 March 1876, Haines became Commander-in-Chief, India in April 1876, with promotion to brevet full general on 1 October 1877. He commanded the forces in India during the Second Anglo-Afghan War and successfully argued for a large force being made available before mobilisation occurred, but once the war started the Governor-General of India, Lord Lytton, was inclined <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> Haines and deal direct with commanders in the field, causing friction between the two men. Haines was offered a baronetcy for services to HM Government in India in 1880 but declined the honour due to his wife's failing health, presuming {{that it would be}} re-offered to him after her recovery. However, her health declined and she eventually died and the offer of the baronetcy was never renewed.|$|E

25|$|The Blenheim {{campaign}} {{dominated the}} war in 1704. For Louis XIV, the defeat was a severe blow to his prestige, {{but there were some}} consolations that year, including the success of Marshals Montrevel and Villars against the Allied-backed Camisard revolt in the Cévennes (although a low-level guerilla war dragged on for several additional years). For Marlborough, the Blenheim campaign secured his reputation and was seen by many as a vindication of the continental strategy, but for England the pressing need now was for the Emperor to make peace in Hungary, and for the Allies to resume the attack against France on all fronts. However, Marlborough's attempt in 1705 <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> the Low Countries and invade Louis XIV's kingdom via the Moselle, proved a failure. With Villars entrenched at Sierck, and with the German princes failing to fully support the attack, the Duke was forced to return to the Meuse in mid-June. Little was achieved here, though, beyond forestalling a French offensive and forcing the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim, south of Zoutleeuw (Léau), on 17/18 July.|$|E
25|$|A few Hyderabads {{fell back}} to the next {{battalion}} (Lt.Col.Cecil Deakin's 5/2nd Punjab Regiment) alerting the Punjabis to the tanks heading towards their position. Shimada lost his two leading tanks to land mines and Boys anti-tank rifles {{in front of the}} more experienced Punjabi position. The Punjabis then managed to set fire to another tank with Molotov cocktails, effectively blocking the road and leaving the Japanese column stacked up, almost bumper to bumper. If the British artillery (who were not contacted due to the communication lines being cut) had been called in {{at this point in the}} battle, Shimada's column could have been easily stopped due to their stacked up and vulnerable position, surrounded by thick jungle on the narrow road. This golden opportunity for the British was lost and Shimada's infantry were able to push through Deakin's Punjabis, while the tanks found an unguarded loop road that enabled them <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> the destroyed tanks. The Punjabis had held Shimada until around 6 am in heavy fighting. Deakin and a handful of his remaining Punjabis managed to escape across the Slim River, but most of his battalion were mopped up by the 42nd Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Croydon is {{a gateway}} to the south from central London, and {{therefore}} {{has a number of}} major roads running through it. Purley Way on the A23 road was built <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> Croydon town centre on which the A23 once did, is one of the busiest roads in the borough, and has been the site of several major retail developments including one of only 18 IKEA stores in the country, built {{on the site of the}} former power station. It carries on to Brighton Road which is the main route running towards the south from Croydon to Purley and continues on the A23. The centre of Croydon is very congested, and the urban planning has since become out of date and quite inadequate, due to the expansion of Croydon's main shopping area and office blocks. Wellesley Road, is a dual carriageway that cuts through the centre of the town, and makes it hard to interchange between the civic centre's two railway stations. Croydon Vision 2020 includes a plan for a more pedestrian-friendly replacement. It has also been named as one of the worst roads for cyclists in the area. Construction of the Croydon Underpass beneath the junction of George Street and Wellesley Road/Park Lane during the early Sixties started, with the main aim to prevent traffic congestion on Park Lane, situated above the underpass. The Croydon Flyover on the other hand is situated near the underpass and next to Taberner House. It mainly leads traffic on to Duppas Hill, towards Purley Way with the intention for easy links with Sutton and Kingston upon Thames further afield. The major junction on the flyover is for Old Town, which is also a large three-lane road.|$|E

By varying the thermomechanical ageing treatments applied to the AA 2198 alloy (pre-deformation, heat treatment temperature and duration), T- 1 microstructural parameters (thickness, diameter and volume fraction) are varied over a wide range, and the corresponding yield strength is determined. The resulting database of microstructure strength relationships is used to establish a strengthening model based on interfacial and stacking fault strengthening.

500|$|The city is {{surrounded}} {{on all sides}} by an outer ring road, {{at a distance of}} some [...] from the centre of the city, which allows through traffic <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> the city. The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic. As a consequence many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as car free during business hours or restrict traffic entirely. To alleviate this situation, five bus based park and ride sites operate in York. The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area, with easy access from the ring road, and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus.|$|E

40|$|Haemophilia A (HA) {{is caused}} by {{defective}} synthesis of coagulation factor VIII(FVIII), which has serious effects on haemostasis; joints being the most common site of bleeding. The development of FVIII replacements has improved the situation for patients with haemophilia such that chronic arthropathy can be prevented, and life expectancy {{and the quality of}} life have increased. However, approximately 20 - 30 % of patients suffering from severe HA develop neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against FVIII. Alternative treatment, using by-passing agents, is available for patients exhibiting inhibitors, although these can only be used for the short-term treatment of acute haemorrhage and as prophylaxis during surgery. Furthermore, the clinical response <b>to</b> <b>by-passing</b> products is unpredictable. Two of the studies included in this thesis evaluated the response <b>to</b> <b>by-passing</b> therapy in plasma from patients with HA. The variation in thrombin production within families was found to be significantly lower than the variation between families, indicating that a familial predisposition may influence thrombin formation in response <b>to</b> <b>by-passing</b> agents (Paper I). Moreover, FVIII clotting factors were found to potentiate the in vitro effect of by-passing agents on thrombin formation in plasma from patients with HA exhibiting inhibitors, indicating that further assessment of this treatment strategy in a clinical context is warranted (Paper II). Not all anti-FVIII antibodies have neutralizing capacity. In the studies presented in Papers III & V, non-neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies(NNAs) were investigated in two different cohorts, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NNAs were detected in 18. 9 % of siblings with HA, and in 12. 8 % of unrelated HA subjects followed for four years. The antibody response was assayed using three different rFVIII products. The antibody response was found to be heterogeneous, to vary considerably between individuals (Papers III and V), and also over time (Paper V). None of the patients in the cohort with NNAs observed longitudinally developed inhibitors (Paper V). However, in one patient with moderate HA, the detection of Bethesda-negative anti-FVIII antibodies coincided with a change in bleeding phenotype four years prior to FVIII inhibitor development. This finding suggests that immunoassays may be a useful complement in evaluating the immune response to FVIII (Paper IV). The potential clinical impact of NNAs was evaluated in the long term study (Paper V), showing no association between age, F 8 mutation, or the influence of immune system challenges on NNA development. Interestingly, patients with NNAs had significantly fewer bleeding episodes than NNA-negative patients (p= 0. 048), raising questions about the possibility of yet undefined types of anti-FVIII antibodies with protective or potentiating effects on FVIII...|$|R
