5|$|Also, Newton {{describes}} QR as the {{versed sine}} of the arc with P at its centre and length twice QP. Although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> strictly {{the same as}} the QR that he has in the diagram (Fig.1), in the limit, they become equal.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} Crimea {{has sometimes been}} separated as T. v. tauricus, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{considered to be a}} valid form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in Pleistocene deposits from Poland and Sicily.|$|E
25|$|At the time, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> bad prognostication; however, {{political}} and economic factors within the Eastern Bloc in the 1980s ensured <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be.</b>|$|R

60|$|The old transport, the old {{fulfilment}} of the Ego, the Davidian ecstasy, the assuming of {{all power}} and glory unto the self, the becoming infinite through {{the absorption of}} all into the Ego, this gradually became unsatisfactory. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the infinite, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> immortality. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> eternal death, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> damnation.|$|R
5|$|Every graph G is homomorphically {{equivalent}} to a unique core (up to isomorphism), called the core of G. Notably, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> true in general for infinite graphs.|$|E
5|$|Fraud in the naturalization process. Technically, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{a loss of}} {{citizenship}} but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant never was {{a citizen of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} attack at 12:37 to the {{explosion}} at 14:23, Yamato {{was hit by}} at least 11 torpedoes and six bombs. There may have been two more torpedo and bomb hits, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> confirmed.|$|E

5|$|I've {{always said}} {{throughout}} my political career that if you're in public office, {{you should not}} hire your relatives. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> appropriate. And it leads to the perception that government is only for friends and family. And that's neither good nor right.|$|E
5|$|In a liberalised energy market, investors, {{operators}} and consumers should face {{the full cost}} of their decisions. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the case in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.|$|E

5|$|It is {{sometimes}} understood that fatalities increase {{with the increase}} of VMT, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> systematic as fatalities might remain quite stable while the VMT change.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my dress. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the real wedding.'

5|$|Nonmetals do {{not have}} any {{universal}} or near-universal applications. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the case with metals, most of which have structural uses; nor the metalloids, the typical uses of which extend to (for example) oxide glasses, alloying components, and semiconductors.|$|E
5|$|O: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an {{official}} nomination.
