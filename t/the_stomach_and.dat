5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} the gut, and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine, leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium. The triple protein coats make them resistant to the acidic pH of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> the digestive enzymes in the gut.|$|E
5|$|A lone Japanese {{soldier was}} able to fire off three mortar rounds toward the main gate. Although members of F Company quickly located the soldier and killed him, several Rangers, Scouts, and POWs were wounded in the attack. Battalion surgeon Capt. James Fisher was mortally injured in <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> was carried to the nearby village of Balincari. Scout Alfred Alfonso had a {{shrapnel}} wound to his abdomen. Scout Lt. Tom Rounsaville and Ranger Pvt. 1st Class Jack Peters were also wounded by the barrage.|$|E

5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so {{it acts as}} a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E

5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects the functioning of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> esophagus, {{also known as a}} functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} shoulders, and longer on <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E
500|$|When H. pylori colonizes {{other areas}} of <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>the</b> {{inflammatory}} response can result in atrophy of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> lining <b>and</b> eventually ulcers in <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> [...] This also may increase <b>the</b> risk of <b>stomach</b> cancer.|$|R

[18 F]CFT uptake in <b>the</b> pancreas, <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> kidneys was moderate in the present study. After GBR 12909 pretreatment, the 18 F-activity uptake decreased significantly in the pancreas, indicating DAT-specific binding. In this study, no NET- or SERT-specific binding of 18 F activity was found in the periphery even though extraneuronal NET expression has been found in the lungs, adrenal medulla, and placenta [32].|$|R
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate. Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E
5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Back at Stonehenge, the Doctor {{discovers that}} the {{volunteer}} legionaries, including Rory, are Autons, {{and he is}} quickly captured as his other orbiting foes materialise around him. Above ground, as Rory fights to retain his human identity, Amy suddenly remembers him, but as his Auton identity emerges he unwillingly shoots her in <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> she dies. The Doctor struggles against his captors, who reveal that they have formed an alliance to imprison him in the Pandorica. Knowing the TARDIS exploding would cause the cracks destroying reality, they believe only the Doctor can operate the TARDIS, and thus removing him will prevent the explosion and save the universe. As the Doctor is sealed into the Pandorica, explosions surround the Earth in space before everything fades to black and silence.|$|E
25|$|Bilious {{vomiting}} {{syndrome is}} vomiting {{in response to}} bile-induced inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> Bile salts interfere with the gastric mucosal barrier, allowing acid to irritate <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> lining <b>and</b> cause gastritis.|$|R

5|$|Barton's {{career and}} life have {{been marked by}} {{numerous}} controversial incidents and disciplinary problems {{and he has been}} convicted twice on charges of violence. On 20 May 2008, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 77 days of this prison term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008, he was also given a four-month suspended sentence after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training-ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton has been charged with violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> for attacking three players {{on the final day of}} the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (bloat) is {{a common}} condition in dogs in which <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> fills with gas, and can become torsed. This requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent necrosis of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> wall <b>and</b> death of the dog. During surgery, <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> is deflated <b>and</b> put back into its normal position. A gastropexy may be performed, whereby <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> {{is attached to the}} body wall to prevent this condition from recurring. A splenectomy or partial gastrectomy may also be required.|$|R
