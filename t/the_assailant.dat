5|$|Meanwhile, Wombosi {{continues}} to obsess over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted {{a body in}} the Paris morgue to appear as <b>the</b> <b>assailant,</b> but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this and other CIA secrets to the media. The Professor assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> had been shot twice in the back during the escape; he realizes that he was <b>the</b> <b>assailant.</b> He and Marie take refuge at the French countryside home of her old friend Eamon (Tim Dutton) and his children. Under pressure from Abbott to tie off the Wombosi matter entirely, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends the Professor there, but Bourne shoots him twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him. The Professor reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and Eamon's children away for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone to arrange a meeting. From a rooftop near the arranged location in Paris, Bourne sees Conklin has brought backup, so he abandons the meeting, but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading Bourne to Treadstone's safe house.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> and the victim, between <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
6000|$|She {{kept her}} head and {{referred}} again to her paper. [...] "The missiles of <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> are to be very soft snowballs, hardly more than mere clots, so that nobody can be hurt in the assault, but the defenders may repel <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> with harder snowballs." ...|$|R
60|$|The doors soon {{gave way}} to the attacks upon them, and <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> rushed in, in a crowd. As they did so, the {{defenders}} poured in a terrible fire from their magazine rifles. The heads of the columns melted away, and <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> fell back, hastily.|$|R
60|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> fell dead, {{and with}} a loud shout a number of men rushed out from the wood and fell upon them in rear. <b>The</b> <b>assailants</b> turned to fly, and it was now {{the turn of the}} {{defenders}} of the coach to attack, which they did furiously.|$|R
5|$|While {{serving as}} dean in 1850, Holmes became a witness {{for both the}} defense and {{prosecution}} during the notorious Parkman-Webster murder case. Both George Parkman (the victim), a local physician and wealthy benefactor, and John Webster (<b>the</b> <b>assailant)</b> were graduates of Harvard, and Webster was professor of chemistry at the Medical School {{during the time of}} the highly publicized murder. He was convicted and hanged. Holmes dedicated his November 1850 introductory lecture at the Medical School to Parkman's memory.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode Mulder and Scully are called in to investigate a claim of rape made by a nurse at a nursing home; the case falls into {{the purview of the}} X-Files because <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> {{appears to have been a}} disembodied spirit.|$|E
5|$|At 10:23, {{the judge}} raised a {{security}} alarm. Judicial officers, {{and a federal}} police officer {{who was in the}} court building testifying in an unrelated case, arrived at the scene; however, during the ongoing commotion the police officer mistook Okaz for the attacker and shot him in the upper leg. Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was <b>the</b> <b>assailant.</b> While under arrest, Wiens resisted and begged the police officer to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E
25|$|A {{police officer}} {{shot and killed}} four of <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> and a fifth died of his {{injuries}} hours later. One of <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> was filmed by bystanders being shot by police, including as he rushed towards the police officers. The men were linked to the Barcelona attack according to the police.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Bernstein, {{along with}} his wife, were robbed at gunpoint in their Toronto {{residence}} and bound and forced {{into the trunk of}} Bernstein's Mercedes. <b>The</b> <b>assailants</b> emptied Bernstein's safe of valuables and fled. Both Bernstein and his wife were unharmed in the robbery and <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> were never captured.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>assailants</b> {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> {{courthouse}} around {{nine in the}} morning, carrying rifles and wearing suicide vests. The attackers first began throwing grenades at police officers {{who were at the}} scene. They then started shooting at people. When the police officers tried to attack back at <b>the</b> <b>assailants,</b> they blew themselves up.|$|R
5|$|In 2002 McCaw {{played for}} the All Blacks against the touring Ireland team (15–6 and 40–8 victories) and in the TriNations against Australia and South Africa. Of the six 2002 test matches McCaw played in, five were won by New Zealand with the only loss to Australia. The 14–16 loss {{occurred}} in New Zealand's third TriNations match and ensured the Bledisloe Cup stayed with Australia. During the All Blacks match against South Africa in Durban a pitch invader attacked Irish referee David McHugh as a scrum was being set, dislocating his shoulder in the process. McCaw and A.J. Venter wrestled <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> off the referee and, according to McHugh, {{if they had not}} got involved his shoulder would have been broken. McCaw was rested, along with 20 other members of the TriNations squad, from the 2002 end-of-year tour to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nasuada {{chooses to}} move the Varden from Tronjheim to Surda to mount {{an attack on the}} Empire. The Varden, who are {{effectively}} refugees, suffer financial troubles, until Nasuada learns that she can create an expensive lace with magic, and sell it at extremely low rates. One night when Nasuada is in her room, a character named Elva saves her from an assassination attempt. Elva is enchanted, and locates <b>the</b> <b>assailant,</b> who is killed after unwillingly surrendering information to Varden magicians about a subversive group based in Surda called the Black Hand, who is plotting to kill Nasuada. Nasuada later attends a meeting with key figures in Surda's government to discuss a potential upcoming battle against the Empire. They learn that the conflict is coming sooner than they initially suspected, and mobilize forces to attack, as well as sending for help from the dwarves.|$|E
5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E

5|$|Upon his arrival, Bond is {{contacted}} by Aki, {{assistant to the}} head of the Japanese secret service, Tiger Tanaka, while watching sumo. Aki introduces Bond to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills <b>the</b> <b>assailant,</b> taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise and escapes in the getaway car, which goes to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of president Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to Tanaka's office. The stolen documents are examined and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship Ning-Po with a microdot message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of <b>the</b> <b>assailant,</b> and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime {{did not appear to be}} a retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> two <b>assailants</b> met {{in their}} room, {{prepared}} their weapons, and headed towards Ze'evi's {{room at the}} 8th floor. <b>The</b> <b>assailants</b> waited for Ze'evi near the fire escape, in a location adjacent to Ze'evi's room.|$|R

5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|When police {{confronted the}} {{attacker}} on Brahenkatu street near Puutori, he ignored verbal orders and was immobilised {{with a single}} shot to the leg at 16:05. <b>The</b> <b>assailant</b> was given first aid and taken into custody.|$|E
25|$|The accuser {{also changed}} her {{description}} of Evans. She previously claimed {{that she was}} attacked by a man that looked like Evans except with a mustache, but later stated that <b>the</b> <b>assailant</b> just had a five o'clock shadow.|$|E
50|$|The Cheshire police {{response}} to the bank's report began with assessing the situation and setting up a vehicle perimeter, without revealing their presence.

The police made no effort to make <b>the</b> <b>assailants</b> aware of their presence.|$|R
