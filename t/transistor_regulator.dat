40|$|In {{the process}} of {{designing}} an electric power supply system for an aircraft, parameters like low weight and low losses are important. Reliability, robustness and low cost are other important factors. In the Saab Gripen aircraft, {{the design of the}} primary power supply of the electric flight control system was updated by exchanging a switching <b>transistor</b> <b>regulator</b> to a magnetic amplifier (magamp). By introducing a magamp design, weight was saved and a more reliable power supply system at a lower cost was achieved. In this particular case, with the power supply of the electric flight control system in the Saab Gripen fighter, advantage could be taken of a specific permanent magnet generator (PM-generator). The frequency of the generator offered the perfect conditions for a magamp controller. A key parameter in designing magnetic amplifiers (magamps) is low losses. New amorphous alloys offer new possibilities of the technique in designing magnetic amplifiers, because of their extremely low losses. The core losses are evaluated by studying the equations and diagrams specifying the power losses. The core losses are evaluated and compared with the copper losses in {{the process of}} optimizing low weight and low losses. For this an engineering tool is developed and demonstrated. Evaluations of the hysteresis characteristics for the magnetic alloys, as well as modeling and simulation of the core losses, are presented in this work. The modeling of the core losses includes hysteresis losses, eddy current losses and excess losses as well as copper losses. The losses are studied dynamically during realistic operational conditions. The model can be used for any generic analysis of hysteresis in magnetic circuits. Applications of magnetic amplifiers in aircrafts have been demonstrated to be a feasible alternativeQC 2010110...|$|E

However the tolerance of short-term overcurrent is near zero for semiconductor devices, as their thermal capacities are extremely small.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{gives the}} design and {{implementation}} of a 50 KVA single phase static inverter that uses insulated uses Insulated Gate Bi-polar Transistors (IGBT's) to produce an alternating current square wave at a frequency determined by a crystal controlled oscillator. The output is filtered by a ferroresonant regulator, which creates a low distortion sine wave output from the square wave input and regulates with a minimum amount of components. In addition, it has a built-in current limiting feature for inverter protection. A DC to AC voltage converter consists of four bidirectional switches {{that is used to}} convert the voltage. Single phase static inverters are true on-line ferroresonant transformer-based designs intended for use in UPS systems or in stand-alone applications The control circuit has a small size for the single phase bridge inverter and it is low cost. The driver circuit isolates the control circuit from power circuit. The output for variable AC voltages are discussed.
