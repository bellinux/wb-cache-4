50|$|Trona (<b>trisodium</b> <b>hydrogendicarbonate</b> dihydrate, also {{sodium sesquicarbonate}} dihydrate, Na2CO3•NaHCO3•2H2O) is a non-marine {{evaporite}} mineral. It is mined {{as the primary}} source of sodium carbonate in the United States, where it has replaced the Solvay process used in {{most of the rest of}} the world for sodium carbonate production.|$|E
50|$|Sodium sesquicarbonate (Systematic name <b>trisodium</b> <b>hydrogendicarbonate)</b> Na3H(CO3)2 is {{a double}} salt of sodium {{bicarbonate}} and sodium carbonate, and has a needle-like crystal structure. However, the term is also applied to an equimolar mixture of those two salts, with whatever water of hydration the sodium carbonate includes, supplied as a powder.|$|E

Large natural deposits found in 1938, {{such as the one}} near Green River, Wyoming, have made mining more economical than industrial production in North America.There are important reserves of trona in Turkey; two million tons of soda ash have been extracted from the reserves near Ankara.It is also mined from some alkaline lakes such as Lake Magadi in Kenya by dredging. Hot saline springs continuously replenish salt in the lake so that, provided the rate of dredging is no greater than the replenishment rate, the source is fully sustainable.|$|E
40|$|The {{solution}} mining of salt mineral resources may contaminate groundwater {{and lead to}} water inrush {{out of the ground}} due to brine leakage. Through the example of a serious groundwater inrush hazard in a large salt-mining area in Tongbai County, China, this study mainly aims to analyse the source and channel of the inrushing water. The mining area has three different types of ore beds including trona (<b>trisodium</b> <b>hydrogendicarbonate</b> dihydrate, also sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate, with the formula Na 2 CO 3  [*]×[*] NaHCO 3  [*]×[*]  2 H 2 O, it is a non-marine evaporite mineral), glauber (sodium sulfate, it is the inorganic compound with the formula Na 2 SO 4  as well as several related hydrates) and gypsum (a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with chemical formula CaSO 4  [*]×[*]  2 H 2 O). Based on characterisation of the geological and hydrogeological conditions, the hydrochemical data of the groundwater at different points and depths were used to analyse the pollution source and the pollutant component from single or mixed brine by using physical–chemical reaction principle analysis and hydrogeochemical simulation method. Finally, a possible brine leakage connecting the channel to the ground was discussed from both the geological and artificial perspectives. The results reveal that the brine from the trona mine is the major pollution source; there is a NW–SE fissure zone controlled by the geological structure that provides the main channels through which brine can flow into the aquifer around the water inrush regions, with a large number of waste gypsum exploration boreholes channelling the polluted groundwater inrush out of the ground. This research can be a valuable reference for avoiding and assessing groundwater inrush hazards in similar rock-salt-mining areas, which is advantageous for both groundwater quality protection and public health...|$|E
