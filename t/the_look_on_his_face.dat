500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed". She described the episode's production, [...] "The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Favorite", Ben {{is shown}} to be the {{laughing}} stock of the group as Sam and Sock are always wanting to tease him; [...] Sam's zombie like father hides {{in the backseat of}} Sam's car while Sock and Sam tempt Ben into the car to see <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> when he is scared by Sam's father.|$|E
2500|$|Saint Sebastian is {{a long-standing}} gay icon. The {{combination}} of his strong, shirtless physique, {{the symbolism of}} the arrows penetrating his body, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> of rapturous pain have intrigued artists (gay or otherwise) for centuries, and began the first explicitly gay cult in the 19th century. Richard A. Kaye wrote, [...] "contemporary gay men have seen in Sebastian at once a stunning advertisement for homosexual desire (indeed, a homoerotic ideal), and a prototypical portrait of tortured closet case." ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{got them}} puzzled, {{he saw that}} by <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> captor's face.|$|R
60|$|Carl {{fled to the}} graveyard, {{feeling that}} <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father's face was worse than any whipping.|$|R
60|$|Dale rose {{slowly from}} <b>his</b> seat, <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> frank face {{changing}} from welcome to intense amazement and then wild elation.|$|R
2500|$|Empire.com ranked him #46 {{in their}} list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, praising <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> when he {{strangles}} a cop with his own handcuffs and that [...] "when American novelist Cormac McCarthy wants to throw a dark character at you, it's a safe assumption that you're {{not going to be}} able to get them out of your head for a good, long while - if ever. One of his best is Chigurh, and between the Coens and Bardem, they never missed a beat in bringing this monster to the screen. With the kind of unholy relentlessness usually reserved for horror icons, the hired killer has an almost supernatural ability to track his prey, and is rather short in the mercy department, preferring to leave the tough decisions to a coin toss. And that bowl cut is utterly terrifying." ...|$|E
2500|$|The prince rents {{a room in}} the Ivolgin apartment, {{occupied}} by Ganya; Ganya's sister Varvara Ardalyonovna (Varya); his mother, Nina Alexandrovna; his teenage brother, Nikolai (Kolya); his father, General Ivolgin; and another lodger named Ferdyshchenko. There is much angst within Ganya's family about the proposed marriage, which is regarded, particularly by his mother and sister, as shameful. Just as a quarrel on the subject is reaching a peak of tension, Nastassya Filippovna herself arrives to pay a visit to her potential new family. Shocked and embarrassed, Ganya succeeds in introducing her, but when she bursts into a prolonged fit of laughter at <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> his expression transforms into one of murderous hatred. The Prince, fearing something might happen, intervenes to calm him down, and Ganya's rage is diverted toward him in a violent gesture. Ganya recovers himself, but his extreme discomfort is not helped by the entrance of his father—a drunkard with a tendency to tell elaborate lies. Nastassya Filippovna flirtatiously encourages the General and then mocks him. Ganya's humiliation is compounded by the arrival of Rogozhin, accompanied by a rowdy crowd of drunks and rogues, Lebedyev among them. Rogozhin openly starts bidding for Nastassya Filippovna, ending with an offer of a hundred thousand rubles. With the scene assuming increasingly scandalous proportions, Varya angrily demands that someone remove the [...] "shameless woman". Ganya loses all control and violently seizes his sister's arm. Cheered on by Nastassya Filippovna, Varya spits in his face. He is about to strike her when the Prince again intervenes, and Ganya slaps him in the face with all his might. Everyone is deeply shocked, including Nastassya Filippovna, and she struggles to maintain her mocking aloofness as the others seek to comfort the Prince. Myshkin admonishes her and tells her it is not who she really is. She apologizes to Ganya's mother and leaves, telling Ganya to be sure to come to her birthday party that evening. Rogozhin and his retinue go off to raise the 100,000 rubles.|$|E

60|$|Ralph saw at once by <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> friend's face, and the solicitude {{with which}} he {{examined}} his horses, that Bob had told the first portion of the story, which {{had been more than}} displeasing to him.|$|R
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was {{too much}} for Gratian's composure, and she turned away.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{shook his}} head, {{and there was}} no mistaking <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> as he did so.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> again gave young Jolyon {{the shock}} {{he had felt}} on first seeing his father.|$|E

The whole Court applauded wildly, like soldiers at a theatre, and the Judge began {{to say what}} he thought.|$|R

The western idea of shooting had not yet entered his mind, but woe to Louis Vorlange if his villainy was once unmasked.|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned over}} towards her, but the {{sentence}} was never finished. Reist stood before them, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was a forecast of coming trouble.|$|E

60|$|It {{was evident}} from the millionaire's {{demeanour}} {{that he had seen}} nothing. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was anxious, but not wrathful. He sighted Clarence, and hurried up to him.|$|E

60|$|The gluttonous Teddy stuffed {{his fists}} {{into his eyes}} and lifted up his voice. Keith, who {{understood}} better than <b>the</b> others <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mother's face, took his blubbering young brother by the collar and marched him into the porch. The twins, seeing the summary proceeding, swallowed the outcries they had intended to make, although they couldn't keep a few big tears from running down their fat cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd smash {{hell out}} o' {{you for a}} leather cent," [...] he said. In the tumult his words were lost, but <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was enough. The exhorter fell away.|$|E

60|$|It {{was easy}} to see, by <b>the</b> glowering <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, that <b>the</b> meeting this night had not turned out as he had wished.|$|R
6000|$|... "Phew!" [...] It {{was a low}} and {{significant}} whistle that Allen Winthrop emitted, and <b>the</b> pleasant <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> fine features gave way to one of deep concern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain, can't I go with ye?" [...] It was Luke Striker {{who asked}} the question. <b>The</b> anxious <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face spoke more eloquently than words, and Ben consented without argument.|$|R
60|$|Behind Eric Neil Gordon was {{standing}} tense, crouched, murderous. Even at that distance Kilmeny saw <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> {{saw what he}} held in his hand, and realized in one agonized flash of comprehension what it meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Make another {{move and}} I'll knock you {{senseless}} with this!" [...] he exclaimed and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> showed he meant what he said. Seeing his captors were too powerful for him, Dick subsided {{and was forced}} into a chair in a corner.|$|E
