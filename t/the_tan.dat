40|$|M. Sc. Waste {{generation}} and waste disposal forms {{part of our}} everyday lives, even more so for a tanning facility. This mini dissertation discusses the delisting of waste generated at a tanning facility. This facility produces crust leather from partially tanned hides received from other tanneries in the Mpumalanga province. Crust leather is the product in the penultimate process before it attains its desired leather like properties. The crust leather is sent to a finishing plant for the final process of painting before it is supplied to the automotive industry for upholstery purposes. Large volumes of raw materials including chemicals, water and hides {{are used in the}} retanning process to produce crust leather. During the production of this leather various waste streams are generated including effluent, solid waste and <b>tanning</b> sludge. <b>The</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge is classified in terms of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry’s Minimum Requirements for Handling, Classification and Disposal of Hazardous waste as a possible or potentially hazardous waste. Hazardous waste must be disposed of to a permitted hazardous waste landfill site which has a significant cost implication for <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> facility. This mini-dissertation focuses on the attempt to delist <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge. This mini-dissertation highlights the problems associated with hazardous waste disposal in the form of sludge from the tannery. This disposal is expensive because there is only one permitted hazardous waste landfill site in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces. This site is called Holfontein and is situated approximately 200 km from <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> facility. <b>The</b> high disposal cost encountered is owing to the specialist management required because of the environmental risks involved in operating this waste disposal site. However, an option to delist <b>the</b> hazardous <b>tanning</b> sludge waste is available to <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> facility, which could mean that the hazard rating is reduced from extremely hazardous to a lower rating or even to general waste. Delisting <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge will allow it to be disposed of to a general landfill site. Previous attempts to delist <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge were not successful as the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) and cyanide (CN) in <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge caused it to remain classified as extremely hazardous waste. Due to the increasing waste disposal cost <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> facility once again engaged in the processes to delist <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge. <b>The</b> personnel of <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> facility is of the opinion that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) should not be present in <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge as these substances are not used generally in <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> industry. Therefore, <b>the</b> main aim of this mini-dissertation is to delist <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge to general waste thus allowing it to be disposed of to a general landfill site, which in turn will result in a reduction in the waste disposal costs. Delisting of hazardous waste produced in a tannery In order to achieve the main aim, the study entailed a literature review of the retanning process explaining the generation of the various waste streams, the possible presence of chromium (Cr) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) in the process, and a review of the environmental legislation that will determine the waste disposal options. To delist <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> facility followed a defined procedure as determined by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. <b>The</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge was assessed using analytical procedures as specified. The objective was to characterise the leachability of <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge, as well as to verify the presence of any hazardous substances which prevent <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge from being delisted. Leachability is the potential mobilisation of substances from the sludge under circumstances similar than that of the waste disposal sites. This includes the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge. In an approach to verify the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge <b>the</b> composition of the raw materials (chemicals and hides) were evaluated and samples were taken from the various effluent streams. <b>The</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge was sampled separately to determine the leachability characteristics. No hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) were found to be present in the raw materials or in any of the waste effluent streams. However, small quantities of cyanide (CN) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) were found to be present in <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge. <b>The</b> reason for the presence of these constituents could not be determined as it was proved that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) do not enter the process through the raw materials. It was further proved that the process does not support circumstances to oxidise trivalent chromium to hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). Further, the presence of cyanide (CN) cannot be explained since it is not a substance that is generally used in <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> industry. Part of the study included determining treatment options for <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge. It was found that treating <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge with lime reduced the concentration of heavy metals such as hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). However, after analysis and classification of <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge it was found that it was not the hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) that prevented <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge from being delisted to a lower hazard rating but rather the presence of small quantities of cadmium (Cd). Cadmium (Cd) is classified as extremely hazardous and therefore it is this substance that is responsible for the high hazard rating classification of the sludge. Although the objective to delist <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> sludge was not achieved, it was determined that the waste can be disposed of to a general waste landfill site permitted to accept a certain amount of waste containing heavy metals (such as chromium and manganese). The reduction in the waste disposal cost will therefore be achieved and <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> facility will dispose of their waste in a Delisting of hazardous waste produced in a tannery sound and environmentally responsible method ensuring it will not {{have a significant impact on}} the environment...|$|R

5|$|Between 1926 and 1933 {{numerous}} other local productions were released. Although Dutchmen like Heuveldorp and G.

During the mid-1930s, production dropped {{as a result of}} the Great Depression. The release of Albert Balink's commercially and critically successful Terang Boelan (Full Moon) in 1937 led to renewed interest in filmmaking, and 1941 saw thirty locally produced films. This rate of production declined after the Japanese occupation beginning in early 1942, closing all but one film studio; this resulted in several films which had begun production in 1941 being released several years later. The majority of films produced during the occupation were short propaganda pieces. Following the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945 and during the ensuing revolution several films were made, by both pro-Dutch and pro-Indonesian backers; the Dutch formally recognised Indonesia's sovereignty on 27 December 1949, leaving the Dutch East Indies defunct.|$|E

50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. <b>The</b> most common <b>tanning</b> material is chromium, which leaves <b>the</b> <b>tanned</b> leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The hides, when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2.

Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> material to <b>the</b> leather—and <b>the</b> more <b>tanning</b> material fixed, <b>the</b> higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance.

40|$|Abstract Background The pigment melanin is {{produced}} by specialized cells, called melanocytes. In healthy skin, melanocytes are sparsely spread among the other cell types in the basal layer of <b>the</b> epidermis. Sun <b>tanning</b> results from an UV-induced increase in the release of melanin to neighbouring keratinocytes, the major cell type component of the epidermis as well as redistribution of melanin among these cells. Here we provide a mathematical conceptualization of our current knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> response, {{in terms of a}} dynamic model. The resolution level of the model is tuned to available data, and its primary focus is to describe <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> response following UV exposure. Results The model appears capable of accounting for available experimental data on <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> response in different skin and photo types. It predicts that the thickness of the epidermal layer and how far the melanocyte dendrites grow out in the epidermal layers after UV exposure influence <b>the</b> <b>tanning</b> response substantially.
