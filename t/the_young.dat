40|$|This study {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} the suitability of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation family members in small and medium-sized family businesses to successfully manage the business after management succession. Data from 270 questionnaires linked to 77 family businesses were collected and analysed. An Oblimin oblique rotation was performed on the principal components of the exploratory factor analysis. Five factors with eigen-values greater than one, explaining 65, 78 % of the variance, were extracted. These five factors describing the theoretical dimensions of the dependent variable, the suitability of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation to manage the family business after succession, and the independent variables, namely value adding by <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation, willingness of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation, credibility of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation and <b>the</b> degree of self-empowerment by <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation family members. The findings of this study indicated that the three independent variables, value-adding of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation, <b>the</b> willingness of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation to be in the family business and the credibility of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation have a significant positive influence on the perceived suitability of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation. Practical recommendations are suggested to ensure a smooth final transfer of the management and control of the business to <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation family members...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort <b>the</b> <b>young</b> by softly vocalizing, with <b>the</b> <b>young</b> twittering in response.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; <b>the</b> <b>young</b> are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E
