5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France. By that time, the BEF {{consisted}} of 10 infantry divisions in three corps, a tank brigade and a Royal Air Force detachment of around 500 aircraft. The BEF was pinned by a German diversionary attack through Belgium and then isolated {{by the main}} attack <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> the Ardennes forest. Well-equipped and highly mobile Panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht overran the French and then British prepared defences. There was some fierce fighting, however being dwarfed by the German land forces most of the BEF withdrew to a small area around the French port of Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited {{and led him}} {{to think he was}} a god. Philo of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.|$|E
5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> the Exchequer, not all {{sources of income}} went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E

50|$|Lahiri often {{spoke of}} the Guru-disciple {{relationship}} {{in the context of}} Kriya Yoga. He always gave the Kriya technique as an initiation, and taught that the technique was only properly learned as part of the Guru-disciple relationship. Frequently he referred to the realization <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> practicing Kriya as taught by the Guru, and the grace <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> the 'transmission' of the Guru. He also taught that the grace of the Guru comes automatically if his instructions are followed. He suggested contacting the Guru during meditation, counseling that it wasn't always necessary to see his physical form.|$|R

25|$|The Pernambucan {{revolt of}} 1817 {{occurred}} {{in the province of}} Pernambuco in the Northeastern region of Brazil, and was sparked mainly by the decline of sugar cane production and the influence of the Freemasonry in the region. Other important reasons for the revolt include: the ongoing struggle for the independence of Spanish colonies in South America; the independence of the United States; the generally liberal ideas <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> all of Brazil the century before, including many French Enlightenment Philosophers, such as Charles Montesquieu and Jean-Jacques Rousseau; the actions of secret societies, which insisted on the liberation of the colony; the development of a distinct culture in Pernambuco.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1840s, railway mania swept {{throughout}} the United Kingdom. At a meeting arranged by {{the supporters of}} an Inverness to Elgin railway on 19 February 1845, it was generally agreed that such a railway would be beneficial. Grant addressed the meeting stating {{that he had no}} objection but warned the people of Elgin that Lossiemouth harbour was important to Elgin and that they should be wary of companies who could interfere with the free trade <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> the port. These warnings were heeded and Grant succeeded in resurrecting the scheme as the Morayshire Railway at a meeting held on 3 March 1845. At a further meeting held on 11 April, it was also decided that the track would extend south to Craigellachie.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of complete separation and equality was followed in all future grants of independence to countries which became realms, including those <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> {{the winds of}} change that swept through Africa in the 1960s, {{the collapse of the}} Federation of the West Indies in 1962, and at later dates. The most recently created Commonwealth realm is Saint Kitts and Nevis, which achieved the status in 1983. The process of separation was completed when the residual rights of the British parliament in the affairs of Canada, Australia and New Zealand reserved by the Statute of Westminster were repealed in the 1980s, through the Constitution Act 1982 for Canada, the Australia Act 1986 and the Constitution Act 1986 for New Zealand, and corresponding legislation in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while {{the participant was}} led to believe they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> the headphones {{they were more likely to}} say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E

The bridges were constructed of Galena faced limestone quarried just upstream the Rock River from Dixon at Dement's Quarry. The first train passed over the trio of bridges along West First, Second and Third Streets on February 1, 1855. The arrival of the train prompted the local media to quip of the train, [...] "like a huge chariot of fire on a monstrous beast, it bellowed along -- high above the dwellings."

2500|$|In 2011 the DOJ {{charged that}} CVS {{pharmacies}} in Sanford, Fla., ordered enough painkillers to supply a population eight times its size.

According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, in 2010 a single CVS pharmacy in Sanford ordered 1.8 million Oxycodone pills, an average of 137,994 pills a month. Other pharmacy customers in Florida averaged 5,364 oxycodone pills a month. DEA investigators serving a warrant to a CVS pharmacy in Sanford on October 18, 2011, noted that [...] "approximately every third car <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> the drive-thru lane had prescriptions for oxycodone or hydrocodone."

2500|$|Although the Phillies led the National League standings {{for most}} of the 1950 season, a late-season tailspin (triggered by the loss of {{starting}} pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On {{the last day of the}} season, the Phillies hung onto a one-game lead when Dick Sisler's dramatic tenth-inning, three-run home run against the Dodgers clinched the Phils' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and recipients of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games. [...] Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the city's favorite team. [...] In 1954, the Athletics moved to Kansas City, and sold Shibe Park (renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953) to the Phillies. [...] Carpenter didn't want to buy it, believing it would cost the Phillies more in the long run to own the park than it would renting it from the Athletics.

2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions.

Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it.

50|$|Unlike {{stationary}} normal shockwaves, moving normal shockwaves {{are more}} commonly available in physical situations. For example, a blunt object entering {{into the atmosphere}} faces a shock <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> the medium of a non-moving gas. The fundamental problem <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>through</b> moving normal shockwaves is the moment of a normal shockwave through motionless gas.
