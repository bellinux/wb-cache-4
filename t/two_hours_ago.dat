500|$|Alavés manager José Manuel Esnal praised {{his players}} despite their loss: [...] "Dortmund {{has seen a}} great final, and it was {{possibly}} the smallest team in the competition that made it great." [...] Esnal saluted his players for their character especially for equalising twice in the match: [...] "We played with pride and class to get the score back to 4–4 {{at the end of}} normal time, the result of that, however, was that we were half dead going into extra-time. But we're the same team as we were <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> One side always has to lose a final, just as one wins." ...|$|E
500|$|The game on May 1 in Philadelphia {{became a}} moment of peace in the rivalry during {{the top of the}} ninth inning. Mets' Daniel Murphy was batting as a pinch-hitter against Phillies' {{reliever}} Ryan Madson when the fans started chanting [...] "U-S-A!" [...] The Phillies didn't know the reason for the chants, but in the Mets' dugout, bench coach Ken Oberkfell told Manager Terry Collins that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, had been killed by United States special operations forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Shane Victorino later told the Phillies the news. However, when asked how they learned about it during an on-air telephone call with Mike and Mike in the Morning on ESPN Radio the next day, he said that a trainer in the dugout broke the news. Ryan Howard called the news [...] "an uplifting moment," [...] while Victorino said it was [...] "a special moment...for families...who...lost their loved ones...(on) 9/11" [...] and [...] "a big day in American history." [...] On the Mets' side, David Wright called it [...] "just an incredible moment and...you kind of come together...for a common cause", while Collins said that the Mets 21, 14-inning win behind Ronny Paulino's game-winning RBI double in his Mets debut was [...] "a good win for us, and obviously a huge win for America tonight", but felt they [...] "could have finished the game <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> and celebrated a little bit of it." [...] Mike Lopresti of USA Today called the game between the rivals [...] "a perfect fit" [...] when the news broke, while Adam Rubin of ESPNNewYork.com called the peace in the rivalry [...] "fitting" [...] for a Mets fan, and said that it drew parallels to their 32 win over rival Atlanta Braves on September 21, 2001 in the first major sporting event in New York City since the attacks.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} corporal, [...] "you may be {{surprised}} to hear that he was seen heading for this bluff <b>two</b> or three <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> and that we struck his trail where he crossed the creek not a mile back." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I only arrived <b>two</b> {{or three}} <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> My name is Hilliard.

I only received my commission {{a few days before}} leaving Cairo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That, {{and being}} so very shy of men, too, {{must have made}} John's {{handsome}} regimentals quite overpowering to her, poor thing,' added Mrs. Garland, following the catastrophic young lady upstairs, whose indisposition was this time beyond question. And yet, by some perversity of the heart, she was as eager now {{to make light of}} her faintness as she had been to make much of it <b>two</b> or three <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R

As he's the only Kroo among them, I took the helm myself after that. I don't fancy he has broken anything." ...|$|R

Hostage Selina Win Pe told him they had made the request <b>two</b> or three <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> and Monis {{wanted to know why}} it hadn’t happened.Ms Wen Pe made a second call saying that if the lights were not turned off within 15 minutes Monis threatened to shoot her. Yet half an hour later there was still no confirmation whether the lights could go off.|$|R
5000|$|Why do I say all this? Not, assuredly, to boast; not, assuredly, to {{give the}} {{slightest}} countenance to complacency. The dangers we face are still enormous, but so are our advantages and resources. I recount them because the {{people have a right}} to know that there are solid grounds for the confidence which we feel, and that we have good reason to believe ourselves capable, as I said in a very dark <b>hour</b> <b>two</b> months <b>ago,</b> of continuing the war [...] "if necessary alone, if necessary for years.|$|R
