60|$|With those words, <b>Trottle</b> made a low bow, {{and quietly}} left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{can he be}} {{anything}} else?" [...] I said, answering for <b>Trottle,</b> who sat obstinately silent. [...] "This time, Jarber, you have not only read us a delightfully amusing story, but you have also answered {{the question about the}} House. Of course it stands empty now. Who would think of taking it after it had been turned into a caravan?" [...] I looked at <b>Trottle,</b> as I said those last words, and Jarber waved his hand indulgently in the same direction.|$|E
6000|$|... "I only {{wished to}} ask, sir," [...] said <b>Trottle</b> doggedly, [...] "if you could kindly oblige {{me with a}} date or two in {{connection}} with that last story?" ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{no denying}} that Jarber, when we were left together, looked sadly discomposed. He had evidently {{forgotten}} to inquire about dates; and, {{in spite of his}} magnificent talk about his series of discoveries, it was quite as plain that the two stories he had just read, had really and truly exhausted his present stock. I thought myself bound, in common gratitude, to help him out of his embarrassment by a timely suggestion. So I proposed that he should come to tea again, on the next Monday evening, the thirteenth, and should make such inquiries in the meantime, as might enable him to dispose triumphantly of <b>Trottle's</b> objection.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't triumph," [...] said Jarber, folding up {{the second}} manuscript, and looking hard at <b>Trottle.</b> [...] "I don't triumph over this worthy creature. I merely {{ask him if}} he is {{satisfied}} now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad to know, with great respect," [...] persisted <b>Trottle,</b> [...] "if the person named Magsman was the last tenant {{who lived in the}} House. It's my opinion--if I may be excused for giving it--that he most decidedly was not." ...|$|E
60|$|He gallantly {{kissed my}} hand, made a neat little speech of acknowledgment, {{and took his}} leave. For {{the rest of the}} week I would not {{encourage}} <b>Trottle</b> by allowing him to refer to the House at all. I suspected he was making his own inquiries about dates, but I put no questions to him.|$|E
60|$|Before he began, I {{rang the}} bell for Trottle; being {{determined}} to have him present at the new reading, as a wholesome check on his obstinacy. To my surprise Peggy answered the bell, and told me, that <b>Trottle</b> had stepped out without saying where. I instantly felt the strongest possible conviction {{that he was at}} his old tricks: and that his stepping out in the evening, without leave, meant--Philandering.|$|E
50|$|When the gump opens, {{the rescuers}} are {{directed}} to the <b>Trottle</b> house by the ghosts that live in Platform 13. There they see Raymond <b>Trottle,</b> who has grown up to be fat, lazy, and very spoiled. He seems to rely on his telly, his computer games and his remote control cars. They also meet the household servant, a boy named Ben. Ben is {{the exact opposite of}} Raymond and immediately feels comfortable with the group and befriends Odge.|$|E
50|$|Heartbroken, {{the group}} {{returns to the}} island except for Odge, as she would prefer to stay with Ben. Shortly before the gump will close, Nanny dies and leaves a note for Ben. It reveals that Ben was really the kidnapped prince, however Mrs. <b>Trottle</b> had {{discovered}} shortly after abducting {{him that she was}} pregnant. Odge rescues Ben from some cruel men Mrs. <b>Trottle</b> hired to take Ben to a nasty boarding school. They leave for the gump and return to the Island just in time. Raymond is sent back through the gump to Platform 13, Ben is reunited with his parents and Odge is invited to live in the castle with him.|$|E
5000|$|The plot {{concerns}} {{an elderly}} woman, Sophonisba, who notices {{signs of life}} in a supposedly empty dilapidated house (the eponymous [...] "House to Let") opposite her own and employs the efforts of an elderly admirer, Jabez Jarber, and her servant, <b>Trottle,</b> to discover what is happening within.|$|E
5000|$|Platform 13 of King's Cross Station in London {{has been}} closed for years. Changes to the {{platform}} always result in failure for mysterious reasons. The {{reason is that the}} platform hides a gump, described as an [...] "opening that opens once every nine years for nine days". The gump leads to the Island, a wonderful mythical paradise filled with both normal and magical creatures such as giants, mermaids, water nymphs, wizards, witches, hags and merrows, people who married mermaids/mermen. Shortly before the gump opens, the Queen gives birth to a baby boy. The three nurses for the baby Prince are overcome with their homesickness for the land where they grew up and wish to visit London when the gump reopens. They are given permission to do so and bring the Prince with them. On the ninth day, however, the three nurses go to a fish and chip shop but decide not to take the baby inside. Instead, one of the nurses sits outside with the baby while her two sisters buy fish and chips for three. In the garage nearby a woman called Mrs. <b>Trottle,</b> who is desperate for a child, is sitting in her car. Lily the nurse falls asleep on the bench and Mrs. <b>Trottle</b> steals the baby prince and drives away with the baby, having placed a china doll in the place of the prince. Nanny Brown, who was Mrs. Trottle's nurse as a child, is horrified by the kidnapping. Mrs. <b>Trottle</b> threatens to call the police if Nanny dares to tell anyone and decides to name the baby [...] "Raymond". She goes away to Switzerland for a year and pretends she has had the baby there. She is a preposterously rich woman who does not work as her husband works for such a large salary that his income is five hundred thousand pounds a year, as Mrs. <b>Trottle</b> claims. Back in the tunnel, the three nurses only discover that the prince is gone when it is too late and the gump has closed again for nine years. The King and Queen are heartbroken and for the next eight and a half years the Island is in deepest mourning.|$|E
50|$|Raymond mysteriously vanishes {{the next}} day however, and the group discovers that he told Mrs. <b>Trottle</b> of the plan. Believing that strangers {{intended}} to kidnap her child, she took him into hiding at a fancy hotel with several bodyguards. The group hatch a plan to take Raymond back, but everything falls apart when Ben is knocked out and nearly killed {{by one of the}} bodyguards. Given the choice of taking Raymond or rescuing Ben, the group chooses to save Ben. Raymond is abducted later by a swarm of harpies that the king and queen send and is successfully brought to the Island.|$|E
