50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stepping</b> method are <b>the</b> hook <b>step</b> and <b>the</b> swing <b>step.</b> Their qualities are: <b>the</b> hook <b>step</b> must be small, and <b>the</b> swing <b>step</b> must be big.|$|R
40|$|Simulations of {{turbulent}} convection flow {{adjacent to}} a two-dimensional backward-facing step are presented to explore <b>the</b> effects of <b>step</b> height on turbulent separated flow and heat transfer. Reynolds number and duct’s height downstream from <b>the</b> <b>step</b> are kept constant at Re 0 = 28, 000 and H = 0. 19 m, respectively. Uniform and constant heat flux of qw = 270 W/m 2 is specified at <b>the</b> <b>stepped</b> wall downstream from <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> while other walls are treated as adiabatic. The selection of the values for these parameters is motivated {{by the fact that}} measurements are available for this geometry and they can be used to validate the flow and heat transfer simulation code. Two-equation low-Reynolds-number model is employed to achieve the turbulent Prandtl number. The primary and secondary recirculation regions increase in size as <b>the</b> <b>step</b> height increases. <b>The</b> bulk temperature increases more rapidly as <b>the</b> <b>step</b> height increases. Increasing <b>the</b> <b>step</b> height causes <b>the</b> magnitude of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy to increase. Near <b>the</b> <b>step</b> and below <b>the</b> <b>step</b> height, <b>the</b> turbulent kinetic energy becomes smaller as <b>the</b> <b>step</b> height increases. Inside the recirculation region, magnitude of the peak friction coefficient does not significantly change with <b>the</b> increase of <b>step</b> height. <b>The</b> friction coefficient becomes smaller in magnitude with the increase of <b>the</b> <b>step</b> height. <b>The</b> peak Stanton number becomes smaller as <b>the</b> <b>step</b> height increases...|$|R
30|$|In the experiment, {{the height}} of <b>the</b> <b>step</b> was assumed as 100  mm, {{just as in the}} simulation. As {{previously}} described, in <b>the</b> <b>step</b> climbing process of the front casters, the wheelchair performs a static wheelie motion so that the front casters hover above the ground. In <b>the</b> <b>step</b> climbing process of the large wheels, the large wheels hover above the ground until they are at the same height as <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> and in <b>the</b> <b>step</b> climbing process of the drive wheel, the drive wheel climbs along the side of <b>the</b> <b>step</b> by cooperative control of the linear actuator and the drive wheel. The experiment investigated whether the wheelchair could perform these step climbing processes using the constructed mechanism.|$|R

40|$|The {{drift of}} adatoms {{strongly}} influences the wandering pattern of an isolated step {{moving in a}} surface diffusion field. When the drift velocity has a component against <b>the</b> <b>step</b> motion and exceeds a critical value, <b>the</b> straight <b>step</b> becomes unstable with long wavelength fluctuations, and wanders. This wandering pattern can be controlled by changing {{the direction of the}} drift. When the drift has no component parallel to <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edge, <b>the</b> unstable <b>step</b> obeys <b>the</b> Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and shows a chaotic pattern. When the drift has a component parallel to <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edge, <b>the</b> <b>step</b> obeys <b>the</b> Benney equation.

40|$|On a Si(111) vicinal face {{near the}} {{structural}} transition temperature, the 1 × 1 {{structure and the}} 7 × 7 structure coexist in a terrace: the 1 × 1 structure is in the lower side of <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edge and <b>the</b> 7 × 7 structure in the upper side. The diffusion coefficient of adatoms is different in the two structures. Taking account of {{the gap in the}} diffusion coefficient at <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> we study <b>the</b> possibility of <b>step</b> wandering induced by drift of adatoms. A linear stability analysis shows that <b>the</b> <b>step</b> wandering always occurs with step-down drift if the diffusion coefficient has a gap at <b>the</b> <b>step.</b> Formation of straight grooves by <b>the</b> <b>step</b> wandering is expected from a nonlinear analysis. The stability analysis also shows that step bunching occurs irrespective of the drift direction if the diffusion in the lower side of <b>the</b> <b>step</b> is faster. <b>The</b> <b>step</b> bunching disturbs <b>the</b> formation of grooves. If step-step repulsion is strong, however, <b>the</b> <b>step</b> bunching is suppressed and the straight grooves appear. Monte Carlo simulation confirms these predictions.

30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{condition}} {{required for the}} drive wheel to climb <b>the</b> <b>step</b> was analyzed.
