40|$|Background: Care {{transitions}} are {{a common}} and frequently adverse aspect of health care, resulting in a high-risk period for both care quality and patient safety (Coleman, 2003; Forster et al., 2003; Picker Institute 1999; van Walraven et al., 2004; Cook et al., 2000). Patients who have complex care needs and undergo treatment from multiple care settings may be at a greater risk for poor care transitions (Coleman et al., 2004). Using quantitative performance measurement scales is one method that can assess {{the quality of care}} transitions, and identify areas for improvement. The psychometric properties of the primary performance measurement scale, the Care Transitions Measure (CTM), have not been rigorously assessed, particularly within a higher risk, medically complex population such as older adults with musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders. Furthermore, despite the negative health implications that can result from poor transitions and the commonality of care transitions among persons with complex care needs, there is a significant dearth of research on this crucial aspect of health care. Methods: This research examines the ability of the CTM to adequately assess the quality of care transitions among a complex population of older MSK rehabilitation patients and explores care transitions {{from the perspective of the}} patient and the health care provider. Information was gathered through telephone administration of the CTM to MSK patients after they transitioned from inpatient rehabilitation units to home, and through a series of qualitative key informant interviews with a range of health care professionals in care settings relevant to the care continuum of older MSK patients. Inter-rater reliability, a type of reliability that has never been tested with the CTM, and construct validity were assessed and qualitative analyses were used to examine qualitative information obtained through the CTM administration to patients and through the interviews with health care providers. Results: The CTM demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability for the overall score (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 77; p= 0. 03) despite only fair agreement between each item. Internal consistency of the CTM was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 94). The construct validity of the CTM was supported; however qualitative data from the patient and health care provider perspectives suggest additional items should be considered for inclusion. Qualitative information from patients also suggests the need for revisions to the wording of some items and the response options. Health care provider interviews suggest that issues surrounding transitional care are similar regardless of the care setting involved. Conclusions: Although the CTM proved to be reliable, qualitative data suggests that the addition of items should be considered to improve the content validity of the CTM, which would in turn improve its construct validity as well. Recommendations for scale improvement are made, as are recommendations for an alternative scale to assess care transition quality from a health care provider perspective. The results of this study support efforts to improve the outcomes of care <b>transitions,</b> <b>care</b> planning, and the overall quality of life for older rehabilitation patients...|$|E

The DEMMI and Modified Barthel Index were administered within 5 working days of admission and discharge from the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Program. Outcome measuresThe DEMMI and Modified Barthel Index. ResultsNeither the DEMMI nor the Modified Barthel Index had a floor or ceiling effect. Similar evidence of convergent, discriminant and known-groups validity were obtained for each instrument. The DEMMI was significantly more responsive to change than the Modified Barthel Index using criterion- and distribution-based methods. The minimum clinically important difference estimates represented similar proportions of the scale width for the DEMMI and Modified Barthel Index and were similar using criterion- and distribution-based estimates. Rasch analysis identified the DEMMI as essentially unidimensional in a <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Program cohort and therefore can be applied to obtain interval level measurement.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the distribution of hospital and aged care services for older people, with a particular focus on <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> places, across Australia and to determine the relationships between the provision of these services. METHODS: Aggregation of health and aged care service indicators by Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) region including: public and private acute and subacute (rehabilitation and geriatric evaluation and management) hospital beds, flexible and mainstream aged care places as at 30 June 2006. RESULTS: There was marked variation in the distribution of acute and subacute hospital beds among the 79 ACAT regions. Aged care places were more evenly distributed. However, the distribution of <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> places was uneven. Rural areas had poorer provision of all beds. There was no evidence of coordination in the allocation of hospital and aged care services between the Commonwealth and state/territory governments. There was a weak relationship between the allocation of <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> places and the distribution of health and aged care services. DISCUSSION: Overall, the distribution of services available to older persons is uneven across Australia. While the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Program is flexible and is providing rural communities with access to rehabilitation, it will not be adequate to address the increasing needs associated with the ageing of the Australian population. An integrated national plan for aged care and rehabilitation services should be considered. Lynne C Giles, Julie A Halbert, Len C Gray, Ian D Cameron and Maria Crott...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore, via {{empirical}} comparison, the relationship between quality of life, as measured by the ICECAP-O capability index (a new instrument designed to measure and value quality of life in older people), with both self-reported health status and the quality of <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> in adults aged 65 and over participating in two post acute rehabilitation programs (outpatient day rehabilitation and the Australian National <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> residential program). Methods The ICECAP-O was administered to patients receiving either outpatient day rehabilitation (n[*]=[*] 53) or residential <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> (n[*]=[*] 29) during a face to face interview. The relationships between the ICECAP-O and other instruments, including the EQ- 5 D (a self-reported measure of health status) and CTM- 3 (a self-reported measure of the quality of <b>care</b> <b>transitions),</b> the type of post-acute care being received and socio-demographic characteristics were examined. Results The mean ICECAP-O score for the total sample was 0. 81 (SD: 0. 15). Patients receiving outpatient day rehabilitation generally reported higher levels of capability, than patients receiving residential <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> (mean 0. 82 [SD: 0. 15] and 0. 79 [SD: 0. 164] respectively), however these differences were not statistically significant. The mean EQ- 5 D score for the total sample was somewhat lower than the ICECAP-O (mean 0. 55; SD: 0. 27) indicating significant levels of health impairment with the outpatient day rehabilitation group demonstrating slightly higher levels of health status than the <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> group (mean 0. 54 [SD: 0. 254] and mean 0. 49 [SD: 0. 30]). The ICECAP-O was found to be positively correlated with both the CTM- 3 (Spearman’s r = 0. 234; p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) and the EQ- 5 D (Spearman’s r[*]=[*] 0. 437; p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). The relationships between the total EQ- 5 D and CTM- 3 scores and the individual attributes of the ICECAP-O indicate health status and quality of <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> in this patient population to be influential in some, but not all aspects of capability. Conclusions The correlations between the ICECAP-O, EQ- 5 D and CTM- 3 instruments illustrate that capability is strongly and positively associated with health-related quality of life and the quality of <b>care</b> <b>transitions.</b> However further research is required to further examine the construct validity of the ICECAP-O and to examine its potential for incorporation into economic evaluation. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for acute care services {{due in part to}} rising proportions of older people and increasing rates of chronic diseases. To reduce pressure and costs in the hospital system, community-based post-acute care discharge services for older people have evolved as one method of reducing length of stay in hospital and preventing readmissions. However, it is unclear whether they reduce overall episode cost or expenditure in the health system at a more general level. In this paper, we review the current evidence on the likely costs and benefits of these services and consider whether they are potentially cost-effective from a health services perspective, using the Australian <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Programme as a case study. Evaluations of community-based post-acute services have demonstrated that they reduce length of stay, prevent some re-hospitalisations and defer nursing home placement. There is also evidence that they convey some additional health benefits to older people. An economic model was developed to identify the maximum potential benefits and the likely cost savings from reduced use of health services from earlier discharge from hospital, accelerated recovery, reduced likelihood of readmission to hospital and delayed entry into permanent institutional care for participants of the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Programme. Assuming the best case scenario, the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Programme is still unlikely to be cost saving to a healthcare system. Hence for this service to be justified, additional health benefits such as quality of life improvements need to be taken into account. If it can be demonstrated that this service also conveys additional quality of life improvements, community-based programmes such as <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> could be considered to be cost-effective when compared with other healthcare programmes.

Background: Poorly executed <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> {{can result in}} additional health care spending due to adverse outcomes and delays as patients wait to transfer from acute care to facilities providing different levels of care. Patients and their families play an integral role in ensuring they receive safe care, as they are the one constant in <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> processes. However, patients&rsquo; and family members&rsquo; perspectives on how safety threats are detected and managed across <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> from health <b>care</b> facility to health care facility remain poorly understood. Methods: This qualitative study used semistructured interviews with patients (15) and family members (seven) who were transferred from an acute care hospital to a complex continuing care/rehabilitation care facility. Data were analyzed using a directed content analytical approach. Results: Our results revealed three key overarching themes in the perceptions: lacking information, getting &ldquo;funneled through&rdquo; too soon, and difficulty adjusting to the shift from total care to almost self-care.

This project was undertaken to gain insight into the practice setting realities for nurses and other health care providers as they manage increasingly complex <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> across multiple settings. Methods. The Appreciative Inquiry approach was used to guide interviews with sixty-six healthcare providers from a variety of practice settings. Data was collected on participants’ experience of exceptional <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> and opportunities for improving <b>care</b> <b>transitions.</b> Results. Nurses and other healthcare providers need to know three things to ensure safe care transitions: (1) know your client; (2) know your team on both sides of the transfer; and (3) know the resources your client needs and how to get them. Three themes describe successful <b>care</b> <b>transitions,</b> including flexible structures; independence and teamwork; and client and provider focus. Conclusion. Nurses often operate at the margins of acceptable performance, and flexibility with regulation and standards is often required in complex sociotechnical work like <b>care</b> <b>transitions.</b> Priority needs to be given to creating conditions where nurses and other healthcare providers are free to creatively engage and respond in ways that will optimize safe <b>care</b> <b>transitions...</b>|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} prevalence of diabetes mellitus in children, transitioning patients from childhood to adulthood are increasing. High-risk behaviors and poor glycemic control {{during the transition}} period increase the risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia as well as chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications. Discussions regarding complications and preparations for transition must take place before the actual <b>transition</b> to adult <b>care</b> systems. Pediatric care providers should focus on diabetes self-management skills and prepare at least 1 year prior to the transfer. Pediatric providers should also provide a written summary about previous and current glycemic control, complications {{and the presence of}} mental health problems such as disordered eating behaviors and affective disorders. <b>Transition</b> <b>care</b> should be individualized, with an emphasis on diabetes self-management to prevent acute and long-term complications. Regular screening and management of complications should proceed according to pediatric and adult guidelines. Birth control, use of alcohol, smoking and driving should also be discussed. Barriers to self-management and care must be recognized and solutions sought. The goals of transitional care are to effectively transition the diabetic patient from the pediatric to adult care system with less elapsed time in between and to improve post-transition outcome. Previous studies regarding diabetes transitional care programs including patient education programs, medical coordinators and auxiliary service systems reported promising results.

40|$|Background: Programmes {{specific}} to {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) that facilitate transition from paediatric to adult care are currently lacking. Aim: We aimed to explore the perceived needs of adolescents with IBD among paediatric and adult gastroenterologists and to identify barriers to effective transition. Methods: A web-based survey of paediatric and adult gastroenterologists in Australia and New Zealand employed both ranked items (Likert scale; from 1 not important to 5 very important) and forced choice items regarding the importance of various factors in faciitating effective transition of adolescents from paediatric to adult care. Results: Response rate among 178 clinicians was 41 %. Only 23 % of respondents felt that adolescents with IBD were adequately prepared for <b>transition</b> to adult <b>care.</b> Psychological maturity (Mean = 4. 3, standard deviation (SD) = 0. 70) and readiness as assessed by adult caregiver (Mean = 4, SD = 0. 72) were prioritised {{as the most important}} factors in determining timing of transfer. Self-efficacy and readiness as assessed by adult caregiver were considered the two most important factors to determine timing of transition by both groups of gastroenterologists. Poor medical and surgical handover (Mean = 4. 10, SD = 0. 8) and patients' lack of responsibility for their own care (Mean = 4. 10, SD = 0. 82) were perceived as major barriers to successful transition by both paediatric and adult gastroenterologists. Conclusions: Deficiencies exist in current <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> of adolescents with IBD in Australia and New Zealand. Standardising <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> practices with strategies aimed at optimising communication, patient education, self-efficacy and adherence may improve outcomes...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} an integrative review protocol to analyse and synthesize peer-reviewed research evidence {{in relation to}} engagement of {{patients and their families}} in communication during <b>transitions</b> of <b>care</b> to, in and from acute care settings. BACKGROUND: Communication at <b>transitions</b> of <b>care</b> in acute care settings can be complex and challenging, with important information about patients not always clearly transferred between responsible healthcare providers. Involving patients and their families in communication during <b>transitions</b> of <b>care</b> may improve the transfer of clinical information and patient outcomes and prevent adverse events during hospitalization and following discharge. Recently, optimizing patient and family participation during <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> has been acknowledged as central to the implementation of patient-centred care. DESIGN: Integrative review with potential for meta-analysis and application of framework synthesis. REVIEW METHOD: The review will evaluate and synthesize qualitative and quantitative research evidence identified through a systematic search. Primary studies will be selected according to inclusion criteria. Data collection, quality appraisal and analysis of the evidence will be conducted by at least two authors. Nine electronic databases (including CINAHL and Medline) will be searched. The search will be restricted to 10  years up to December 2013. Data analysis will include content and thematic analysis. DISCUSSION: The review will seek to identify all types of patient engagement activities employed during <b>transitions</b> of <b>care</b> communication. The review will identify enablers for and barriers to engagement for patients, families and health professionals. Key strategies and tools for improving patient engagement, clinical communication and promoting patient-centred care will be recommended based on findings...|$|R
40|$|Current post-acute <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> are {{frequently}} fragmented, disorganized {{and can be}} confusing for patients and families. Through a coordinated and systematic approach to <b>care</b> <b>transitions,</b> readmissions to acute care may be reduced. Patients with stroke provide an excellent model for <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> due to the complicated nature of the diagnoses, the prevalence of complications that occur and the potential to enter the healthcare system at any point along the continuum. Yet little evidence exists with respect to preventing stroke rehabilitation patients from being re-hospitalized to acute care. The purpose of this capstone project was to implement and evaluate a checklist targeted to improve the <b>transition</b> of <b>care</b> in stroke patients discharged home from inpatient rehabilitation. The findings of the project suggest the checklist was effective in reducing readmissions for the stroke rehabilitation population discharged home. Further evaluation and validation is indicated by using the checklist with other rehabilitation diagnoses as well as within other rehabilitation units and facilities...|$|R
40|$|Medication {{errors are}} common within the United States health system. Preventable {{medication}} errors {{are often the}} result of ineffective processes {{that contribute to the}} occurrence of adverse drug events. <b>Care</b> <b>transitions,</b> movement between settings or levels of care, present a particularly vulnerable time for patients. Errors are frequently introduced into a patient's medication regimen during <b>transitions</b> of <b>care,</b> including the inappropriate discontinuation or duplication of medications. Inappropriate discontinuation (non-persistence) of evidence based therapies for chronic diseases places patients at an increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Previous investigations have indicated that <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> due to hospitalization have been associated with increased rates of non-persistence, and that non-persistent patients were at an increased risk for poor health outcomes...|$|R
