In a Summer that included strong competition, including Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service, which was ironically directed {{by one of the}} animators who left the production of this film, it grossed ¥0.9 billion ($10 million USD) in its release and was considered a box-office flop, against a budget of around ¥3 billion ($35 million USD).|$|R

5|$|During {{the night}} of 18/19 October, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> the route that the Australians were using to supply the 2/17th {{defending}} Jivevaneng and established a road block astride the Jivevaneng–Sattelberg road. The 2/17th {{and a number of}} other Australian units, such as most of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, as well as part of the 2/28th, became isolated behind Japanese lines. In order to keep them supplied, emergency air drops of ammunition were flown in by pilots of No. 4 Squadron RAAF.|$|R
50|$|Thatcher was off {{the landing}} beaches on 18 March and fired her only {{bombardment}} of the day against two groups of <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> off by guerrillas in villages near the assault area. The 40th Infantry Division landed at 09:00 and met very little opposition. As Army troops landed at Negros Occidental on the 29th, the destroyer assisted with call fire and continued the task until 5 April when she was relieved. She refitted at San Pedro to prepare for action in the Ryūkyūs.|$|R
5000|$|The Camphor {{measures}} 25 metres {{tall and}} 3 metres in diameter. It gets its name {{because it had}} five branches like five fingers, although only four of them remain today. It was said that during Japanese Occupation, when Lai Chi Wo was occupied as a military backup base for the Japanese Army, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> down many trees for fear that their enemies will hide near the area and make sudden attacks. When the soldiers threatened to chop this five-finger Camphor, the villagers stood up to protected the tree with their lives. Therefore, {{only one of the}} [...] "fingers" [...] has been cut.|$|R
50|$|Another {{theory is}} that Amelia Earhart was {{captured}} by Japanese forces. This theory came about {{as a result of}} the similarities of Earhart's Lockheed Electra's components to the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. In 1966, CBS Correspondent Fred Goerner published a book claiming that Earhart and Noonan were captured and executed when their aircraft crashed on the island of Saipan, part of the Mariana Islands archipelago, while it was under Japanese occupation. In 2009, an Earhart relative stated that the pair died in Japanese custody, citing unnamed witnesses including Japanese troops and Saipan natives. He said that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> the valuable Lockheed aircraft into scrap and threw the pieces into the ocean.|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a {{contrastive}} {{analysis of}} function verbs in English and <b>Japanese,</b> <b>cut</b> and kiru {{in the framework}} of the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995). Despite their division sense, these two express performance of an event when they take constituents which denote eventuality. They differ, however, in the resulting event structures. On the one hand, ‘cut+an event nominal’ can be dealt with as involving a generative operation called co-composition, and describes a temporally bounded event. On the other hand, V-kiru denotes an accomplishment event by means of another operation, type coercion. ?This analysis also accounts for the difference in selection restriction between the two forms. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fortress}} {{at the end}} of {{the southern}} landing beaches (a.k.a. “The Point”) continued to cause heavy casualties due to enfilading fire from heavy machine guns and anti-tank artillery across the landing beaches. Puller ordered Captain George P. Hunt, commander of K Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, to capture the position. He approached The Point short on supplies, having lost most of his machine guns while approaching the beaches. Hunt's second platoon was pinned down for nearly a day in an anti-tank trench between fortifications. The rest of his company was endangered when the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> a hole in their line, surrounding his company and leaving his right flank cut off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video on}} the English and Japanese sides differ, though, with the Japanese side {{sporting}} {{what appears to}} be a new, higher quality transfer from the original Japanese master. Like the original Japanese release and the UK release, the movie is presented in 1.85:1 non-anamorphic widescreen. The addition of Chun-Li's shower scene and a longer credit roll also makes the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> of the film longer by three minutes. The dubbed US and UK versions are still slightly cut. The English dubbed version has two words containing [...] "fuck" [...] from it, one with the scene with Dee Jay and the scene with Bison, Guile, E. Honda, Ryu, and Ken.|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} a methodology {{to quantify the}} combined effects of two major nontariff barriers (NTBs), sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and customs and administrative procedures. We employ a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function with factor-augmenting technical progress to incorporate changes {{in the quality of}} goods. We then estimate the effects of these two NTBs in the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> flower market. Results show that estimates of SPS are biased without considering product quality changes caused by the customs and administrative procedures for highly perishable agricultural products. If these Japanese NTBs were removed, findings suggest there would be a significant increase in cut flower imports by Japan. customs and administrative procedures, cut flowers, Japan, non-tariff barriers, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, trade, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

The next day, he ordered the 161st Indian Brigade to move forward to Kohima again, but only one battalion, 4th Battalion Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Laverty, and a company of the 4th Battalion, 7th Rajput Regiment arrived in Kohima before the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> the road west of the ridge. Besides these troops from 161st Brigade, the garrison consisted of a raw battalion (the Shere Regiment) from the Royal Nepalese Army, some companies from the Burma Regiment, some of the Assam Regiment which had retired to Kohima and various detachments of convalescents and line-of-communication troops. The garrison numbered about 2,500, of which about 1,000 were non-combatants and was commanded by Colonel Hugh Richards, who had served formerly with the Chindits.|$|R

5000|$|In the Dallas Observer, Luke Y. Thompson wrote:"A lot {{of people}} are likely to be {{surprised}} by what they see. The 1954 <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> is shot like a classic film noir, and the buildup to Tokyo's inevitable thrashing is quite slow by today's standards. The echoes of World War II are very strong, and the devastation wrought by Godzilla (played by Haruo Nakajima) is not sugar-coated; it eerily mirrors that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the deaths and injuries are dwelt upon. The monster himself is not fully revealed for quite a while, and even when he finally shows up, he's a malevolent black predator with glistening skin, who stays mostly in the shadows, many times more fearsome than the green-skinned cookie monster who showed up in the various sequels to layeth the smacketh down on the candyasses of numerous alien invaders in ugly leotards." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{three main}} cuts of karate gi are Kata, European and <b>Japanese.</b> The <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> has short sleeves and {{trousers}} for less restriction. This cut {{also has a}} longer lapel that prevents it from riding up over the belt (obi). The Kata cut is very rare. It has even shorter sleeves and is chosen more for aesthetic appeal. European Cut has longer sleeves and trouser. The lapel is shorter. This cut again is chosen for aesthetic appeal. Karate uniforms come in {{a wide array of}} colours. Most Karateka still wear white. Some clubs use a system of differing colours to differentiate students from instructors. [...] Different styles of Karate have slightly different uniforms though all share the same basic design, differing only in the lengths of sleeves, legs and the skirt of the uwagi (jacket). Many karateka tend to wear their obi (belt) much longer than judoka and other martial artists.|$|R
2500|$|Many written {{reports and}} testimonies {{collected}} by the Australian War Crimes Section of the Tokyo tribunal, and investigated by prosecutor William Webb (the future Judge-in-Chief), indicate that Japanese personnel {{in many parts of}} Asia and the Pacific committed acts of cannibalism against Allied prisoners of war. In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: [...] "cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers". This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an Indian POW, Havildar Changdi Ram, testified that: [...] " [...] the Kempeitai beheaded [...] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters...

5000|$|In addition, Afternoon of Darkness {{includes}} a complete dual language option and {{the option to}} turn off battle animations. Most of the silent <b>Japanese</b> <b>cut</b> scenes now include voice acting. However, when set to English, the scenes that were originally silent in the PS2 release are still silent. To reflect Etna's recent voice actor change, her lines have been re-recorded to match Michelle Ruff's portrayal of Etna in Disgaea 2 and the anime. One notable omission is the theme song [...] "The Invasion from Within" [...] by Tsunami Bomb. As Atlus was {{the publisher of the}} original PS2 version and arranged for the licensing of the song, and NIS America (Nippon Ichi's American branch) published the PSP port themselves, they did not retain the rights to use the song and did not renegotiate for them. Also missing is the song [...] "One With the Stars" [...] which, like [...] "The Invasion from Within", was added in the original PS2 release by Atlus.|$|R
