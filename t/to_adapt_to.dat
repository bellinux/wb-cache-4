5|$|Arafat's ability <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> new {{tactical}} {{and political}} situations was perhaps {{tested by the}} rise of the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel.

5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} {{has the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> environmental pressures and limits natural selection thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E

In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up and down the country to manage hotels.|$|E
