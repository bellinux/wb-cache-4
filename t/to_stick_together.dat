5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together.</b> Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together)</b> or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together.</b> The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E

25|$|Alum is used {{to clarify}} water by {{neutralizing}} the electrical double layer surrounding very fine suspended particles, allowing them <b>to</b> flocculate (<b>stick</b> <b>together).</b> After flocculation, the particles will {{be large enough to}} settle and can be removed.|$|R
50|$|Casimir forces {{observed}} experimentally {{in nature}} have almost always been attractive and have rendered nanoscale and microscale machines inoperable by causing their moving parts <b>to</b> permanently <b>stick</b> <b>together.</b> This {{has been a}} long-standing problem that some researchers have tried to solve.|$|R
25|$|The first solid {{particles}} were microscopic in size. These particles orbited the Sun {{in nearly}} circular orbits {{right next to}} each other, as the gas from which they condensed. Gradually the gentle collisions allowed the flakes <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together</b> and make larger particles which, in turn, attracted more solid particles towards them. This process is known as accretion.|$|E
25|$|In high-ester pectins at soluble {{solids content}} above 60% and a pH-value between 2.8 and 3.6, {{hydrogen}} bonds and hydrophobic interactions bind the individual pectin chains together. These bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together.</b> These form a 3-dimensional molecular net {{that creates the}} macromolecular gel. The gelling-mechanism is called a low-water-activity gel or sugar-acid-pectin gel.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{problems}} with producing nanoparticles initially arise once these nanoparticles are generated in solution. Without {{the use of}} a stabilizing agent, nanoparticles tend <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together</b> once the stirring is stopped. In order to counteract this, a certain collidial stabilizer is generally added. These stabilizers bind to the nanoparticles in a way that prevents other particles from bonding with them. Some effective stabilizers found so far include citrate, cellulose, and sodium borohydride.|$|E

25|$|The crash {{resulted}} in a national embarrassment, leading Captain Albert W. Stevens, the scientific observer on board the Explorer balloon, to lobby for another attempt with an improved balloon to be named Explorer II. But news of the fatal crash of a Russian stratospheric attempt in 1934 left President Gilbert H. Grosvenor of the NGS sobered by the risk. A review of the crash by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) was held between July and September, revealing that the balloon had not opened symmetrically during the ascent, which caused stresses {{that led to the}} fabric tears. A month-long delay prior to launch had allowed the rubberized cotton <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together,</b> which created the uneven expansion. The hydrogen explosion followed when the gas in the bag mixed with the oxygen in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|After Phil {{is treated}} at a clinic, Alan confesses {{that he had}} drugged some of the marshmallows from the {{previous}} night with muscle relaxers and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him. Phil breaks it up and tells them that they have <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together.</b> They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password {{by the next morning}} in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey (who had the code given to him and put inside his jacket for safe-keeping by Chow) back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured. After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is.|$|E

50|$|Overlaps between {{sheets of}} fresh {{oilcloth}} would amalgamate naturally when pressed together. This tendency also led <b>to</b> the cloth <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> when folded. Where a folding cover was needed, the cloth was waxed or dusted with pumice to reduce this.|$|R
50|$|Friction whirligigs, {{also called}} Gee-Haws, {{depend on the}} holder rubbing a stick against a notched shaft {{resulting}} in a propeller {{at the end of}} the shaft turning, largely as the result of the vibration carried along the shaft. The motion needed to power a friction whirligig is very similar <b>to</b> rubbing <b>sticks</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> create fire. Friction whirligigs are another staple of craft shops and souvenir stores in the Appalachian Mountains.|$|R

Dom agrees <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together</b> and suggests they steal the money from Reyes {{to start a new}} life. They organize a team to perform the heist: Han, Roman, Tej, Gisele, Leo, and Santos. Vince later joins the team after saving Mia from being captured by Reyes' men.|$|E
500|$|In {{his closing}} argument, Coakley {{described}} a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker {{shortly after the}} explosion when {{two and a half}} companies were mixed together for two weeks. Coakley stated that conspiratorial talk among the men about refusing to work and {{trying to get out of}} loading ammunition was the root of their August 9 mass refusal. Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together.</b> Coakley entered into the record his definition of mutiny: [...] "Collective insubordination, collective disobedience of lawful orders of a superior officer, is mutiny." [...] He gave his opinion that men who admitted in time of war that they were afraid to load ammunition were of a low moral character and were likely to give false testimony.|$|E
500|$|Michigan's defense forced three turnovers, sacked the Illinois quarterback four times, {{and held}} Illinois' offense to 37 rushing yards on 33 {{attempts}} {{for an average}} of 1.1 yards per carry. Mike Martin led the defense with nine tackles. After the game, Michigan's defensive coordinator Greg Mattison became emotional as he told reporters: [...] "That was a Michigan defense. ... Nobody knows what went on inside of these guys and for them <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together</b> and to play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it says a lot about them." [...] Defensive end Ryan Van Bergen, who recorded 2.5 sacks, three tackles for loss and seven tackles overall, was named the Big Ten's Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E

50|$|The {{soil texture}} is {{determined}} by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil. The interaction of the individual mineral particles with organic matter, water, gases via biotic and abiotic processes causes those particles <b>to</b> flocculate (<b>stick</b> <b>together)</b> <b>to</b> form aggregates or peds. Where these aggregates can be identified, a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, porosity, consistency, reaction (acidity), etc.|$|R

2500|$|Bacterial {{conjunctivitis}} {{causes the}} rapid onset of conjunctival redness, {{swelling of the}} eyelid, and mucopurulent discharge. [...] Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days. [...] Bacterial conjunctivitis due to common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish mucopurulent discharge that may cause the lids <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>together,</b> especially after sleep. [...] Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur. [...] The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. [...] The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Common bacteria responsible for non-acute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus sp. Less commonly Chlamydia trachomatis is involved.|$|E
2500|$|Following a bye week, Michigan {{returned}} home to face Purdue in its homecoming game. Michigan handily defeated Purdue, 36–14. Michigan then traveled to Iowa City, Iowa to face Iowa.
