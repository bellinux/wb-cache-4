50|$|Tesco {{provides}} <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> rental {{services on}} a day-rate basis for land and offshore drilling rigs and after-market sales and service for its customers. Tesco’s <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> rental fleet comprised 132 units on December 31, 2011. In order of size by region from highest to lowest, Tesco currently has rental units in Latin America, the United States and Canada, Russia, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East. In {{response to the}} economic downturn and operating conditions during 2009, Tesco redeployed over 10% of Tesco’s U.S. fleet to international locations, including the Middle East, Latin America, Russia and Asia. Tesco's major competitors in the <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> market include National Oilwell Varco, Canrig, a subsidiary of Nabors, and FDS.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> {{allows the}} {{drilling}} rig to drill the longer section of a stand of drill pipe in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill 30 ft (single drill pipe) sections of drill pipe whereas a <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> can drill 60 - 90 ft stands (double and triple drill pipe respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on {{the drilling rig}} size. Handling longer sections of drill pipe enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to 90 ft can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer [...] "connections" [...] to add another 30 ft of drill pipe. Another advantage of <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> systems is time efficiency. When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore {{for the length of}} the kelly in order to add one more length of drill pipe. With a <b>top</b> <b>drive,</b> the draw works only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints. Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while drilling fluid is not being pumped.|$|E

In addition, several other accessories packages are available. Other companies operating in the same sector include National Oilwell Varco, Franks International, Canrig, and Weatherford International.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of <b>top</b> <b>drives</b> exist, and are usually classified based on the [...] "Safe Working Load" [...] (SWL) of the equipment and the size and type of motor used to rotate the drillpipe. For offshore and heavy duty use, a 1000 short ton unit would be used, whereas a smaller land rig may only require a 500 short ton device. Various sizes of hydraulic motors, or AC or DC electric motors, are available.|$|R

50|$|A {{detailed}} stability {{review was}} performed by FaAA {{as part of its}} investigation. It opined that the ship was designed, built, and operated in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Standards. In 1988, the ship was modified to include a <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> unit. The stability effect of this modification was analyzed by FaAA, and it found that stability improved due to conversion of the No. 3 center tank to permanent ballast as part of the <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> modification. (FaAA never found the alleged ABS calculations and certification of the ship's stability with the <b>top</b> <b>drive.)</b> At the time of the capsize, FaAA opined the ship was operating within accepted stability standards. However, its investigation revealed errors in the wind overturning moment calculations performed by the shipbuilder and approved by ABS. Erroneous instructions in the operator's manual would allow the ship to be operated with the height of the vertical center of gravity above accepted limits, resulting in reduced stability margin. FaAA opined that while this could have been a serious issue in this situation, it was not, since the ship was operating at less than the maximum allowable vertical position of the center of gravity prior to the event.|$|E

50|$|The winding, {{hillside}} {{road from}} Tantalus to Round Top in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{dates back to}} 1892. Tantalus Drive and Round <b>Top</b> <b>Drive</b> were gravel roads when they were completed in 1917, but were paved in 1937. In March 2007, a seven-mile stretch of the road {{was added to the}} State Register of Historic Places, and in August 2009 to the National Register of Historic Places, the first such designation for a roadway on Oahu. The more populated lower portions of Tantalus Drive and Round <b>Top</b> <b>Drive</b> were not so designated. This road joins the Hana Highway on Maui on the National Register, and 97 such Historic Roads nationally. Not all of the latter are on the National Register, but some are listed among the Federal Highway Administration's National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> is a {{mechanical}} device on a drilling rig that provides clockwise torque to the drill string to drill a borehole.

5000|$|Instead of {{rotating}} {{the drill}} bit {{by using a}} rotary table or <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> at the surface, it is turned by a downhole MUD MOTOR, powered by the motion of drilling fluid pumped from surface. Drilling which {{is powered by a}} mud motor instead of a rotating pipe is generally called slide drilling.|$|E

50|$|A {{drill string}} on a {{drilling}} rig is a column, or string, of drill pipe that transmits drilling fluid (via the mud pumps) and torque (via the kelly drive or <b>top</b> <b>drive)</b> to the drill bit. The term is loosely {{applied to the}} assembled collection of the drill pipe, drill collars, tools and drill bit. The drill string is hollow so that drilling fluid can be pumped down through it and circulated back up the annulus (the void between the drill string and the casing/open hole).|$|E
