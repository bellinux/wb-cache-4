5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to <b>their</b> <b>taste.</b> Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E
5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} inventiveness {{focused on}} the pillars, door panels, lintels (torana), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as Kirtimukha (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals <b>their</b> <b>taste</b> for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E

5|$|Though {{they are}} edible, the {{appearance}} of these mushrooms is more distinctive than <b>their</b> <b>taste.</b> The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, and has undergone several name changes. It is the type species of the genus Cortinarius, but is readily distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct cystidia. There are some populations that seem to prefer deciduous trees and others that prefer pines, but no genetic divergence between the two has been found. When identified as taxonomically separate from the deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring populations have been referred to either as a separate species, C.hercynicus, or as a subspecies, C.violaceus ssp. hercynicus. Other populations once identified as C.violaceus or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species, such as C.palatinus, C.neotropicus, C.altissimus, C. kioloensis and C.hallowellensis.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, Eglantyne Louisa Jebb, Mary Fraser Tytler {{and others}} {{initiated}} the Home Arts and Industries Association {{to encourage the}} working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, {{but in order to}} provide them with useful occupations and to improve <b>their</b> <b>taste.</b> By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.|$|E
25|$|Of course, edible fungus {{plays a role}} in many {{societies}} {{throughout the}} world, as well. Many epigeous mushrooms are collected and consumed on a regular basis, and more recent commercial harvesting is beginning to play a larger economic role in certain locales. Certainly, truffles (Tuber), porcinis (Boletus) and chanterelles (Cantharellus) are commonly known for <b>their</b> <b>taste</b> and culinary importance, as well as their billion dollar worldwide market.|$|E
30|$|Microeconomic theory {{posits that}} {{consumers}} accurately predict their future utility when solving their intertemporal optimization problems. However, accurately predicting future tastes requires that consumers understand both {{the direction and}} magnitude of how <b>their</b> <b>tastes</b> might change (Loewenstein et al., 2003). Unfortunately, consumers do not always accurately predict these changes in <b>their</b> <b>tastes</b> and preferences. Loewenstein et al. (2003) coined the term “projection bias” to describe the general bias that has been documented {{in relation to the}} prediction of future tastes.|$|R

25|$|Democritus, {{along with}} Leucippus and Epicurus, {{proposed}} the earliest {{views on the}} shapes and connectivity of atoms. They reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded {{to the shape of}} the atoms involved. Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of <b>their</b> <b>taste,</b> are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Frederick and Elizabeth {{settled in}} a {{clapboard}} house located at 524 Marshall Street, Milwaukee. Although Layton’s business was successful and while his contemporaries were moving into larger, more luxurious residences, Layton {{and his wife}} maintained their home {{to the end of}} their days. It was recorded that inside the house were plain, old-fashioned furniture and homemade rag rugs laid on painted wood floors. Frances Stover wrote: “Mr. Layton enjoyed visiting the fine homes of his friends; he praised <b>their</b> <b>taste,</b> he admired architectural niceties. But for himself, the small square house was sufficient.” Frederick and Elizabeth had no children. Elizabeth died on 3 June 1910.|$|E

25|$|Absinthe's {{popularity}} grew steadily {{through the}} 1840s, when absinthe {{was given to}} French troops as a malaria preventive. When the troops returned home, they brought <b>their</b> <b>taste</b> for absinthe home with them. The custom of drinking absinthe gradually became so popular in bars, bistros, cafés, and cabarets that, by the 1860s, the hour of 5p.m. was called l'heure verte ("the green hour"). Absinthe was favoured by all social classes, from the wealthy bourgeoisie, to poor artists and ordinary working-class people. By the 1880s, mass production had caused the price of absinthe to drop sharply. By 1910, the French were drinking 36million litres of absinthe per year, as compared to their annual consumption of almost 5billion litres of wine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the area}} {{surrounding}} Cato's Sabine farm were {{the lands of}} Lucius Valerius Flaccus, a young nobleman of significant influence and high patrician family. Flaccus could not help remarking on Cato's energy, his military talent, his eloquence, his frugal and simple life, and his traditional principles. Flaccus himself {{was a member of}} that purist patrician faction which displayed its adherence to the stricter virtues of the ancient Roman character. Within Roman society a transition was in progress—from Samnite rusticity to Grecian civilization and oriental voluptuousness. The chief magistracies of the state had become almost the patrimony of a few distinguished families whose wealth corresponded to their upper-class birth. Popular by acts of graceful but corrupting generosity, by charming manners, and by the appeal of hereditary honours, they collected the material power granted by a multitude of clients and followers, as well as the intellectual power provided by their monopoly on philosophical education, by <b>their</b> <b>taste</b> in the fine arts, and by their knowledge of stylish literature. Nevertheless, the reaction to them was strong. The less fortunate nobles, jealous of this exclusive oligarchy, and openly watchful of the decadence and disorder associated with luxury, placed themselves {{at the head of a}} party which showed its determination to rely on purer models and to attach much importance to the ancient ways. In their eyes, rusticity, austerity, and asceticism were the marks of Sabine robustness and religion and of the old Roman inflexible integrity and love of order. Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Scipio Africanus and his family, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, may be taken as representative of the new civilization; Cato's friends, Fabius and Flaccus, were the leading men in the faction defending the old plainness.|$|E
25|$|The first Pro Spectacular was {{launched}} in Reno, Nevada on January 4, 1985. While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for <b>their</b> <b>taste)</b> and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough people knew about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US you would be lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, never mind a BMX race. It seems ironic that BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, {{when you look at the}} fact that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit a far cry from the 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first snow fall in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E
