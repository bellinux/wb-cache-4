5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E

5|$|Carnivàle is an American {{television}} series that aired on HBO between 2003 and 2005. Created by Daniel Knauf, the show traces the disparate storylines {{of a young}} carnival worker named Ben Hawkins (played by Nick Stahl) and a preacher in California named Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown) during the United States Dust Bowl. Although Carnivàle was praised for its production and art style, the unfolding story proved too inaccessible for the general audience {{and led to the}} show's cancellation after <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> planned seasons. The inaugural season of Carnivàle garnered numerous awards and nominations, including five Emmy Awards and two Emmy nominations in the creative arts categories. The second season received eight Emmy nominations. Nominations for two Golden Reel Awards, four Satellite Awards and two Saturn Awards did not result in a win. The only actor of Carnivàles large main cast to win an award was Adrienne Barbeau ("Ruthie") with a WIN Award (Women's Image Network Awards). Overall, Carnivàle has received nine awards from twenty-one nominations.|$|E

25|$|While the NCAA {{has never}} officially {{endorsed}} a championship team, it has documented {{the choices of}} some selectors in its official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records publication. In addition, various analysts have independently published their own choices for each season. These opinions can often diverge with others {{as well as individual}} schools' claims to national titles, {{which may or may not}} correlate to the selections published elsewhere. Currently, two widely recognized national champion selectors are the Associated Press, which conducts a poll of sportswriters, and the Coaches' Poll, a survey of active members of the American Football Coaches Association. Since 1992, various consortia of major bowl games have aimed to invite the top two teams at the end of the regular season (as determined by internal rankings, or aggregates of the major polls and other statistics) to compete in a de facto national championship game. The current iteration of this practice, the College Football Playoff, selects four teams to participate in national semi-finals hosted by <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> partner bowl games, with their winners advancing to the College Football Playoff National Championship.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{he became}} {{well known as}} Major Neuheim in the award-winning Private Schulz and as Sir Godber Evans in Channel 4's {{adaptation}} of Porterhouse Blue.

He portrayed Anthony Blunt, the Soviet spy and Surveyor of The King's Pictures in the BBC film Blunt: the Fourth Man (1986) opposite Anthony Hopkins as Guy Burgess. In 1988, he played Edward Spencer, the eccentric and oblivious English landowner in 1920s' Ireland in Troubles, from J. G. Farrell's award-winning novel. In 1987, he played a variation on this role, when he portrayed the Bishop of Motopo in the non-musical television film Monsignor Quixote, based on Graham Greene's modernized take on Don Quixote. He played Sir Nigel Irvine in John Mackenzie's adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's novel The Fourth Protocol (1987).|$|E

25|$|On September 26, 2016, Pierce {{announced}} that the 2016–17 season {{would be his last}} in the NBA. He did not appear for the Clippers in their first 12 games of the season, as they compiled a 10–2 record in that time. On November 18, 2016, he made his season debut, scoring six points in nine minutes off the bench in a 121–115 win over the Sacramento Kings. He also played the following night against the Chicago Bulls before sitting out the next four games. With the Clippers resting Blake Griffin on November 29 against the Brooklyn Nets, Pierce made his first start of the season and logged 29 minutes. He shot just 1-of-7 from the field, however, and finished with five points, three rebounds and one steal in a 127–122 double overtime loss. On December 20, Pierce started in place of the injured Blake Griffin but played just 19 minutes against the Denver Nuggets. It was only his eighth game of the year and second start. He hit <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>six</b> field goals to finish with seven points and one rebound. In what would be his last game in Boston, on February 5, 2017, Pierce started and played the first five minutes before heading to the bench—it was his first appearance for the Clippers since New Year's Eve. Although the crowd chanted his name in the final minutes, Pierce did not re-enter the game until there was 19 seconds left; he hit a three-pointer to finish the game for his only points of the contest. On April 10, 2017, he scored all of his 10 points in the final five minutes of the Clippers' 125–96 win over the Houston Rockets. He subsequently moved into 15th on the NBA career scoring list with 26,397 points. The Clippers finished the regular season with a 51–31 record and entered the playoffs as the No. 4 seed. They went on to lose their first-round playoff series to the Utah Jazz in seven games, as Pierce's 19-year NBA career came to an end at the final buzzer of Game 7 on April 30, 2017. In his final game, he had six points and three rebounds in 21 minutes, and averaged 11.1 minutes in the series. On June 28, 2017, he was waived by the Clippers.|$|E

Speight had previously had a medial collateral ligament injury. Speight hired quarterback guru Steve Clarkson to help him regain his form and posted 2,900 yards and 32 touchdowns in ten games during the 2012 season.

In a post-cancellation interview, Daniel Knauf was positive {{that someone would}} let him finish his story someday, if not as a television series, then possibly {{as a series of}} features or graphic novels. Knauf approached Marvel Comics to continue the future Carnivàle storyline that he had kept to himself. They seemed interested, but HBO, who own the show and the characters, would not confer their rights. During the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, Knauf stated that [...] "an idiosyncratic show like Carnivàle would never be greenlit today," [...] and claimed that present-day television included a high percentage of [...] "talking heads" [...] with [...] "the vast majority of television writers [...] visual storytellers." [...] Enjoying his creative freedom as graphic storyteller, he has considered directing his efforts away from television series creation. Meanwhile, the mythology of Carnivàle remains in the public conscience. In 2008, Alessandra Stanley of the Australian newspaper The Age remembered Carnivàle as a [...] "smart, ambitious series that move unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively," [...] while A.V. Club called the show [...] "a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology".|$|E

As of 2015, Indian Point generates approximately 10% of the state's electricity needs, and 25% of the electricity used in New York City and Westchester County. Its contract with Consolidated Edison is for just 560 megawatts. [...] The New York Power Authority, [...] which built Unit 3, stopped buying electricity from Indian Point in 2012.

Entergy sells the rest of Indian Point's output to utilities in upstate NY and elsewhere in New England. [...] Although many states with similarly sized nuclear industries are net electricity exporters, New York has historically been an electricity importer due to its high consumption. In 2013, New York had the fourth highest average electricity prices in the United States.
