2500|$|At {{any point}} in the fugue there may be [...] "false entries" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> which include <b>the</b> start of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> but are not completed.

5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E

50|$|In Hindi, {{volition}} can {{be expressed}} with certain verbs, when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> did something on purpose <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> noun gets <b>the</b> ergative case suffix.

25|$|The DOF beyond <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> {{is always}} {{greater than the}} DOF in front of <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is at <b>the</b> hyperfocal {{distance}} or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, so the ratio is 1:∞; as <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> distance decreases, near:far DOF ratio increases, approaching unity at high magnification. For large apertures at typical portrait distances, the ratio is still close to 1:1. The oft-cited rule that 1/3 of the DOF {{is in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and 2/3 is beyond (a 1:2 ratio) is true only when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> distance is 1/3 the hyperfocal distance.|$|R
50|$|Sadananda {{explains}} that hearing is determination that the Vedanta teaches non-duality of Brahman {{on the basis}} of six characteristic signs - a) presentation of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter at <b>the</b> beginning and the conclusion, b) repetition or repeated presentation of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter, c) originality i.e. <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter is not known through any other source, d) result or utility of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter, e) eulogy or praise of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter and f) demonstration or reasoning in support of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter.

Fish have {{had a role in}} culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of art, books and movies.|$|E
40|$|Jacques Lacan {{significantly}} influenced Althusser's {{accounts of}} ideology and <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> Althusser's belief {{that science is}} a discourse without a subject parallels Lacan's belief that in the Symbolic Order <b>the</b> <b>Subject</b> and <b>the</b> Other are alienated. Althusser's account of interpellation, which explains how ideology recognizes individuals as subjects, takes for granted Lacan's notion of the mirror stage. Althusser repudiates the plenitude of <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> whose interpellation conceals its lack; Lacan shows that <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> failure to express itself in language makes <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> a void. However, Althusser, whose subject is too much like Lacan's ego, fails {{to distinguish between the}} "I" of <b>the</b> split <b>subject</b> and <b>the</b> "ego" of <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> imaginary self-identity. What is more, Althusser rejects the self-consciousness implied by <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> lack of plenitude and its suturing interpellation...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} <b>subject</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> Kemak language in Belu Regency, East Nusa Tenggara. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> characteristics are identified by testing the arguments predicted as a <b>subject.</b> <b>The</b> data were spoken and written {{data in the}} form of clauses or sentences collected through the field linguistic method, using direct elicitation supported by interviews. The selected informants were native speakers. The findings show that <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> in <b>the</b> Kemak language has the following characteristics. (1) <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> appears in <b>the</b> pre-verbal position in the canonical structure. (2) An adverb and a negation marker can be inserted between <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> as a pre-verbal argument and the predicate. (3) <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> can be relativized. (4) A floating quantifier can be inserted between subject and predicate. (5) <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> can be made reflexive. (6) Non-subject arguments (direct and indirect objects) can be raised to be a <b>subject</b> through <b>the</b> raising mechanism. (7) <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> can be focused through the presence of the focus marker te ‘that’ which appears directly after <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> (8) <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> can be controlled...|$|R
50|$|In {{sentence}} a, {{the first}} criterion (agreement) {{and the second}} criterion (position occupied) {{suggest that there is}} <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> whereas <b>the</b> third criterion (semantic role) suggests rather that problems is <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> In sentence b, in contrast, agreement and semantic role suggest that problems is <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> whereas position occupied suggests that there is <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> In such cases then, one can take the first criterion as the most telling; <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> should agree with the finite verb.|$|R

25|$|When {{there is}} no {{entrance}} of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and answer material, the composer can develop <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> by altering <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> This is called an episode, often by inversion, although the term is sometimes used synonymously with middle-entry and may also describe the exposition of completely new subjects, as in a double fugue for example (see below). In any of the entries within a fugue <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> may be altered, by inversion, retrograde (a less common form where <b>the</b> entire <b>subject</b> is heard back-to-front) and diminution (the reduction of <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> rhythmic values by a certain factor), augmentation (the increase of <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> rhythmic values by a certain factor) or any combination of them.|$|R

5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of <b>the</b> <b>subjects,</b> as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E

5|$|These {{include two}} images that show <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> standing.

Another image presents <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips.

25|$|The {{predicate}} {{provides information}} about <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> {{such as what}} <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is, what <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is doing, or what <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is like. <b>The</b> relation between a subject and its predicate is sometimes called a nexus. A predicative nominal is a noun phrase, such as in George III is the king of England, the king of England being the predicative nominal. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> and predicative nominal must be connected by a linking verb, also called a copula. A predicative adjective is an adjective, such as in Ivano is attractive, attractive being the predicative adjective. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> and predicative adjective must also be connected by a copula.|$|R
