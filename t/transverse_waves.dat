25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> {{there are many}} wave motions where the oscillation {{is not limited to}} directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.|$|E
25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. It requires a medium to propagate.

40|$|Summary. If thermal and {{mechanical}} coupling is neglected, {{there is a}} class of isothermal strain energy functions for isotropic compressible hyperelastic solids, that admits the propagation of a finite amplitude <b>transverse</b> <b>wave,</b> without a coupled longitudinal wave, and a subclass that admits the simultaneous propagation of an uncoupled finite amplitude <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> and a longitudinal wave [1]. Several examples of this class of strain energy function are discussed. When thermal {{and mechanical}} coupling is considered the solid is described as thermoelastic. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the possibility of the propagation of a finite amplitude <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> without a coupled longitudinal wave, or the uncoupled simultaneous propagation of a finite amplitude <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> and a longitudinal wave, in an isotropic thermoelastic solid that has no underlying deformation. It is shown that an extensive class of isotropic thermoelastic solids does not admit the propagation of an uncoupled finite amplitude <b>transverse</b> <b>wave,</b> with or without an uncoupled longitudinal wave, even if the corresponding hyperelastic solid does. ...|$|R

25|$|Polarization is an {{important}} parameter in areas of science dealing with <b>transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> such as optics, seismology, radio, and microwaves. Especially impacted are technologies such as lasers, wireless and optical fiber telecommunications, and radar.|$|E
25|$|These {{different}} waves (compression {{waves and}} the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an earthquake, where sharp compression waves arrive first, and rocking <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> seconds later.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{carried by}} an {{oscillating}} sound wave converts {{back and forth}} between the potential energy of the extra compression (in case of longitudinal waves) or lateral displacement strain (in case of <b>transverse</b> <b>waves)</b> of the matter, and the kinetic energy of the displacement velocity of particles of the medium.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of polarization arises {{as a consequence}} of the fact that light behaves as a two-dimensional <b>transverse</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{longitudinal}} and <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> velocities propagating into {{aluminum alloy}} A 6061 under simple shear and pure shear were studied experimentally. Compared {{with the same}} velocity change tendencies of <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> under simple shear and pure shear, longitudinal wave velocity shows different change tendencies under both shear states, regardless of the same shear strain states in two cases. Finite element analysis was performed and the analyzed {{results indicate that the}} <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> velocity depends on texture evolutions mainly, whereas the longitudinal wave velocity is sensitively influenced by point defects induced by cross-slips. Consequently, the longitudinal wave velocity showing a sensitive response to the point defects was examined by measuring longitudinal wave velocity changes propagating into Al single crystal subjected to the combination loads of equi-biaxial tension and compression...|$|R
25|$|The new indices s = 1, 2, 3 {{label the}} {{polarization}} of the phonons. In the one-dimensional model, the atoms were restricted to moving along the line, so the phonons corresponded to longitudinal waves. In three dimensions, vibration is {{not restricted to}} the direction of propagation, and can also occur in the perpendicular planes, like <b>transverse</b> <b>waves.</b> This {{gives rise to the}} additional normal coordinates, which, as the form of the Hamiltonian indicates, we may view as independent species of phonons.|$|E
25|$|Polarization is {{a general}} {{property}} of waves that describes {{the orientation of the}}ir oscillations. For <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> such as many electromagnetic waves, it describes the orientation of the oscillations in the plane perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel. The oscillations may be oriented in a single direction (linear polarization), or the oscillation direction may rotate as the wave travels (circular or elliptical polarization). Circularly polarised waves can rotate rightward or leftward in the direction of travel, and which of those two rotations is present in a wave is called the wave's chirality.|$|E
25|$|In other {{departments}} of physics may be mentioned his {{paper on the}} conduction of heat in crystals (1851) and his inquiries in connection with Crookes radiometer; his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside {{the outline of a}} dark body seen against the sky (1883); and, still later, his theory of the x-rays, which he suggested might be <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains. Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and Clairaut's theorem, and the other on the variation of gravity at {{the surface of the earth}} (1849)—also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847) and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850) and his discussion of a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), research related to his evidence given to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures after the Dee bridge disaster of 1847.|$|E

[...] As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. [...] At the surface, clouds of dust can be raised by outflow boundaries. If squall lines form over arid regions, a duststorm known as a haboob can result from the high winds picking up dust in their wake from the desert floor. [...] If outflow boundaries move into areas of the atmosphere which are stable in the low levels, such as over colder pockets of ocean or through the cold sector of extratropical cyclones, they can create a phenomenon known as an undular bore, which shows up on satellite and radar imagery {{as a series of}} <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> in the cloud field oriented perpendicular to the low-level winds.|$|E
2500|$|Incoherent {{isotropic}} radiators {{are possible}} {{and do not}} violate Maxwell's equations. [...] Acoustic isotropic radiators are possible because sound waves in a gas or liquid are longitudinal waves and not <b>transverse</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Polarization (also polarisation) is a {{property}} applying to <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> that specifies the geometrical {{orientation of the}} oscillations. [...] In a transverse wave, {{the direction of the}} oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction. [...] A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling along a taut string (see image); for example, in a musical instrument like a guitar string. Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string. [...] In contrast, in longitudinal waves, such as sound waves in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization. [...] <b>Transverse</b> <b>waves</b> that exhibit polarization include electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves, gravitational waves, and transverse sound waves (shear waves) in solids. [...] In some types of <b>transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> the wave displacement is limited to a single direction, so these also do not exhibit polarization; for example, in surface waves in liquids (gravity waves), the wave displacement of the particles is always in a vertical plane.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{a century}} later, Young and Fresnel revived the wave theory of light when {{they pointed out}} that light could be a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> rather than a {{longitudinal}} wave – the polarization of a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> (like Newton's [...] "sides" [...] of light) could explain birefringence, and {{in the wake of}} a series of experiments on diffraction the particle model of Newton was finally abandoned. Physicists assumed, moreover, that like mechanical waves, light waves required a medium for propagation, and thus required Huygens's idea of an aether [...] "gas" [...] permeating all space.|$|R

40|$|Four {{different}} {{techniques that}} use wave cut analysis {{to predict the}} wave pattern resistance coefficient of a ship hull are compared. Two of the techniques are based on longitudinal wave cuts and two are based on <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> cuts. The results are compared with values from pressure integration and with towing tank measurements of the residuary resistance. Three hulls are used for the comparison: the Dyne Tanker, the Series 60 and the SSPA Ro-Ro Ship model 2062. The wave cuts are computed from linear and non-linear solutions of the wave pattern. A technique whereby the free surface deformation at any distance downstream of a vessel can be predicted very quickly {{based on the information}} computed in one of the <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> cut methods is also described. When used with appropriate wave information, the wave resistance prediction was very consistent for the four different wave cut methods and it was not possible say that one method is better than the other in this respect. The four wave cut methods tested gave the same ranking of the wave resistance for a bulb size variation of the Ro-Ro ship model. This ranking agreed with the ranking from pressure integration and from towing tank measurements. The <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> cut methods seems to be more robust and needs less time for the CFD calculation than the longitudinal wave cut methods which makes them more suitable to include in an automatic optimisation procedure. Single and multiple <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> cuts methods performed equally well for linear computations, but the multiple <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> cut method is preferred for non-linear computations since it is less sensitive to the position of the wave cuts. The wave cut analysis calculates values for the wave resistance that are less than the values obtained from pressure integration and from the residuary resistance as measured in a towing tank...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of an incoming boundary layer to the standing morphology of an oblique detonation wave (ODW) induced by a compression ramp is numerically studied in this paper. The Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model {{is used to}} perform simulation of detonationboundary- layer interactions. Three different wall conditions are applied to realize control on the boundary-layer separation scales. Accordingly, different standing morphologies of the ODWs are obtained, including smooth ODW (without <b>transverse</b> <b>wave)</b> under no-slip, adiabatic wall condition with large-scale separation, abrupt ODW (with <b>transverse</b> <b>wave)</b> under no-slip, cold wall condition with moderate-scale separation, and bow-shaped detached ODW under slipwall condition without a boundary layer...|$|R
2500|$|The sum of two counter-propagating waves (of equal {{amplitude}} and frequency) {{creates a}} standing wave. [...] Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave. [...] For example, when a violin string is displaced, <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> propagate {{out to where}} the string is held {{in place at the}} bridge and the nut, where the waves are reflected back. [...] At the bridge and nut, the two opposed waves are in antiphase and cancel each other, producing a node. Halfway between two nodes there is an antinode, where the two counter-propagating waves enhance each other maximally. There is no net propagation of energy over time.|$|E
2500|$|In a gas or liquid, sound {{consists}} of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A longitudinal wave {{is associated with}} compression and decompression {{in the direction of}} travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the transverse wave, also called a shear wave, occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the [...] "polarization" [...] of this type of wave. In general, <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> occur as a pair of orthogonal polarizations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{phenomenon}} of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two orthogonal directions. <b>Transverse</b> <b>waves</b> can be polarized, for instance. When polarization {{is used as}} a descriptor without qualification, it usually refers to the special, simple case of linear polarization. A transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane. In the case of linear polarization, it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane, perpendicular to the direction of travel, in which the oscillation occurs, such as [...] "horizontal" [...] for instance, if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground. Electromagnetic waves propagating in free space, for instance, are transverse; they can be polarized by the use of a polarizing filter.|$|E
