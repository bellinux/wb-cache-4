40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{hypotheses}} that laser irradiation is equally effective for bonding as traditional acid-etch procedures, and that tooth substrate prepared either by Erbium:YAG laser or diamond bur is equally receptive to adhesive procedures. Buccal/oral enamel and mid-coronal dentin were laser-irradiated using an Erbium:YAG laser. A total-etch adhesive (OptiBond FL) applied with and without prior acid-etching and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond) were employed to bond the composite. The micro-tensile bond strength (microTBS) was determined after 24 h of storage in water. Failure patterns were analysed using a stereo-microscope, and samples were processed for Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (Fe-SEM) evaluation. Unbonded, lased enamel and dentin surfaces were evaluated using Fe-SEM as well. The total-etch adhesive bonded significantly less effectively <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> than <b>to</b> bur-cut enamel/dentin. Laser 'conditioning' was clearly less effective than acid-etching. Moreover, acid etching lased enamel and dentin significantly improved the microTBS of OptiBond FL. The self-etch adhesive performed equally <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> as <b>to</b> bur-cut enamel, but significantly less effectively <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> than <b>to</b> bur-cut dentin. It is concluded that cavities prepared by laser appear less receptive to adhesive procedures than conventional bur-cut cavities. status: publishe...|$|R

A maximum cw output power of nearly 0.5 W has been demonstrated at room temperature, with 200-300 mW in a nearly-diffraction-limited beam. A maximum room-temperature cw wall-plug efficiency of nearly 15% has also been achieved. While QCLs typically require input electrical powers of nearly 1 W and higher to operate at room temperature, ICLs are able <b>to</b> <b>lase</b> for input powers as low as 29 mW owing to the much longer interband carrier lifetime.

5000|$|Injection seeders are {{devices that}} direct {{the output of}} small [...] "seed" [...] lasers into the cavity {{of a much larger}} laser to {{stabilize}} the latter's output. Most seed lasers are stable, single-frequency lasers that emit within the linewidth of the larger laser's gain medium. The single frequency encourages the larger laser <b>to</b> <b>lase</b> in a single longitudinal mode, and the seed laser can also improve the laser's spatial profile and improve the M2 parameter.

Many commercial lasers use a laser diode as a seeding source.|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} {{the transition from}} amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) <b>to</b> <b>lasing</b> in random systems {{with varying degrees of}} mode overlap. This is accomplished by solving the stochastic Maxwell-Bloch equations with the finite-difference time-domain method. Below lasing threshold, the continuous emission spectra are narrowed by frequency-dependent amplification. Our simulations reproduce the stochastic emission spikes in the spectra. Well-defined peaks, corresponding to the system resonances, emerge at higher pumping and are narrowed by stimulated emission before lasing takes place. Noise tends to distribute pump energy over many modes, resulting in multi-mode operation. Well above the lasing threshold, the effects of noise lessen and results become similar to those without noise. By comparing systems of different scattering strength, we find that weaker scattering extends the transition region from ASE <b>to</b> <b>lasing,</b> where the effects of noise are most significant.

5000|$|Blue laser {{pointers}} {{in specific}} wavelengths such as 473 nm usually {{have the same}} basic construction as DPSS green lasers. In 2006 many factories began production of blue laser modules for mass-storage devices, and these were used in laser pointers too. These were DPSS-type frequency-doubled devices. They most commonly emit a beam at 473 nm, which is produced by frequency doubling of 946 nm laser radiation from a diode-pumped Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO4 crystal (Nd-doped crystals usually produce a principal wavelength of 1064 nm, but with the proper reflective coating mirrors can be also made <b>to</b> <b>lase</b> at other [...] "higher harmonic" [...] non-principal neodymium wavelengths). For high output power, BBO crystals are used as frequency doublers; for lower powers, KTP is used. The Japanese company Nichia controlled 80% of the blue-laser-diode market in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Lasers using pure metal vapor {{produced}} from an elemental copper source {{are difficult to}} construct because of the extremely high temperature, about 1500 degrees C, necessary to create such vapor, severely limiting the materials for the vapor containment vessel and mirrors. Copper halides, specifically copper chloride, copper bromide and copper iodide, have been substituted since they form vapors at much lower temperatures, in the range 300-600 degrees C, but operation at such temperatures remains difficult. Copper compound vapors also increase {{the complexity of the}} pump signal applied to the device. Typically, two energizing pulses in quick succession are required, the first to dissociate vapor molecules, and the second to cause the dissociated ions <b>to</b> <b>lase.</b> Operating temperature can be further reduced by the use of copper nitrate or copper acetylacetonate, whose vapors give peak laser output power at 180 and 40 degrees C, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Blue laser pointers, {{which became}} {{available}} around 2006, {{have the same}} basic construction as DPSS green lasers. They most commonly emit light at 473 nm, which is produced by frequency doubling of 946 nm laser radiation from a diode-pumped Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO4 crystal. Neodymium-doped crystals usually produce a principal wavelength of 1064 nm, but with the proper reflective coating mirrors can be also made <b>to</b> <b>lase</b> at other non-principal neodymium wavelengths, such as the 946 nm transition used in blue-laser applications. For high output power BBO crystals are used as frequency doublers; for lower powers, KTP is used. Output powers available are up to 5000 mW. Conversion efficiency for producing 473 nm laser radiation is inefficient {{with some of the}} best lab produced results coming in at 10-15% efficient at converting 946 nm laser radiation to 473 nm laser radiation. In practical applications, one can expect this to be even lower. Due to this low conversion efficiency, use of a 1000 mW IR diode results in at most 150 mW of visible blue light.|$|E
40|$|Recently, the use {{of laser}} {{technology}} {{as an alternative to}} mechanical rotating instruments for cavity preparation has been introduced. Objectives: The hypothesis tested was that laser irradiation is equally effective to pre-treat enamel and dentin as acid-etch procedures. Methods: Buccal/oral enamel and mid-coronal human dentin was laser-irradiated using an Er:YAG laser (λ= 2. 94 µm; Fidelis, Fotona Medical Lasers) set to 10 Hz and 120 mJ for enamel, and 10 Hz and 80 mJ for dentin (settings for enamel and dentin ‘conditioning'). A total-etch adhesive (OptiBond FL, Kerr) with (AE) and without (N-AE) acid-etching and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray) were applied and a composite build-up was made (Z 100). Micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) specimens (2 x 2 x 9 mm) were trimmed into a round cross-sectional interface (± 1 mm 2). The µTBS (MPa) was determined after 24 hours of storage in water at 37 °C. Conclusions: The total-etch adhesive bonded significantly less effective <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> than <b>to</b> bur-cut enamel/dentin. Laser ‘conditioning' was clearly less effective than acid-etching, by which the hypothesis was rejected. Moreover, acid-etching lased enamel and dentin significantly improved the bonding effectiveness of OptiBond FL. The self-etch adhesive bonded equally well <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> as <b>to</b> bur-cut enamel, but significantly less effective <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> than <b>to</b> bur-cut dentin. It is concluded that cavities prepared by laser appear less receptive to adhesive restorations than conventional bur-cut cavities. jan. demunck@med. kuleuven. ac. bestatus: accepte...|$|R

5000|$|Depending on {{the gain}} of the medium, {{the amount of}} light the OC needs to reflect back can vary widely. Helium-neon lasers require around a 99% {{reflective}} mirror <b>to</b> <b>lase,</b> while nitrogen lasers have an extremely high gain (they are [...] "superradiant") and do not require any OC (0% reflective). The reflectivity of any OC will vary with wavelength. Metal-coated mirrors generally have good reflectivity over a wide bandwidth, but may not cover an entire portion of the spectrum. Silver has up to 99.9% reflectivity in the visual range, but is a poor reflector of ultraviolet. Aluminum does not reflect infrared well, but is a good reflector from the visual range through the near-UV, whereas gold is highly reflective to infrared light but a poor reflector of wavelengths shorter than yellow. A dielectric mirror may have a tuning range as low as a 10nm when designed for a specific wavelength, or can be designed with a wide range, spanning as much as 100nm, for tunable lasers. For this reason the spectral properties of the OC are important to consider when a laser cavity is being assembled.|$|E
5000|$|Carl Hoefer {{describes}} Cartwright's {{philosophy in}} the following terms:Nancy Cartwright’s philosophy of science is, in her view, a form of empiricism but empiricism {{in the style of}} Neurath and Mill, rather than of Hume or Carnap. Her concerns are not with the problems of skepticism, induction, or demarcation; she is concerned with how actual science achieves the successes it does, and what sort of metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions are needed to understand that success.Cartwright, like many working scientists themselves, takes a rather pragmatic/realist stance toward observations and interventions made by scientists and engineers and particularly toward their connections to causality: Scientists see impurities causing signal loss in a cable, and they stimulate an inverted population, causing it <b>to</b> <b>lase.</b> Given these starting points, there can be no question of a skeptical attitude toward causation, in either singular or generic form. The fundamental role (or better, roles) played by causation in scientific practice is undeniable; what Cartwright does, then, is reconfigure empiricism from the ground up based on this insight. In the reconfiguration process, many mainstays of the received view of science take a beating; especially ... the fundamentality of laws of nature.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the HeNe gas laser, many other gas discharges have been found to amplify light coherently.Gas lasers using many different gases have been built and used for many purposes. The helium-neon laser (HeNe) is able to operate at a number of different wavelengths, however the vast majority are engineered <b>to</b> <b>lase</b> at 633 nm; these relatively low cost but highly coherent lasers are extremely common in optical research and educational laboratories. Commercial carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers can emit many hundreds of watts in a single spatial mode which can be concentrated into a tiny spot. This emission is in the thermal infrared at 10.6 µm; such lasers are regularly used in industry for cutting and welding. The efficiency of a CO2 laser is unusually high: over 30%. Argon-ion lasers can operate at a number of lasing transitions between 351 and 528.7 nm. Depending on the optical design {{one or more of these}} transitions can be lasing simultaneously; the most commonly used lines are 458 nm, 488 nm and 514.5 nm. A nitrogen transverse electrical discharge in gas at atmospheric pressure (TEA) laser is an inexpensive gas laser, often home-built by hobbyists, which produces rather incoherent UV light at 337.1 nm. Metal ion lasers are gas lasers that generate deep ultraviolet wavelengths. Helium-silver (HeAg) 224 nm and neon-copper (NeCu) 248 nm are two examples. Like all low-pressure gas lasers, the gain media of these lasers have quite narrow oscillation linewidths, less than 3 GHz (0.5 picometers), making them candidates for use in fluorescence suppressed Raman spectroscopy.|$|E
