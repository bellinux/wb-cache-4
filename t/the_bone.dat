5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> as well. This convinced Finkel that <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|For burnt bone, {{testability}} {{depends on}} {{the conditions under which}} <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was burnt. If <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was heated under reducing conditions, it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case the sample is often usable.|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is triangular.|$|E

50|$|In early sarcopterygians {{the skull}} roof was {{composed}} of numerous bony plates, particularly around the nostrils and behind each eye. The skull proper was joined by <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> of <b>the</b> operculum. The skull itself was composed rather loosely, with a joint between <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> covering <b>the</b> brain (<b>the</b> parietal <b>bones</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> behind them) and the snout (<b>the</b> frontal <b>bone,</b> nasal <b>bone</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> in front and {{to the side of}} them). This joint disappeared in the evolving labyrinthodonts, at the same time <b>the</b> number of <b>bones</b> were reduced and the operculum disappeared.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bones</b> {{were removed}} and {{examined}} in 1933, by the archivist of Westminster Abbey, Lawrence Tanner; a leading anatomist, Professor William Wright; {{and the president}} of the Dental Association, George Northcroft. By measuring certain bones and teeth, they concluded <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> belonged to two children around the correct ages for <b>the</b> princes. <b>The</b> <b>bones</b> were found to have been interred carelessly along with chicken and other animal bones. There were also three very rusty nails. One skeleton was larger than the other, but many of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> were missing, including part of the smaller jawbone and all of the teeth from the larger one. Many of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> had been broken by the original workmen. The examination has been criticised, on the grounds that it was conducted under the presumption that <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> were those of the princes and concentrated only on whether <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> showed evidence of suffocation. Thus no attempt was even made to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> were male or female.|$|R
5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} <b>the</b> <b>bone.</b> All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E

5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is more visible on the interior of <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as most likely a specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E

5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E

5|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, {{an island in the}} Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001.

The size and robustness of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was similar to ulnae of the imperial amazon, and though it was worn, the authors identified {{what appeared to be a}} notch, which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona, but not in the genus Ara. Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw.
