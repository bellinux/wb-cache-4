5|$|Bracken {{was elected}} to the Commons in the 1945 general election, and for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years the Tories had their party leader in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives won 67 seats to the Liberals' 125, with smaller parties and independents winning 52 seats.

5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> {{years for the}} office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's {{spinster}} persona, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. The shows were positively received.|$|E

5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, {{and the next day}} it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Since winning {{back-to-back}} Shields in 2006 and 2007, {{the club}} failed {{to qualify for}} the MLS Cup Playoffs five years in a row. During this stretch, United's lone major title came in 2008, when they won the U.S. Open Cup. In league play during the 2008 and 2009 campaigns, United faltered at the tail-end of each season, ultimately causing them to miss out on the playoffs. They had a poor 2010 MLS season, winning only six matches, drawing four and losing 20. In 2011, United again failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in the second to last week of the campaign. In 2012, United returned to the playoffs for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years, clinching a berth in the second-to-last week of the season.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 NHL lockout, which {{cancelled}} {{the full}} 2004–05 NHL season, forced Kesler {{to spend the}} entire season with the Moose.

Midway through the season, Kesler was named to the PlanetUSA All-Star team for the 2005 AHL All-Star Game where he helped PlanetUSA defeat Team Canada for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years. Kesler finished third in team scoring with thirty goals and 57 points to be named the Moose's Most Valuable Player.

5|$|In later seasons, Bergkamp {{established}} himself as a first-team player for Ajax. This culminated in a period of success for the club, which won the Eredivisie title in the 1989–90 season for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years. Bergkamp scored 29 goals in 36 matches the following season and became the joint top goalscorer in the league, sharing the accolade with PSV striker Romário. Ajax won the 1992 UEFA Cup Final, beating Torino through the away goals ruling. They then defeated Heerenveen 6–2 in the final of the KNVB Cup on 20 May 1993.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Bertuzzi {{recorded his}} first career NHL hat trick, recording all three goals {{on the power}} play against San Jose Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov in a 6–3 win on December 30, 2000. Bertuzzi recorded a second consecutive 25-goal season in 2000–01, adding 30 assists for 55 points, third in team scoring behind Näslund and Andrew Cassels. His -18 plus-minus rating, however, was a team-worst. The Canucks continued to improve, qualifying for the post-season for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years. Entering the 2001 playoffs as the final and eighth seed in the West, they were eliminated {{in the first round}} by the Colorado Avalanche. Bertuzzi scored two goals and two assists over four games in his first NHL post-season appearance. In the off-season, Bertuzzi filed for salary arbitration after initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Canucks. Both sides avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year deal on July 26, 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Linden broke {{several more}} Canucks records. In a February 16, 2004, {{game against the}} Colorado Avalanche, he played in his 897th game as a Canuck, passing Smyl.
