5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is {{deployed}} to the Westchester County hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, New York, {{which has been}} plagued by a series of brutal slayings in which <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> found decapitated: Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau), a wealthy farmer; his son Dirk; and the widow Emily Winship. Crane learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless Hessian mercenary (Christopher Walken) from the American Revolutionary War who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.|$|E
5|$|The Mittal Steel company {{purchased}} the Omarska mining complex {{and planned to}} resume extraction of iron ore from the site. Mittal Steel announced in Banja Luka on 1 December 2005 that the company would build and finance a memorial in the 'White House' but the project was later abandoned. Many Bosnian Serbs believe {{there should not be}} a memorial, while many Bosniaks believe that construction should be postponed until all <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> found and only if the entire mine—which is in use—be allocated for the memorial site.|$|E
50|$|In no {{circumstances}} shall <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>be</b> {{considered to have}} given consent if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> under <b>the</b> age of 14 or has a mental disability or illness.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies of}} <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> taken to <b>the</b> Hamilton County Coroner's Office in Cincinnati, where autopsies {{found that all}} but one of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> shot {{multiple}} times.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> casual {{workers and}} either Irish or Romani people. The Romanis were all from one {{extended}} family. <b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged between 59 years and 2 years old.|$|R
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of firedamp.|$|E
5|$|Two {{memorials}} {{to those}} {{who died in the}} crash were established by the Government of Nova Scotia. One is to the east of the crash site at The Whalesback, a promontory one kilometre (0.6mile) north of Peggy's Cove. The second is a more private, but much larger commemoration located west of the crash site near Bayswater Beach Provincial Park on the Aspotogan Peninsula in Bayswater. Here, the unidentified remains of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> interred. A fund was established to fund maintenance of the memorials and the government passed an act to recognize them. Various other charitable funds were also created, including one {{in the name of a}} young victim from Louisiana, Robert Martin Maillet, which provides money for children in need.|$|E
5000|$|Worker on worker (Type III) - {{both the}} aggressor and <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>are</b> {{employees}} in <b>the</b> same organization. Often, the aggressor is a supervisor, and <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a subordinate.|$|R
50|$|Ingestion: <b>The</b> <b>victim’s</b> mouth should <b>be</b> rinsed at first. <b>The</b> <b>victim</b> should <b>be</b> given {{charcoal}} as a slurry (240 ml water/30 g charcoal). This is {{only possible}} when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> conscious.|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{abuse in}} the first degree is a Class D felony if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> 12 to 17 years old, and a Class C felony if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> under 12.|$|R
5|$|When a storm begins, {{the crew}} start to set sail. Toby drops a {{polished}} crown while bringing his father a coat. The Siren is summoned and takes Toby. Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that the Siren has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> not dead, the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get the Siren to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible {{in the same spot}} the pirate ship is located.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E

50|$|In pimp-{{controlled}} trafficking, <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> {{controlled by}} a single pimp. <b>The</b> <b>victim</b> can <b>be</b> controlled by the pimp physically, psychologically, and/or emotionally.|$|R
50|$|Juan Corona {{had been}} {{supplying}} workers to the ranches where <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discovered. He housed {{a lot of}} the men that worked for him in a bunkhouse on the Sullivan Ranch, where most of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discovered.|$|R
25|$|The Messel pit fossil {{deposits}} of Messel, Germany, show {{evidence of a}} limnic eruption there in the early Eocene. Among <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> perfectly preserved insects, frogs, turtles, crocodiles, birds, anteaters, insectivores, early primates and paleotheres.|$|E
25|$|Each year on {{the anniversary}} of the crash, those who died are mourned in a {{ceremony}} on the Marshall University campus in Huntington, West Virginia. A number of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> buried in a grave site in the Spring Hill Cemetery in Huntington; 20th Street, the road that leads from the cemetery to the campus, was renamed Marshall Memorial Boulevard in their honor.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that a specific group of women and girls are being targeted in Ciudad Juárez. The victims share common characteristics, {{and there are many}} similarities in the violent crimes committed against them. Most of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> young women who come from impoverished backgrounds and work in maquiladoras, as factory workers, in other sectors of the informal economy, or are students.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, about 7,314 rape {{cases were}} {{reported}}, {{a rate of}} 9 per 100,000 people. 96.1% of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> female. In 2011, there were about 7,539 reported cases of rape. 70% of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged 21 to 40.|$|R
25|$|A month earlier, President of Defend International {{dedicated}} her 2014 International Pfeffer Peace Award to the Yazidis, Christians and {{all residents}} of Kobane because, she said, {{facts on the}} ground demonstrate that these peaceful people are not safe in their enclaves, partly because of their ethnic origin and/or religion and they are therefore in urgent need for immediate attention from the global community. She asked the international community to make sure that <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> not forgotten; they should be rescued, protected, fully assisted and compensated fairly.|$|E
25|$|Whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) is {{the third}} most common STH-causing {{nematode}} in humans. According to current estimate, nearly 800 million people are infected, and majority of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> children. Heavy infections could lead to acute symptoms such as diarrhoea and anaemia, and chronic symptoms such as growth retardation and impaired cognitive development. Medical conditions are more often serious since coinfection with protozoan parasites such as Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica, and with other nematodes is common. Predominantly a tropical disease of developing countries, trichuriasis is quite common in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Women and {{children}} experiencing domestic violence undergo occupational apartheid; they are typically {{denied access to}} desired occupations. Abusive partners may limit occupations and create an occupationally void environment which reinforces feelings of low self-worth and poor self-efficacy in ability to satisfactorily perform everyday tasks. In addition, work is impacted by functional losses, ability to maintain necessary employment skills, and ability to function within the work place. Oftentimes <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> very isolated from other relationships as well such as having few to no friends, this is another method of control for the abuser.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a law {{enforcement}} officer engaged in the lawful performance {{of his or her}} official duties as a {{law enforcement}} officer and the offender knew or reasonably should have known that <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> {{a law enforcement}} officer.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> exhumed from <b>the</b> {{original}} {{place of burial}} on 16 March 2006.

The girls mother and father were also killed. Most of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> not identifiable because their bodies had burnt so badly.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> {{given an}} {{opportunity}} to profit from a scheme. <b>The</b> <b>victim's</b> greed <b>is</b> encouraged, such that their rational judgment of the situation might be impaired.|$|R
25|$|Since {{only a small}} {{percentage}} of acts of sexual violence are brought to the attention of the authorities, it is difficult to compile accurate rape statistics. Conviction rates differ by the gender of both the perpetrator and victim. Various studies argue that male-male and female-female prison rape are quite common and may be the least reported form of rape. Furthermore, a large number of rape cases take place when <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> below the age of consent, bringing in the issue of child sexual abuse or statutory rape.|$|E
25|$|Several {{memorial}} sites {{associated with}} the Rwandan genocide have begun generate significant tourism. For example, the Gisozi Genocide Memorial Site in the Gasabo District of Kigali—the burial place of approximately 300,000 victims of the genocide—has a related genocide exhibition area and library and has plans to develop a teaching center {{on the history of}} the genocide. Another major genocide-related memorial center attracting tourists is the Murambi Genocide Memorial Site housed in the former Murambi Technical School where 45,000 were murdered and 850 skeletons and mummified remains of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> on display.|$|E
25|$|After dwindling ratings again, {{the show}} made its craziest decision. All <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> brought back alive on the {{tropical}} Island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards). The fired actors (James Reynolds, Suzanne Rogers, Matthew Ashford, Alexis Thorpe, Josh Taylor, Peggy McCay, Frances Reid, Thaao Penghlis and Deidre Hall) all {{returned to their}} original roles. There was also another twist, the killer wasn't Marlena. Stefano DiMera's nephew, Andre (posing as Tony DiMera) had kidnapped them and made Marlena think she was killing off her friends and family. The storyline was incredibly controversial, and garnered the soap a lot of press.|$|E
50|$|All <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{found in}} vacant buildings, {{all had been}} raped and strangled. Most {{of them had been}} murdered in Highland Park. Many of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> working as prostitutes, and Atkins said he was {{motivated}} by a hatred of prostitution.|$|R
50|$|Min was {{restrained}} at {{the primary}} school, and transferred to police custody. <b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> treated at three hospitals.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the impact of gender, victim job performance, and victim employment status on individual juror and jury perceptions of sexual harassment. Gender, victim job performance, and <b>victim</b> employment <b>are</b> all extralegal factors that were found to influence individual jurors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of sexual harassment. The present study revealed individual female jurors {{were more likely than}} male jurors to find sexual harassment. Although gender did not have a significant effect in jury perceptions of sexual harassment, further analysis revealed females were more likely than males to change their decision on sexual harassment in a jury. Victim job performance and employment status were both found to influence jury perceptions of sexual harassment. When <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good, average performer, or no information <b>was</b> provided on <b>victim</b> job performance, <b>the</b> individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a poor performer. When <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good or poor performer or no information <b>was</b> provided for <b>victim</b> job performance, <b>the</b> jury was more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> an average performer. Individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed or no information was provided than when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> fired from <b>the</b> organization. Juries were more likely to perceive sexual harassment when no employment information was provided than when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed fired. These results have implications for the legal system...|$|R
