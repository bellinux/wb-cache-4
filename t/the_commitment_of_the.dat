The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see-saw fashion, raging back and forth, but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress, and the Egyptian paratroopers were firmly in control of Touscan. According to Trevor N. Dupuy, by this time Israeli artillery fire had made the main Cairo-Ismailia road unusable.|$|E

Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a white Nordic cross on a blue and red background as its flag. To demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saar {{to be a part of}} West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the Saarland as a state of West Germany.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Mackay studied {{physics at}} the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford before {{returning}} to Australia and his old job as a lecturer at the University of Sydney. From 1933 to 1940 he was headmaster of Cranbrook School, Sydney. He remained in the Militia between the wars, and was a major general {{by the time the}} Second World War broke out. He was selected to command the 6th Division in 1940, and led it through the Australian Army's first battles of the war. Any doubts about his ability soon disappeared with <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division to the Western Desert Campaign. During the Battle of Bardia in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. In the Battle of Greece, he became the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle. He suffered a series of reverses in Greece, but impressed the troops under his command with his courage under fire. He was recalled to Australia in 1941 to serve as General Officer Commanding Home Forces. On 6 April 1942, he assumed command of the Second Army. During 1943 he twice commanded New Guinea Force in the fighting in the New Guinea campaign. His active service ended with his appointment as High Commissioner to India in November 1943.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel, however, {{was still}} {{disappointed}} with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy. In February 1918, the EEF {{began a series of}} operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time. In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan. Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of Spahis and Chasseurs d'Afrique.|$|E

25|$|The only {{currency}} {{strong enough}} to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the U.S. dollar.

25|$|Resolution of {{the tension}} causing this type of {{neurosis}} involves a careful constructive study of the fantasies.

25|$|Their initial {{reception}} was unpromising, {{both the}} MacLeods and MacDonalds advising Charles {{to return to}} France.

Charles' force now totalled about 1,000 and on 19th August he launched the rebellion with the raising of the Royal Standard at Glenfinnan.

The most prominent of these was Lord George Murray, an experienced soldier previously pardoned by the government for his participation in the 1715 and 1719 risings.

25|$|Field {{hockey is}} the second most popular team {{recreational}} sport in the United Kingdom. The Great Britain men's team won the hockey tournament at the 1988 Olympics, while the women's team repeated the success in the 2016 Games. However British hockey has struggled at time, partly because of conflicts between the need to foster a combined team to compete in the Olympics, and <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hockey associations of each of the home nations to the retention of separate national teams to compete in other international competitions. It also suffers {{due to the lack of}} television of coverage, relative to its participation level, although the success of the women's team in 2016 has raised the profile of the sport, the women's side and a number of the team's star players, notably captain Kate Richardson-Walsh and goalkeeper Maddie Hinch.|$|E
25|$|Stutterheim was {{promoted}} to General-Major on 24 October 1805 during the War of the Third Coalition. At the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, he led a cavalry brigade in Michael von Kienmayer's Advance Guard column. His command included eight squadrons of the O'Reilly Chevau-lÃ©ger Regiment Nr. 3, about 900 sabers, and 40 troopers of the Merveldt Uhlan Regiment Nr. 1. Kienmayer's force was assigned to clear the village of Telnice (Tellnitz) of the French. Before 8:00 AM, the Austrians bumped into several companies of French infantry deployed outside of Telnice. Kienmayer ordered one battalion of the 1st Szekler Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 14 to attack a vineyard-covered hill on which the French were posted. The first battalion soon lost half its strength, forcing <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second battalion to the fight. Johann Nepomuk von Nostiz-Rieneck guarded the right flank with the Hessen-Homburg Hussar Regiment Nr. 4, while Moritz Liechenstein protected the left flank with the Szekler Hussar Regiment Nr. 11.

During the Battle of Bardia, in Libya in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. For this success, Mackay was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In a war of rapid movement over long distances, Mackay demonstrated careful planning and recognised the need to reinforce success. He also impressed others {{with the way he}} cared for soldiers' lives. [...] "Not only do I want Tobruk quickly", he told his brigadiers before the battle, [...] "but I also want it cheaply". The victory at Bardia was followed by successes at Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, Daltrey and Townshend {{disagreed}} {{about the}} band's future and criticised each other via interviews {{in the music}} paper New Musical Express. Daltrey was grateful that the Who had saved him from {{a career as a}} sheet-metal worker and was unhappy at Townshend not playing well; Townshend felt <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group prevented him from releasing solo material. The next album, The Who by Numbers, had introspective songs from Townshend that dealt with disillusionment such as [...] "However Much I Booze" [...] and [...] "How Many Friends"; they resembled his later solo work. Entwistle's [...] "Success Story" [...] gave a humorous look at the music industry, and [...] "Squeeze Box" [...] was a hit single. The group toured from October, playing little new material and few Quadrophenia numbers, and reintroducing several from Tommy. The American leg of the tour began in Houston to a crowd of 18,000 at The Summit Arena, and was supported by Toots and the Maytals. On 6 December 1975, the Who set the record for largest indoor concert at the Pontiac Silverdome, attended by 78,000. On 31 May 1976, they played a second concert at the Valley which was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's loudest concert at over 120dB.
