[...] Nick Gillespie of Reason called Daniels [...] "a smart and effective leader who is a serious thinker about history, politics, and policy," [...] and wrote that [...] "Daniels, like former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, is a Republican {{who knows how to}} govern and can do it well." [...] In February 2011, David Brooks of The New York Times described Daniels as the [...] "Party's strongest [...] candidate", predicting that he [...] "couldn't match Obama in grace and elegance, but he could on substance." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{supporters}} {{felt that}} he had [...] "been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug Baldwin", but many members of the establishment were relieved by Edward's departure. Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward's [...] "sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years" [...] and, upon receiving news of Edward's final decision to abdicate, [...] "if that is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne." [...] Edward's own Assistant Private Secretary, Alan Lascelles, had told Baldwin as early as 1927: [...] "I can't help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him, and to the country, would be for him to break his neck." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 6, 1960, Cooper {{was awarded}} a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his {{contribution}} to the film industry. He was also awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana. On May 6, 1961, {{he was awarded the}} French Order of Arts and Letters in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts. On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the David di Donatello Special Award in Italy for his career achievements. In 1966, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the 25 male stars of classic Hollywood. Three of his characters—Will Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant York—made AFI's list of the one hundred greatest heroes and villains, all of them as heroes. His Lou Gehrig line, [...] "Today, I consider myself the luckiest man {{on the face of the}} earth.", is ranked by AFI as the thirty-eighth greatest movie quote of all time. More than a half century after his death, Cooper's enduring legacy, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, is his image of the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances. Charlton Heston once observed, [...] "He projected <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> Americans would like to be, probably more than any actor that's ever lived." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, The Washington Post named Snow one of {{the three}} {{greatest}} football players to have played in the West, along with Walter Eckersall and Willie Heston. [...] The Post opined that Snow was an end quite worthy to rank with the great ends of the East and that he [...] "was just <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who would have been suited to the advanced requirements of the new game and its additional demand for alertness, in an end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roman consul Scipio Aemilianus {{questioned}} {{one of his}} opponents, P.

2500|$|The {{proposed}} execution raised considerable anxiety, {{given that}} {{it was to be}} in an area congested by working men (exactly <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> to whom Despard had appealed) and the chief magistrate, Sir Richard Ford, expressed his concern over the size of the crowds that assembled during the day and evenings near the jail. [...] He had trouble hiring workmen to build the scaffold; the jailer feared to leave the safety of the prison; and he deployed over 100 armed soldiers throughout the neighbourhood on the night before the execution. [...] Handbills calling on the people to rise had been distributed and the authorities feared the possibility of a riot, if not an outright attempt to free the prisoners. [...] The prisoners remained recalcitrant, especially Despard, refusing to discuss their plans or to reveal the identities of any others who might {{have been involved in the}} plot.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{describe}} Mark as [...] "a carefree rogue, a {{wild child}} of the 60's. He's a rolling stone, always looking for an excuse {{to go on the}} run." [...] Deemed by The Times to be [...] "flaky, irresponsible, and untrustworthy", Powell has assessed of his character [...] "he's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who is constantly in trouble. Mark's not malicious - he's worked as a nurse all his life - but he's certainly unreliable", imparting that he feels Mark as a phobia of authority. Although Powell stated in 2005 that Mark loved his wife and daughter dearly, he elaborated that: [...] "He's a man to whom everything seems like a good idea at the time! Tends to avoid confrontation but this is probably because he is beset by women!" [...] In 2008, a year after Tricia's death, the character referred to himself on-screen as [...] "By day, fearless Consultant Nurse. By night, lonely old fart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are entirely}} subversive of the {{principles}} of American government, to say the least," [...] replied Austen, grimly.

2500|$|John F. Montgomery, {{who served}} in Budapest as U.S. {{ambassador}} from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the Budapest opera house by chanting [...] "Justice for Szálasi!" [...] loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went {{to take a closer}} look, he discovered that:two or three men were on the floor and he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.|$|E
2500|$|The two Natures {{and the two}} Reasons imply two societies. Edmund is the New Man, {{a member}} of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in {{contrast}} with the older society which has come down from the Middle Ages, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. King Lear is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new Machiavellianism; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king's rejected daughter. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an ethical principle (love); and a community. Nevertheless, Shakespeare's understanding of the New Man is so extensive as to amount almost to sympathy. Edmund is the last great expression in Shakespeare of that side of Renaissance individualism – the energy, the emancipation, the courage – which has made a positive contribution to the heritage of the West. [...] "He embodies something vital which a final synthesis must reaffirm. But he makes an absolute claim which Shakespeare will not support. It is right for man to feel, as Edmund does, that society exists for man, not man for society. It is not right to assert <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> Edmund would erect to this supremacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maugham's father, Robert Ormond Maugham, was {{a lawyer}} who handled the legal affairs of the British embassy in Paris. Since French law {{declared}} that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service, his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy, technically on British soil. His grandfather, another Robert, was a prominent lawyer and co-founder of the Law Society of England and Wales. Maugham refers to this grandfather's writings in Chapter 6 his literary memoir, The Summing Up: [...] "...in the catalogue of the Library at the British Museum {{there is a long}} list of his legal works. [...] He wrote only one book that was not of this character. [...] It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. I once had the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it and I {{have not been able to}} get hold of a copy since. [...] I wish I had, for I might have learnt from it something of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he was." [...] His family assumed Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, Viscount Maugham, enjoyed a distinguished legal career and served as Lord Chancellor from 1938 to 1939.|$|E
