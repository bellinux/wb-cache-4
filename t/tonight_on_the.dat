[...] It probably was the worst defeat the Navy ever has suffered on land or sea." [...] Vidmer added that the Michigan squad played [...] "like one big monster" [...] and opined that the team would probably {{go down in history as}} Fielding Yost's masterpiece. [...] Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry also employed a naval metaphor: [...] "Under a maze of forward pass plays, double passes, delayed passes, and criss-cross, Uncle Sam's proud gridiron dreadnaught, rocked by a great Michigan tidal wave, limped into port <b>tonight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leeward side of a 54 to 0 score." [...] Crusinberry opined that Michigan had [...] "played more new football [...] [...] [...] than any team ever did in one game" [...] and declared quarterback Benny Friedman the star of the game:"If any one man stood out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball. [...] And it was Benny who was the field general. [...] His selections of plays was something that would make any general envious." ...|$|E

2500|$|NBC was not {{prepared}} to replace both Letterman and Late Night. Aside from the name, it needed to build a new show. Both Dana Carvey and Garry Shandling declined to host it. Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels was brought in to develop the new show and comedians Jon Stewart, Drew Carey, and Paul Provenza auditioned to host. Michaels suggested to Conan O'Brien, an unknown writer for The Simpsons and former writer for Saturday Night Live, that he should audition for the job. Despite having [...] "about 40 seconds" [...] of television-performance experience as an occasional extra on Saturday Night Live sketches, O'Brien auditioned for the show on April 13, 1993. His guests were Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers, and the audition took place on the set of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. O'Brien was offered the show on April 26, and made his first meaningful television appearance later that day when Leno introduced him on <b>Tonight.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> final episode of his 16-year run, O'Brien stated that he [...] "owed his career to Lorne Michaels." ...|$|E

And from far Japan, in these {{first days of}} the twentieth century, writes one Tomoyoshi Murai: [...] "The interest of our people on Socialism has been greatly awakened these days, especially among our laboring people on one hand and young students' circle on the other, {{as much as we can}} draw an earnest and enthusiastic audience and fill our hall, which holds two thousand. [...] . It is gratifying to say that we have a number of fine and well-trained public orators among our leaders of Socialism in Japan. The first speaker tonight is Mr. Kiyoshi Kawakami, editor of one of our city (Tokyo) dailies, a strong, independent, and decidedly socialistic paper, circulated far and wide. Mr. Kawakami is a scholar as well as a popular writer. He is going to speak <b>tonight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, 'The Essence of Socialism--the Fundamental Principles.' The next speaker is Professor Iso Abe, president of our association, whose subject of address is, 'Socialism and the Existing Social System.' The third speaker is Mr. Naoe Kinosita, the editor of another strong journal of the city. He speaks on the subject, 'How to Realize the Socialist Ideals and Plans.' Next is Mr. Shigeyoshi Sugiyama, a graduate of Hartford Theological Seminary and an advocate of Social Christianity, who is to speak on 'Socialism and Municipal Problems.' And the last speaker is the editor of the 'Labor World,' the foremost leader of the labor-union movement in our country, Mr. Sen Katayama, who speaks on the subject, 'The Outlook of Socialism in Europe and America.' These addresses are going to be published in book form and to be distributed among our people to enlighten their minds on the subject." ...|$|E
