5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan.</b> <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E
5|$|In a {{surprise}} announcement in London on 8 September the South African Minister of Sport and Recreation Fikile Mbalula said that Paralympic medal winners and their coaches would {{receive the same}} performance bonuses that their Olympic counterparts were promised. The amounts initially promised were significantly lower. The minister said <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was discriminatory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2006, Shelbourne Development issued two {{separate}} press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire. A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June 2007. In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that {{the design of the}} building had been revised. This included the removal of the hotel and the antenna mast, making the building consist solely of condominium units. The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan.</b> Additionally, the spire no longer tapered at the top, resulting in an increase in floor space and overall floor count. The revision also removed the separate parking structure from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan,</b> instead incorporating underground parking into the spire itself. This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics and city officials.|$|E

5|$|Kevin Nash was {{released}} from the hospital following Bound for Glory.

5|$|The New England Quarter is a mixed-use {{development}} {{in the city of}} Brighton and Hove, England. It was built between 2004 and 2008 on the largest brownfield site in the city, adjacent to Brighton railway station. Most parts of the scheme have been finished, but other sections are still being built and one major aspect of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was refused planning permission.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 Peace Agreement between Israel and Jordan it {{was decided}} that {{operations}} were supposed to be transferred from Eilat Airport to Aqaba Airport. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was to rename Aqaba Airport as Aqaba-Eilat Peace International Airport. The agreement was never followed, however, and an agreement between the two countries in March 1997, stipulated that domestic flights would continue to use Eilat Airport, whilst no further action to move international flights took place.|$|E

5|$|The Institute of Directors {{was founded}} in 1903 and {{received}} a royal charter in 1906. The former branch of the Midland Bank at Nos.69–70 Pall Mall was designed by Edwin Lutyens and constructed between 1922 and 1927. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> to redevelop No.70 proved impractical so the two premises were demolished to provide a site for the current premises. The cigarette manufacturer Rothmans have their head office at No65 Pall Mall, in a building designed by Norman Shaw, while P Ferries' main administrative office is at No79.|$|E
5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{began as}} a highway {{proposed}} in the Metropolitan Region Scheme in the mid-1950s. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> took the route, then known as Yanchep Highway, inland from what {{is now known as}} Karrinyup Road to the intersection of Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Road. However, the first gazetted edition of the Metropolitan Region Scheme, from 1963, shows a controlled-access highway along the current freeway alignment. The later plan only detailed the route up until a point east of Sorrento, at a proposed east-west controlled-access highway on the modern day Hepburn Avenue alignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E

5|$|The modern city of Ashdod {{city was}} built outside the {{historic}} settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan. The planners divided the city into seventeen neighborhoods of {{ten to fifteen}} thousand people. Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city. Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, and health and education infrastructure. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> also called for a business and administrative center, built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> {{conceived}} by Alléon de Valcourt in 1749 {{was to build}} a canal that would link the upper Loire to the Rhone. The route would run through the Gier basin from Givors on the Rhone {{most of the way}} to Saint-Étienne, then through the Saint-Étienne basin to Saint-Just on the Loire. It was sometimes called the Canal des Deux-Mers (Two-Seas Canal) since it would link the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> for SummerSlam was {{to bring}} Ric Flair over from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) to the WWF. Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} WWF, wanted Flair to {{challenge}} Savage in the main event for the WWF Championship. Flair, however, felt obliged to the NWA and did not leave the promotion for the WWF. Therefore, Hogan and Savage were paired together to end their feuds with their respective on-screen rivals. Flair would not join the WWF until 1991.|$|E

5|$|The scheme has {{attracted}} criticism from various sources, and certain aspects and proposals {{have been particularly}} controversial. A planned 42-storey hotel and residential building on one block—which was not in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> and for which planning permission was later denied—was opposed by many local people and politicians, and was eventually rejected by a government minister on appeal. The decision to allow a large supermarket branch {{to be built in}} the middle of the development was also unpopular. A campaign group was formed to co-ordinate and raise the awareness of people's concerns.|$|E
5|$|The two {{auxiliary}} {{buildings on}} the plaza are used by the American Legion. Both buildings were constructed from Indiana limestone in neoclassical style, similar to the public library just to the north. The east building at Meridian and St. Clair, designated building B on <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan,</b> houses the Indiana Department of the American Legion, the American Legion Auxiliary, and the National Forty and Eight. The four-story building served as the national headquarters until the second building was completed.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Sharon arrived {{after missing}} the entire conference. Speaking with Gonen {{and the other}} commanders after Elazar had left, Sharon {{recommended}} an immediate assault to relieve the beleaguered strongpoints. Gonen pointed out that this had been the Israeli course of action for the past 14–16 hours, to no avail. However he did not reject Sharon outright, and indeed told him to prepare for such an attack, promising a final decision on the matter before 6:00 at dawn. Nevertheless, Sharon would conform to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> for a limited attack on the following day.|$|E

5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> for Regional Eurostar {{services}} to destinations north of London was abandoned, the significantly improved journey times available since {{the opening of}} High Speed 1 — which is physically connected to both the East Coast Main Line and the North London Line (for the West Coast Main Line) at St Pancras — and the recently increased maximum speeds on the West Coast Main Line may make potential Regional Eurostar services more commercially viable. This {{would be even more}} likely if proposals are adopted for a new high-speed line from London to the north of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>plan</b> {{had been}} to {{demolish}} the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E
