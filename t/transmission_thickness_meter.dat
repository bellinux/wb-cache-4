40|$|Abstract: Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastics (CFRP) {{are more and}} more used in aerospace applications because of their potential to considerably reduce the weight. Using CFRP, however, the problem occurs that at painted parts the paint thickness has to be measured non-destructively. Traditional procedures come to their limits because the substrate is only medium conducting and furthermore anisotropic. Therefore a mobile paint <b>thickness</b> <b>meter</b> had been developed to measure the paint thickness on plane samples of CFRP, CFRP with copper mesh, and metal. The present paper extends this development to measurements on curved surfaces. This method consists of two steps. In a first step the average liftoff is determined, which occurs when the plane probe is placed on the curved surface. This first step is also performed with the paint <b>thickness</b> <b>meter.</b> In a second step the paint thickness measurement is performed as on plane surfaces. This gives raw data, from which the average liftoff has to be subtracted. The result is the paint thickness on the curved surface. An example is given. 1...|$|R

The crack on the external {{surface of the}} pipe elbow was revealed. Macrodelamination was occurred in the steel being influenced by the joined action of working loads and hydrogen absorbed by metal during long-term operation. The causes of the material degradation were investigated by non-destructive testing using ultrasound <b>thickness</b> <b>meter,</b> observing microstructure, hydrostatic pressure testing, and mechanical properties testing of pipe steel. Intensive degradation of steel, primarily essential reduction of plasticity was revealed. The degradation degree of the pipe elbow steel was higher than of the straight pipe steel regardless of a section was tensioned or compressed. Basing on the tensile tests carried out on cylindrical smooth and notched specimens from the pipe elbow steel it was established that the plasticity of the damaged steel could be measured correctly only on the specimens with a circular notch due to concentration of deformation in the cross section location only. The limitations in using elongation and reduction in area for characterisation of plasticity of the pipe steel with extensive delamination were defined. The diagnostic features of macrodelamination, namely an abnormal <b>thickness</b> <b>meter</b> readings and a sharp decrease in hardness and plasticity of the pipe elbow steel were established...|$|R
