Stakeholders in {{the built environment}} are being forced at an extensive and unprecedented pace to improve a set of conflicting objectives. On one hand, they want to enhance the cost efficiency and economic sustainability of their constructions. On the other hand, the market demands that the functional performance, indoor quality, comfort levels and social sustainability of the building shall be increased. And at the same time, building professionals concentrate on the reduction of energy consumption, the ecological footprint of a building process and its carbon emission, boosting the environmental sustainability.

Since India is a developing country, we constantly work towards improving our infrastructure and technology {{to meet the demands}} of our scientists and researchers by taking the lead from the developed countries. By utilizing the support of the regional & national level networking, libraries in India should cooperatively establish library consortia for offering and sharing electronic resources.

These networks can be expanded to enhance the access to the information resources through collaborative partnerships, in the form of Consortia. Since this Consortia idea is still at a nascent stage in Indian libraries, it is essential to have some ideal Consortia models for our libraries to adhere to for optimum utilization of their resources and services. Today Consortium's purpose is shifted from mere sharing of resources to sharing of expertise between libraries and also to explore the need for libraries to make the most effective use of their funds collectively.

Volume {{rendering}} {{has been}} a relevant topic in scientific visualization for the last <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> A <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> the exploration of reasonably big volume datasets required costly workstations due to the high processing cost {{of this kind of}} visualization. In the last years, a high end PC or laptop was {{enough to be able to}} handle medium-sized datasets thanks specially to the fast evolution of GPU hardware. New embedded CPUs that sport powerful graphics chipsets make complex 3 D applications feasible in such devices. However, besides the much marketed presentations and all its hype, no real empirical data is usually available that makes comparing absolute and relative capabilities possible. In this paper we analyze current graphics hardware in most high-end Android mobile devices and perform a practical comparison of a well-known GPU-intensive task: volume rendering. We analyze different aspects by implementing three different classical algorithms and show how the current state-of-the art mobile GPUs behave in volume rendering. ...|$|R
