500|$|A small copy of {{the ring}} was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter, [...] "The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the {{consequence}} was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> greatest difficulty {{to take it off}} again, which I at last did with great pain". In fact, the ring had been sized to fit the queen's little finger instead of her ring finger due to a misunderstanding by the jewellers. It was left to the Crown upon her death in 1901 and is on display at the Tower of London.|$|E
500|$|David Silverman {{describes}} the episode as [...] "one of my very favorite episodes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pleasure to direct". He notes that several [...] "standard Homerisms" [...] appear {{for the first}} time in the episode, such as Homer's conversations with his brain and his high-pitched [...] "fairy voice". Silverman inserted a red herring into the episode in a scene where Mr. Burns says that he was rejuvenated. Silverman used a close-up of Burns when he says [...] "blood of a young boy" [...] in hopes of misleading viewers into thinking that the rest of episode would be about Burns seeking more of Bart's blood.|$|E

I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to my record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal.

500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, because I {{feel that it}} is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E
500|$|LeMond's first {{professional}} victory came three months into his 1981 debut {{when he won}} a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic road champion. The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race where LeMond placed third. The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later Simon was assessed a 10-minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race {{to have been a}} [...] "major steppingstone" [...] in his career. Said LeMond: [...] "It showed me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races." [...] LeMond won a total of five races in his rookie season of 1981.|$|E

I had come in contact with many Jain friends and scholars, but until then, excepting a few, I had not come across any scholar who was as non-sectarian or fearless as Premiji. So I had developed the perception {{that it was impossible to}} find a Jain scholar who was non-sectarian as well as fearless. Premiji's writings gradually made me realise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> wrong notion. This was the foremost reason for me to be attracted towards him.|$|E

In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, [...] " [...] knew within a few hours <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> key to my whole career in hand". In that same year, Krugman wrote [...] "The Theory of Interstellar Trade", a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was [...] "an oppressed assistant professor".|$|E
