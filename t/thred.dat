60|$|Sometimes {{instead of}} the Paper I used a white <b>Thred,</b> and this {{appeared}} through the Prism divided into two parallel Threds as is represented in the nineteenth Figure, where DG denotes the <b>Thred</b> illuminated with violet Light from D to E and with red Light from F to G, and defg are {{the parts of the}} <b>Thred</b> seen by Refraction. If one half of the <b>Thred</b> be constantly illuminated with red, and the other half be illuminated with all the Colours successively, (which may be done by causing one of the Prisms to be turned about its Axis whilst the other remains unmoved) this other half in viewing the <b>Thred</b> through the Prism, will appear in a continual right Line with the first half when illuminated with red, and begin to be a little divided from it when illuminated with Orange, and remove farther from it when illuminated with yellow, and still farther when with green, and farther when with blue, and go yet farther off when illuminated with Indigo, and farthest when with deep violet. Which plainly shews, that the Lights of several Colours are more and more refrangible one than another, in this Order of their Colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, deep violet; and so proves as well the first Proposition as the second.|$|E

60|$|Obs. 1. I {{made in a}} {{piece of}} Lead a small Hole with a Pin, whose breadth was the 42d part of an Inch. For 21 of those Pins laid {{together}} took up the breadth of half an Inch. Through this Hole I let into my darken'd Chamber a beam of the Sun's Light, and found that the Shadows of Hairs, <b>Thred,</b> Pins, Straws, and such like slender Substances placed in this beam of Light, were considerably broader than they ought to be, if the Rays of Light passed on by these Bodies in right Lines. And particularly a Hair of a Man's Head, whose breadth was but the 280th part of an Inch, being held in this Light, at the distance of about twelve Feet from the Hole, did cast a Shadow which at the distance of four Inches from the Hair was the sixtieth part of an Inch broad, that is, above four times broader than the Hair, and at the distance of two Feet from the Hair was about the eight and twentieth part of an Inch broad, that is, ten times broader than the Hair, and at the distance of ten Feet was the eighth part of an Inch broad, that is 35 times broader.|$|E
60|$|Exper. 2. About the {{aforesaid}} Paper, whose two halfs {{were painted}} over {{with red and}} blue, and which was stiff like thin Pasteboard, I lapped several times a slender <b>Thred</b> of very black Silk, in such manner that the several parts of the <b>Thred</b> might appear upon the Colours like so many black Lines drawn over them, or like long and slender dark Shadows cast upon them. I might have drawn black Lines with a Pen, but the Threds were smaller and better defined. This Paper thus coloured and lined I set against a Wall perpendicularly to the Horizon, so {{that one of the}} Colours might stand to the Right Hand, and the other to the Left. Close before the Paper, at the Confine of the Colours below, I placed a Candle to illuminate the Paper strongly: For the Experiment was tried in the Night. The Flame of the Candle reached up to the lower edge of the Paper, or a very little higher. Then at the distance of six Feet, and one or two Inches from the Paper upon the Floor I erected a Glass Lens four Inches and a quarter broad, which might collect the Rays coming from the several Points of the Paper, and make them converge towards so many other Points at the same distance of six Feet, and one or two Inches {{on the other side of}} the Lens, and so form the Image of the coloured Paper upon a white Paper placed there, after the same manner that a Lens at a Hole in a Window casts the Images of Objects abroad upon a Sheet of white Paper in a dark Room. The aforesaid white Paper, erected perpendicular to the Horizon, and to the Rays which fell upon it from the Lens, I moved sometimes towards the Lens, sometimes from it, to find the Places where the Images of the blue and red Parts of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct. Those Places I easily knew by the Images of the black Lines which I had made by winding the Silk about the Paper. For the Images of those fine and slender Lines (which by reason of their Blackness were like Shadows on the Colours) were confused and scarce visible, unless when the Colours on either side of each Line were terminated most distinctly, Noting therefore, as diligently as I could, the Places where the Images of the red and blue halfs of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct, I found that where the red half of the Paper appeared distinct, the blue half appeared confused, so that the black Lines drawn upon it could scarce be seen; and on the contrary, where the blue half appeared most distinct, the red half appeared confused, so that the black Lines upon it were scarce visible. And between the two Places where these Images appeared distinct there was the distance of an Inch and a half; the distance of the white Paper from the Lens, when the Image of the red half of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct, being greater by an Inch and an half than the distance of the same white Paper from the Lens, when the Image of the blue half appeared most distinct. In like Incidences therefore of the blue and red upon the Lens, the blue was refracted more by the Lens than the red, so as to converge sooner by an Inch and a half, and therefore is more refrangible.|$|E

40|$|Goal of {{the project}} was to develop a 1 m-Telescope with normal {{incidence}} for spectroscopic research of hot cosmic light sources within the far and extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The telescope was equipped with two spectrometers: a highly resolving Echelle spectrometer and a modified Rowland spectrometer with medium resolution. The ORFEUS telescope and the Echelle spectrometer were designed by the IAA together with LSW, the instruments were constructed at the Kayser <b>Thred</b> Company in Germany. The modified Rowland spectrometer was designed and constructed at the SSL. ORFEUS was integrated at the retrievable Satellite ASTRO-SPAS. ASTRO-SPAS has a high precision pointing capability. ORFEUS was launched with the Space Shuttle DISCOVERY on Sept. 12, 1993. Spectra of 127 hot cosmic objects were measured during the free flying phase of about 125 hours. The mission was from a scientific point of view a full success. Technologically there occured some failures, finally the Echelle spectrometer failed to work. The measurements with this instrument could be replaced almost completely by measurements with the Berkeley spectrometer. The course of the mission, the reasons for the failures and first results are discussed. (orig.)
