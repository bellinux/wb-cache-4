500|$|His {{description}} {{of the river and}} the countryside betray the influence of the Post-Impressionist style. Hemingway was heavily influenced by the modernists. He often visited the Musée du Luxembourg, where he saw three Cézanne paintings, L'Estaque, Cour d'une ferme, and Les Peupliers. [...] A series of Cézanne watercolors were exhibited at Berheim-Jeune Gallery before he began writing the story. Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that he had been [...] "learning something from the painting of Cézanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put in them." ...|$|E

The scene they always cut out is the scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine's body and dances in the {{moonlight}} and on the beach with it. I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> write a song about dead things coming to life. I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and happy with it. It was about the dark side of love; about the ability to be resurrected by it... I just tried to put everything I could into it, and I'm real proud of it.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

500|$|Nimoy, in {{addition}} to his directing duties, appears {{towards the end of the}} film as Spock, but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found the most difficult scene to direct was one in which Leonard McCoy talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that not only was he in the scene, but his eyes are closed, making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: [...] "It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> direct him with the movement and flutter of my eyelids." [...] Nimoy was thankful the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes. The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis. Frank Welker provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.|$|E
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|On December 16, 1913, Shafer {{announced}} his retirement. He summed up {{his time with}} the Giants with: [...] "I have satisfied every ambition in a baseball way.

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{concluded}} Mrs. Easterfield, [...] "I can not ask you not {{to speak}} to anybody about what I have told you, but I do hope you will prevent its getting to Olive's ears.

60|$|My {{first thought}} was to fly back to my own chamber, but I {{abandoned}} it, feeling sure that I should be seen. Therefore I determined, if she discovered me, to face the matter out and say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find Leo, and to learn how he fared. So I crouched against the wall, and waited with a beating heart. I heard her sweep down the passage, and--yes--begin to mount the stair.|$|E

[...] "So {{long as we}} were rising at a stiff angle it was not noticeable, but now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to keep a horizontal course it is different.

6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] she said, [...] "of {{course you}} are. The papers have said so, Society has {{believed}} them.

6000|$|But I {{am afraid}} {{that this is a}} digression, and, of course, you know all about it just as well as I do.

Macdonald, and Pioneer Days in Tecumseh Township? ...|$|E
6000|$|He hesitated, {{glancing at}} her with troubled eyes, and then replied--"I thought, Miss Starbrow, that when you heard <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> live down the past--trying very hard and not unsuccessfully as I imagined--it would have made some {{difference}} in your feelings towards me. To win your forgiveness for the wrong I did you has been the one motive I have had for all my strivings since I last saw you. That has been the goal I have had before me--that only. Latterly I have hoped that Miss Eden, who had as much reason to regard me with enmity as yourself, would be my intercessor with you. By a most unhappy chance we have met too soon, and I regret it, I cannot say how much; for you make the task I have set myself seem so much harder than before that I almost despair." ...|$|E

60|$|But all {{the time}} I was taking the very keenest notice of {{everything}} which might possibly help me. I am not {{a man who would}} lie like a sick horse waiting for the farrier sergeant and the pole-axe. First I would give a little tug at my ankle cords, and then another at those which were round my wrists, and {{all the time}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> loosen them I was peering round to see if I could find something which was in my favour. There was one thing which was very evident. A hussar is but half formed without a horse, and there was my other half quietly grazing within thirty yards of me. Then I observed yet another thing. The path by which we had come over the mountains was so steep that a horse could only be led across it slowly and with difficulty, but in the other direction the ground appeared to be more open, and to lead straight down into a gently-sloping valley. Had I but my feet in yonder stirrups and my sabre in my hand, a single bold dash might take me out of the power of these vermin of the rocks.|$|E
60|$|About {{twenty-five years}} ago--along there somewhere--I {{suggested}} to Orion that he write an autobiography. I {{asked him to}} try to tell the straight truth in it; to refrain from exhibiting himself in creditable attitudes exclusively, and to honorably set down all the incidents of his life which he had found interesting to him, including those which were burned into his memory because he was ashamed of them. I said that this had never been done, and that if he could do it his autobiography would be a most valuable piece of literature. I said I was offering him a job which I could not duplicate in my own case, but I would cherish the hope that he might succeed with it. I recognise now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> saddle upon him an impossibility. I have been dictating this autobiography of mine daily for three months; I have thought of fifteen hundred or two thousand incidents in my life which I am ashamed of, but I have not gotten one of them to consent to go on paper yet. I think that that stock will still be complete and unimpaired when I finish these memoirs, if I ever finish them. I believe that if I should put in all or any of those incidents I should be sure to strike them out when I came to revise this book.|$|E

"That was {{the plan}} Cluny and I first thought of," [...] Marjory replied; [...] "but owing to the raids of the Douglas on the border, so strict a watch is kept on the walls {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} indeed to pass. Cluny has tried a dozen times each night, but the watch is so vigilant that he has each time failed to make his way past them, but has been challenged and has had several arrows discharged at him. The guard at the gates is extremely strict, and all carts that pass in and out are searched. Could you have tried to pass before your escape was known you might no doubt have done so in disguise, but the alarm will be given before the gates are open in the morning, and your chance of passing through undetected then would be small indeed. The death of the man Martin suggested a plan to me. I have proposed it to his wife, and she has fallen in with it. I have promised her a pension for her life should we succeed, but I believe she would have done it even without reward, for she is a true Scotchwoman. When she heard who it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> rescue, she said at once she would risk anything {{to save the life of}} one of Scotland's best and bravest champions; while, on the other hand, she cares not enough for her husband to offer any objection to my plans for the disposal of his body." ...|$|E
