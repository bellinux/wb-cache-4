5|$|British {{victories}} were swift, {{resulting in}} <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maratha Empire {{and the loss}} of Maratha independence. The Peshwa was defeated in the battles of Khadki and Koregaon. Several minor battles were fought by the Peshwa's forces to prevent his capture.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the family}} is so ancient and was so widely {{distributed}} on the Gondwana supercontinent, modern species commonly occur in relict populations isolated by geographical barriers, for instance on islands or tropical mountains. Relict forests retain endemic fauna and flora in communities of great value in inferring the palaeontological succession and climate change that followed <b>the</b> <b>breakups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supercontinents.|$|R
5|$|The album Adios {{was written}} and {{performed}} almost exclusively by Konietzko and Skold. Ogre again provided vocals, as did German musician Nina Hagen. Originally {{the fulfillment of}} the band's ten record contract with Wax Trax!/TVT, Adios later signaled <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band itself, which Esch's and Schulz's limited participation foreshadowed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carolingian Empire was {{accompanied}} by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles and settled there {{as well as in}} Iceland. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple (r. 898–922) to settle in what became Normandy. The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault until the invader's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. <b>The</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states, some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily, as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|From a {{conflicted}} {{and unhappy}} childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary output in publications such as The New Yorker {{and as a}} founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. Following <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics led to a place on the Hollywood blacklist.|$|E

5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, Russia {{inherited}} most of {{its military}} arsenal including its large complement of MRLs. In recent history, they {{have been used by}} Russian forces during the First and Second Chechen Wars and by Armenian and Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Georgian government forces are reported to have used BM-21 or similar rocket artillery in fighting in the 2008 South Ossetia war.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) {{and the creation of}} the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, <b>the</b> Federal Republic <b>of</b> Yugoslavia (FRY) was {{established}} in 1992 as a federation. In 2003, it was reconstituted as a political union called <b>the</b> State Union <b>of</b> Serbia and Montenegro (SCG).|$|R

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Get Up Kids, James Dewees toured with New Found Glory {{as their}} touring keyboardist, having been {{featured}} on their 2003 album Catalyst. While he was touring, his ongoing struggles {{with alcohol and}} drug abuse worsened. After moving to New York City, he began to attend rehab, a process which would inspire the fifth Reggie and the Full Effect album, Last Stop: Crappy Town. After another brief tour opening for Hellogoodbye in 2006, he joined My Chemical Romance as their full-time touring keyboardist.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{has seen}} some {{significant}} changes to its campaign {{over the course}} of its development. The Yuezhi faction, included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped. Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seleukid faction, if that collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In the paper, an {{engineering}} model for <b>the</b> im-pact <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space target is studied {{based on the}} thin plate. The average fragment size model for <b>the</b> impact <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin plate is established depending on the strain rate, according as Poisson statistic fragments are discrete and distribution model is figured out. On <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution analysis for the target and projectile, the target equivalent model based on the thin plate is established, and projectile equivalent model is also given. The length and velocity degraded model are set up against the cylindrical projectile. The simulation case is analyzed and the result indicates that the paper model is effective, flexible and has important engineering reference value...|$|R
25|$|With <b>the</b> {{formation}} <b>of</b> Lebanon and <b>the</b> 1948 <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrian-Lebanese customs union, Tripoli, once on par {{in economic}} and commercial importance to Beirut, {{was cut off}} from its traditional trade relations with the Syrian hinterland and therefore declined in relative prosperity.|$|R
50|$|Generation Tesla {{was started}} in 1995, by the {{publisher}} Luxor Strip. The comic represented one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest attempts to revive the comic scene in Serbia after <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia. <b>The</b> stories were written by Milan Konjević, penciled by Siniša Radović and inked by Zdravko Zupan.|$|R

5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and unemployment {{of many of the}} weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E
5|$|In southeastern Anatolia, the Ayyubids {{continued}} {{to rule the}} principality of Hisn Kayfa and managed to remain an autonomous entity, independent of the Mongol Ilkhanate, which ruled northern Mesopotamia until the 1330s. After <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ilkhanate, their former vassals in the area, the Artuqids, waged war against the Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa in 1334, but were decisively defeated, with the Ayyubids gaining the Artuqids' possessions on the left bank of the Tigris River. In the 14th century, the Ayyubids rebuilt the castle of Hisn Kayfa which served as their stronghold. The Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa were vassals of the Mamluks and later the Dulkadirids until being supplanted by the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Ochs was {{personally}} invited by John Lennon to sing {{at a large}} benefit at the University of Michigan in December 1971 on behalf of John Sinclair, an activist poet who had been arrested on minor drug charges and given a severe sentence. Ochs performed at the John Sinclair Freedom Rally along with Stevie Wonder, Allen Ginsberg, David Peel, Abbie Hoffman and many others. The rally culminated with Lennon and Yoko Ono, who were making their first public performance in the United States since <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Beatles.|$|E
5|$|On November 26, 1861, Governor Johnson {{issued an}} address to the {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth blaming abolitionists for <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. He asserted his belief that the Union and Confederacy were forces of equal strength, and that the only solution to the war was a free trade agreement between the two sovereign nations. He further announced his willingness to resign as provisional governor if the Kentucky General Assembly would agree to cooperate with Governor Magoffin. Magoffin himself denounced the Russellville Convention and the provisional government, stressing the need to abide by the will {{of the majority of the}} Commonwealth's citizens.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is {{the radiant}} of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, {{also known as}} the December Phoenicids, were first {{observed}} on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year. A very minor meteor shower peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower {{is referred to as the}} July Phoenicids.|$|E
