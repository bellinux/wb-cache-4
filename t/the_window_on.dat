5|$|Hurley (Jorge Garcia) is in {{a mental}} institution, where he is friends with Dave (Evan Handler), who tells Hurley to ignore the doctors, avoid his medication, and try to escape. One day, Hurley's doctor, Dr. Brooks (Bruce Davison), proves to Hurley that Dave is not real, by taking {{a photo of the}} two, and then showing Hurley that Dave is not in the picture. Later that night, Dave wakes Hurley up to escape with him from the institute. Dave hops out of a window, but Hurley confronts him and {{declares}} that Dave is not real, and shuts <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> him before going back to bed.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy first {{appears in}} EastEnders at Lucy Beale's (Melissa Suffield) party, where he gets {{pleasure}} from watching {{a fight between}} two girls, and asks other girls to play Twister with him but nobody will. In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project to encourage more young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>On</b> their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing they can no longer stay there, he invites ZsaZsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in Wanstead, but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 22 May, Anne Orderud Paust and her parents, Marie (b. 1915) and Kristian Orderud (b. 1918), were shot and killed in the parents' home, on the Olerud Estate in Sørum, Akershus. Hiding in the {{adjacent}} woods until the cover of nightfall, the assailant entered the house sometime between midnight and 5am by climbing on {{to the second floor}} porch and breaking <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the veranda door.|$|E

25|$|In the 2008–09 {{transfer}} window, Tottenham {{experienced a}} relatively quiet transition {{over the course}} of January. With the transfer window opening {{on the first day of}} the month, transfer speculation was mostly rebuffed by manager Harry Redknapp for the majority of the month, however Tottenham managed to secure the arrival of two players in <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>On</b> 28 January, experienced forward Eiður Guðjohnsen joined the club on loan from Monaco on a deal effective until the season's end. Two days later saw the return of another former player in Younès Kaboul, re-signed from Portsmouth for a fee believed to be around £5million in what was Tottenham's only permanent signing of the window.|$|E
25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of the leap was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E
25|$|Van Eyck {{used the}} {{technique}} of applying layer after layer of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world. Van Eyck {{took advantage of the}} longer drying time of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.|$|E

25|$|King Kong {{is often}} used in {{commercial}} culture, for example in advertisements for Coca-Cola and Energizer Batteries. A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life. A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) {{to get rid of}} the Energizer Bunny for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with biplanes flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling. In 1990 Kongfrontation became one of the original rides at Universal Studios Florida.|$|E
25|$|The men {{are well}} dressed, Graham smokes a pipe while wearing a fur-lined red velvet cape {{and a red}} velvet cap which is {{slightly}} askew. The grey coat he wears with a white neckerchief is opened at the chest, revealing a gold-brocade waistcoat, his lower half is clothed in breeches, stockings and slippers. The chaplain wears a black coat with a white collar, grey stockings and black shoes with gold buckles, the costume of a social inferior to Graham, but indicating his educated status. The clerk's dress is similarly simple, a brown jacket, bluish-green waistcoat and white collar, while the steward wears a white apron, smock and cap with a black collar, and brown trousers. The black servant's dress is richer, a white cap and pink neckerchief, and a green buttoned velvet coat with a yellow waistcoat. Trump wears Graham's wig. The colours of the painting are mostly of cool greys, blues and reds, with the brown {{of some of the}} clothes and the wooden pilaster panelling, and the lighter blue through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the left of the painting.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> {{the north}} side of the church has a trefoil pattern at the top, and the hoodmould is {{decorated}} with faces. The south side of the building has a number of arched windows, singularly or in pairs, also with hoodmoulds.

5000|$|The {{tops and}} bottoms of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second {{building}} have different vanishing points.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floors}} of the {{building}} contain seven windows that are evenly distributed. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> are all rectangular in shape, but each is topped with a curved cornice. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third floor are taller than {{the ones on the}} second, which gives the building a vertical orientation. At one time <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third floor were stained glass and depicted symbols of <b>the</b> I.O.O.F. These <b>windows</b> have been removed.|$|R
500|$|Most of the [...] high {{stained glass}} windows have {{abstract}} designs. Those in front feature crests of Apostolic Nuncios John Cardinal Burkowski and Francesco Cardinal Colasuonno. The windows in the transept are slightly larger and have a more complex design. The window in the right lateral arm depicts Saint Peter and Saint Andrew, who symbolise the Western and Eastern branches of the Catholic Church. On <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> {{the opposite side of}} the left lateral arm is depicted Pope John PaulII, who is gazing at the Marian apparition of Fátima. In the nave, under the windows, are fourteen reliefs depicting the Stations of the Cross.|$|E
500|$|The nave has two windows. [...] The south window, to {{the east}} of the vestry, is from the 14th century. [...] It has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by mullions) with flat tops and is decorated with stone tracery. A survey of the church in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted the window’s [...] "crude workmanship and design." [...] <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the north nave wall has three lights with rounded tops. It too has been dated to the 14th century, but other sources say that it is from the 16th century. [...] A 2009 guide to buildings of north-west Wales says that the window is [...] "typically 16th-century".|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} work-in, the {{remainder}} of the stone floor was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak [...] long by [...] diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar.|$|E

500|$|Homeless, Apu {{moves into}} the {{apartment}} complex where Kirk Van Houten lives. The octuplets then speak their first words, which put together, say [...] "Mommy, will you let daddy come back...cookie!" [...] Marge and Manjula go to Apu's and arrive in time {{to prevent him from}} committing suicide by hanging. Apu is then subjected to several tasks to redeem himself (such as eating a light bulb), though Manjula says it will take time for everything to get back to normal. In bed, Manjula, finally satisfied with what he has done, kisses Apu while Homer watches from <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>on</b> a ladder. The couple continues and Homer, traumatized, hops backwards on the ladder all the way home, without falling, mimicking what he did earlier.|$|E
500|$|The keep {{today is}} 46feet (14m) high and is {{modelled}} on early 13th-century English round towers {{built in the}} south of the Welsh Marches. As with other Welsh-constructed towers, the entrance is on the first storey, not at ground level; it may originally have been protected by a porch. The keep had a portcullis which would have been drawn up past <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the second storey of the tower. While the castle's flooring has long since disappeared, its interior staircase to the upper storey may still be climbed. This second storey would have formed the main chamber in the keep and had a large fireplace and a latrine. Originally the keep would have had a parapet and battlements, since destroyed. Historian Richard Avent considers it [...] "the finest surviving example of a Welsh round tower".|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> {{the north}} {{wall of the}} nave is {{to the east of}} the door, and was added in the 19th century. It has two rounded lights (sections of window {{separated}} by mullions), in similar style to the two-light 17th-century window in the north wall of the north transept. [...] The second window in the transept, in the east wall, is from the 19th century. The two windows in the south transept, in the south and east walls, are both from the 17th century, and are square-headed with two lights. The window in the east wall of the chancel is from the 19th-century and has three lights topped with stonework trefoils. It has an external hoodmould (a decorative stone border) around the top. The glass of all the windows is patterned, and some is coloured; the coloured glass is used {{in the same way as}} in other Anglesey churches whose 19th-century restorations were aided by Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley, an Anglesey nobleman who converted to Islam.|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} façade has rustication on {{the ground}} floor and rich stucco decorations on the upper floors. The keystones of the rounded openings are designed as grotesque masques. Other decorations include dolphins below <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor and shields crowned by hives and held by mermaids above <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor and eagles above <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second floor. The iron balconies on the rounded corner of the first and second floor are supported by flying eagles. Below the rain gutters is a frieze featuring putti holding a garland. A falling putto is seen in the bay furthest to the east. The figure was made to commemorate a worker who fell to his death under the construction of the building.|$|R
50|$|The Church of St Barrahane, {{built in}} 1826, overlooks the town. Its main {{architect}} was James Pain. This replaced the original church built in 1761. It is {{noted for its}} stained glass windows; <b>the</b> east <b>window</b> by Harry Clarke, {{was given to the}} church in 1915 in memory of Mr and Mrs Somerville by their grandchildren. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> in <b>the</b> south wall of the chancel and <b>the</b> third <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side are also by Clarke. <b>The</b> eastern <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side, <b>the</b> eastern-most <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side and <b>the</b> second <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side are all by Powell's of London.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each floor are of {{different}} designs, all equally ornate. The largest, {{those on the}} first floor, are {{in the form of}} a trefoil, which was the emblem of the Tresham family. <b>The</b> basement <b>windows</b> are small trefoils with a triangular pane at their centre. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor are of a lozenge design, each having 12 small circular openings surrounding a central cruciform slit. Heraldic shields of various families surround these windows.|$|R
500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty {{in the back of his}} neck as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E
