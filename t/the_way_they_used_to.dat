500|$|A 2007 Vogue {{profile of}} Grant {{referred}} {{to him as a}} man with a [...] "professionally misanthropic mystique". Grant has expressed distaste for focus groups, market research, and emphasis on opening weekend box-office numbers, saying: [...] "It's so destructive to the filmmaking process. What was wrong with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> release films, more slowly, let them build?" [...] The director Mike Newell has said: [...] "There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy." [...] Filmmaker Paul Weitz said that Grant is funny and that [...] "he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless."

2500|$|Philpot made further {{controversial}} comments {{after the}} 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, legalizing gay marriage throughout the United States. Philpot described gay marriage as an oxymoron, the Supreme Court's decision as [...] "pretty close to insane," [...] and described homosexual relationships as [...] "sterile" [...] and [...] "just entertainment." [...] He also described homosexuality as a choice, saying that children now have [...] "got {{to decide which}} gender to date"; this matches his previously expressed views that the gay lifestyle is a [...] "destructive lifestyle" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "behavior, it's not genetic." [...] LGBT rights advocates challenged these views as showing a [...] "fundamental misunderstanding {{of what it means to}} be LGBT" [...] and as evidence of a [...] "deep disrespect for LGBT people and their families." [...] Judges have a First Amendment right to express their views so long as they do not influence their decisions. Philpot has presided over many cases with LGBT people and lawyers who have been involved report that he does not base his decisions on a litigant's sexuality. Speaking of his religious views, Philpot has stated that [...] "I don't mention Jesus inside the courthouse very much, even when I know he is absolutely the only answer to the problem in front of me." [...] Philpot has also stated that [...] "half the adoptions I do are for gay people. And they're not bad people," [...] and that he loves homosexuals. Philpot regrets, however, that friendships between straight men are affected as they are unable to hug in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> and that the rainbow, a symbol from the Bible, had been [...] "stolen" [...] – and he plans to put a rainbow on the back of his car.|$|E

That’s why I do most things. How do you get over?” he sighed.|$|E

I {{did not even}} look towards the ship; I did not care; indeed, I think I must have gone to sleep, because {{all of a sudden}} there were shouts and I found the ship almost on top of me. They hauled me on board and secured the boat astern. They were all blacks, except the captain, who was a mulatto. He alone knew a few words of French. I could not find out where they were going nor who they were. They gave me {{something}} to eat every day; but I did not like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> discuss me in their language. Perhaps they were deliberating about throwing me overboard in order to keep possession of the boat. How do I know? As we were passing this island I asked whether it was inhabited. I understood from the mulatto that there was a house on it. A farm, I fancied, they meant. So I asked them to put me ashore on the beach and keep the boat for their trouble. This, I imagine, was just what they wanted. The rest you know." ...|$|E

60|$|Maybe {{the boys}} {{nowadays}} do not throw fire-balls, or know about them. They {{were made of}} cotton rags wound tight and sewed, and then soaked in turpentine. When a ball was lighted a boy caught it quickly up, and threw it, and it made a splendid streaming blaze through the air, and a thrilling whir as it flew. A boy {{had to be very}} nimble not to get burned, and a great many boys dropped the ball for every boy that threw it. I am not ready to say why these fire-balls did not set the Boy's Town on fire, and burn it down, but I know they never did. There was no law against them, and the boys were never disturbed in throwing them, any more than they were in building bonfires; and this shows, as much as anything, what a glorious town that was for boys. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> build their bonfires was to set one tar-barrel on top of another, as high as the biggest boy could reach, and then drop a match into them; in a moment a dusky, smoky flame would burst from the top, and fly there like a crimson flag, while all the boys leaped and danced round it, and hurrahed for the Whig candidates. Sometimes they would tumble the blazing barrels over, and roll them up and down the street.|$|E

It's the daintiest outfit that ever was--you will say so, when you see it. She's lovely in it--oh, just a dream! In some ways she is just her age, but in others she's as old as her uncle, I think. She is very learned. She teaches her uncle his book. I have seen her sitting by with the book and reciting to him what is in it, so that he can learn to do it himself.|$|E
