He {{was selected to}} do cardiovascular research at the University of Washington over the summer before his senior year. During that year, he received the top score of 5 on every Advanced Placement exam he took, and was chosen as class valedictorian in 1996. Shortly after graduation Robert and three of his classmates were one of three high school winners of the ExploraVision national scientific contest, earning <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> a trip to Washington, D.C. The topic of their project was the future of nanotechnology.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.|$|E
25|$|Having {{failed to}} rally an army to retake Ambohimanga, in 1787 Andrianjafy was {{approached}} by messengers who claimed they regretted their betrayal and wished to reinstate him as king. The messengers carried him on a royal palanquin to their village in the north, using a circuitous route that disoriented him. He realized too late that the porters had taken him deep into Andrianampoinimerina's territory; they bound him with rope and brought him to his nephew. Andrianampoinimerina was prepared to let his uncle go free after submitting, but the people of Ambohimanga desired vengeance for the violence and injustices the fallen king had inflicted upon <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Andrianampoinimerina took a walk to distract himself while his followers carried Andrianjafy to a nearby location where he was put to death.|$|E

The Force has suffered heavily in protecting {{both sides of the}} community from danger â€“ 302 officers {{have been killed in the}} line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously.

25|$|In Augustus' {{capacity}} as supreme {{head of the}} public road system, he converted the temporary cura {{of each of the}} great roads into a permanent magistracy. The persons appointed under the new system were of senatorial or equestrian rank, according to the relative importance of the roads respectively assigned to them. It was the duty of each curator to issue contracts for the maintenance and repairs of his road, and to see that the contractor who undertook the work performed it faithfully, as to both quantity and quality. Moreover, he authorized the construction of sewers and removed obstructions to traffic, as the aediles did in Rome. It was in the character of an imperial curator, though probably of one armed with extraordinary powers, that Corbulo (as has been already mentioned) denounced the magistratus and mancipes of the Italian roads to Tiberius. He pursued <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> with fines and imprisonment for 18 years (AD 21-39), and was rewarded with a consulship by Caligula, who was himself in the habit of condemning well-born citizens to work on the roads. It is noticeable that Claudius brought Corbulo to justice, and repaid the money which had been extorted from his victims.|$|E
25|$|Sex Trafficking/San Antonio: On June 1, 2007, a San Antonio {{woman and}} her two daughters were ordered {{detained}} without bond for engaging in sex trafficking of children. The woman, age 59, and her daughters, ages 32 and 29, were {{arrested and charged with}} sex trafficking of children by force, fraud or coercion. Based on the ongoing investigation and the victimsâ€™ statements, it is alleged that the defendants traveled to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, to recruit young girls to work as prostitutes in the San Antonio area. The victims in this case were 15, 17, and 22 years old. After arriving in the United States, the victims were told they would have to work as prostitutes for five years to repay the money the defendants had spent. Allegedly the money was spent on smuggling and other expenses they incurred to prepare the young women to be prostitutes. The victims told ICE agents that they were scared to leave because a male associate of the Ochoaâ€™s had threatened them with a gun; he also stated that he could find <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> back in Mexico, and he would have them killed. The female violators in this case received sentences of time served to 18 months in prison for their convictions for harboring and transporting aliens for financial gain. One of the male defendants was sentenced to 120 months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for financial gain and for aiding and abetting sex trafficking of a child. One remaining defendant is scheduled for jury trial in February 2009.|$|E

500|$|After the {{occupation}} of Poland, the Nazi German administration created hundreds of ghettos, with ethnic Poles on the [...] "Aryan side" [...] and the Polish Jews on the [...] "Jewish side" [...] of metropolitan cities and towns. Anyone from the Aryan side caught assisting those on the Jewish side in obtaining food was subject to the death penalty. Capital punishment and collective responsibility of entire families for aiding Jews, was the most draconian such Nazi practice against any nation in occupied Europe. On 10 November 1941, {{the death penalty was}} expanded by Hans Frank to apply to Poles who helped Jews [...] "in any way: by taking them in for the night, giving them a lift in a vehicle of any kind" [...] or [...] "feed runaway Jews or sell them foodstuffs". The law was made public by posters distributed in all major cities. Polish rescuers were fully conscious of the dangers facing <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> not only from the Germans, but also from betrayers (see:szmalcownik) within the local population. The Nazis implemented a law forbidding all non-Jews from buying from Jewish shops under the maximum penalty of death.|$|E
500|$|At {{the top of}} {{the incline}} the line ran along the Brendon ridge in both directions, eastward to Raleigh's Cross and westward to a {{heathland}} terminus named after the nearby village of Gupworthy. Considerable numbers of miners lived in these remote areas. For some time the Company had permitted <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> to travel on the line free of charge and at their own risk. It was decided to operate a formal passenger service between Comberow and Watchet, which started with great celebration on 4 September 1865. In the full year 1866 13,000 passengers were carried; by 1872 this had risen to 19,000 and peaked at 19,680 in 1874. Four passenger trains ran each way daily at first, but this was later reduced to two, and then to one. Passenger trains took half an hour to travel from Comberow to Watchet.

He also held talks with other far-right European parties, such as Vlaams Belang and Jobbik. The BNP maintains ties with Roberto Fiore and fascist groups across Europe. Griffin criticised Gordon Brown's Labour government for its attitude toward the BNP, accusing it of treating elected representatives of the BNP as [...] "second-class citizens". Following {{his election}}, {{in a press conference}} held at a public house in Manchester, he criticised the privatisation of national industries, such as the railway network, and accused MPs generally of being involved in this [...] "...giant looting of Britain".

He was {{declared}} an adult in 1524, but the next year Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, the young king's stepfather, took custody of James and held him as a virtual prisoner for three years, exercising power on his behalf. He finally managed to escape from the custody of the regents in 1528 and began to take revenge on a number of <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> He continued his father's policy of subduing the rebellious Highlands, Western and Northern isles and the troublesome borders. He took punitive measures against the Clan Douglas in the north, summarily executed John Armstrong of Liddesdale and carried out royal progresses to underline his authority. He also continued the French Auld alliance that had been in place since the fourteenth century, marrying first the French noblewoman Madeleine of Valois and then after her death Marie of Guise. He increased crown revenues by heavily taxing the church, taking Â£72,000 in four years, and embarked on a major programme of building at royal palaces. He avoided pursuing the major structural and theological changes to the church undertaken by his contemporary Henry VIII in England. He used the Church as a source of offices for his many illegitimate children and his favourites, particularly David Beaton, who became Archbishop of Saint Andrews and a Cardinal. James V's domestic and foreign policy successes were overshadowed by another disastrous campaign against England that led to an overwhelming defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss (1542). James died a short time later, a demise blamed by contemporaries on [...] "a broken heart". The day before his death, he was brought news of the birth of an heir: a daughter, who would become Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
