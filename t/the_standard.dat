The findings demonstrate that awareness and knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> is high given the early stage of implementation. Other key findings outlined in the report include: •Broad awareness and understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> {{as demonstrated by the}} wide range of activities reported in The Forum •An average of 70 % of stakeholders reported knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> •An average of 61 % of teachers, school leaders and teacher educators who completed the Survey reported use of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> in their practice •Self-reflection and discussion with colleagues are the most commonly reported use of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> from survey respondents •An average of 74 % of survey respondents reported opportunity to use <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> and an average of 78 % intend to use <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> in <b>the</b> next six months.  The interim report concludes that while there is evidence of implementation activity across Australia, continuing focus on, and resourcing of, the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> is required to support stakeholders to increase their implementation activity and embed <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> within their daily practice.  ...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{standards}} of ethics proclaim the core {{values of a}} profession, describe expected professional duties and responsibilities, and {{provide a framework for}} ethical practice and ethical decision-making. The purpose of this mixed, quantitative and qualitative, survey study was to examine HRD professionals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about <b>the</b> AHRD <b>Standards</b> on Ethics and Integrity, how HRD professionals used <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> for research and decision-making, {{and the extent to which}} <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> provided guidance for ethical decision-making. Through an on-line survey instrument, 182 members of AHRD were surveyed. The open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis to expand on, inform, and support the quantitative findings. The close-ended questions were analyzed with frequency distributions, descriptive statistics, cross tabulations, and Spearman rank correlations. ^ The results showed a significant relationship between (a) years of AHRD membership and level of familiarity with <b>the</b> <b>Standards,</b> (b) years of AHRD membership and use of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> for research, and (c) level of familiarity with <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> and use of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> for research.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{the plan for}} establishing <b>the</b> SISO <b>Standards</b> Landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Standards</b> Landscape {{is to establish a}} framework that articulates <b>the</b> M&S <b>standards</b> that currently exist, relationships among <b>the</b> <b>standards,</b> user guidance on which standards best apply to different situations, where users can obtain <b>the</b> <b>standards,</b> and identifies areas where standards are needed but do not exist. The challenge is to develop an inter-view of standards that illustrates integrated standards within a meaningful framework of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> Landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Standards</b> Landscape portrays how standards work together to contribute to the interoperability and reuse to that enables organizations to achieve their return on investment (ROI) by increasing quality and productivity while reducing schedule and cost. This paper {{presents the}} plan to do just that. Further this paper describes how to apply quality attributes of <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> Landscape to help communicate, through example, the need for a compelling and integrated view of standards. 1...|$|R
