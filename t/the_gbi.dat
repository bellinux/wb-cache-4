40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{validate}} manic and depressive scales carved from the full-length General Behavior Inventory (<b>GBI).</b> <b>The</b> brief version was designed to be applicable for youths and adults and to improve separation between mania and depression dimensions. Data came from 9 studies (2 youth clinical samples, aggregate N = 738, and 7 nonclinical adult samples, aggregate N = 1, 756). Items with high factor loadings on the 2 extracted dimensions of mania and depression were identified from both data sets, and final item selection was based on internal reliability criteria. Confirmatory factor analyses described the 2 -factor model's fit. Criterion validity was compared between mania and depression scales, and with <b>the</b> full-length <b>GBI</b> scales. For both mania and depression factors, 7 items produced a psychometrically adequate measure applicable across both aggregate samples. Internal reliability of the Mania scale was. 81 (youth) and. 83 (adult) and for Depression was. 93 (youth) and. 95 (adult). By design, the brief scales were less strongly correlated with each other than were <b>the</b> original <b>GBI</b> scales. Construct validity of the new instrument was supported in observed discriminant and convergent relationships with external correlates and discrimination of diagnostic groups. <b>The</b> new brief <b>GBI,</b> <b>the</b> 7 Up 7 Down Inventory, demonstrates sound psychometric properties across a wide age range, showing expected relationships with external correlates.
