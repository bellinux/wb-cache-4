5|$|Some frogs such as Bokermannohyla alvarengai, which basks in sunlight, lighten <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> colour when hot (and darkens when cold), making <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> reflect {{more heat}} and so avoid overheating.|$|E

5|$|Many {{animals have}} dark {{pigments}} such as melanin in <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> eyes and fur {{to protect themselves}} against sunburn (damage to living tissues caused by ultraviolet light).|$|E
60|$|They {{ventured out}} into the darkness, feeling the soft air of night upon <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b>|$|R

50|$|The tanner: A minor antagonist, {{he kills}} animals to make leather from <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> {{to sell or}} barter in his shop.|$|R
5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through the top of <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> This is unusual for reptiles, because <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|South American poison dart frogs in {{the genus}} Dendrobates feed mainly on ants, and the toxins in <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> {{may come from}} the ants.|$|E
5|$|They feed {{on small}} fish and {{occasionally}} young octopodes. They are {{often associated with}} the sea snake barnacle (Platylepas ophiophila) which attaches to <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Slow Walkers: Described as a Maasai-like ethnicity, but {{taller and}} implied to shed <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> periodically. Peacetime {{allies of the}} People.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. Who's at {{the bottom}} of this, Timothy? Rench? Hillman? I thought so. Well, they're not bad chaps when you get under <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b>|$|R
60|$|Each one had two heads, eight feet, {{and four}} rows of teeth, and <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> were {{as hard as}} turtle shells, and were bright red.|$|R
5|$|A few {{species are}} able to use {{chemical}} defences against predators; some Procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor, and some species of pitohuis from New Guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> and feathers.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus actively change <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> patterns and colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for signalling. However, Smith's dwarf chameleon does use active colour change for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin {{at the top of the}} head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).|$|E
5000|$|... "Large scale exploitation" [...] of {{monitor lizards}} is {{undertaken}} for <b>their</b> <b>skins,</b> which {{are described as}} being [...] "of considerable utility" [...] in the leather industry.|$|R
5000|$|The Rassam Cylinder, in the British Museum {{demonstrates}} this. Their corpses {{they hung}} on stakes, they stripped off <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> {{and covered the}} city wall with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "We tried {{stuffing}} ours with hay once," [...] remarked the Captain; [...] "but it made <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> look lumpy, {{it was so}} coarse; so now we use cotton altogether." ...|$|R
5|$|The toxic {{properties}} of parsnip extracts {{are resistant to}} heating, or a storage period of several months. Toxic symptoms can also affect livestock and poultry in parts of their bodies where <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> is exposed. Polyynes {{can be found in}} Apiaceae vegetables such as parsnip, and they show cytotoxic activities.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic, {{tetrapod}} vertebrates of {{the class}} Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit {{a wide variety of}} habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.|$|E
5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E
25|$|Larvae develop {{through four}} stages, or instars, {{after which they}} {{metamorphose}} into pupae. At {{the end of each}} instar, the larvae molt, shedding <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> to allow for further growth.|$|R
60|$|Constant {{confinement}} {{below ground}} had wrought odd freaks upon <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b> They more resemble corpses than living beings. Many are deformed, others maimed, while the majority, Thuvia explained, are sightless.|$|R
5000|$|T"... <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> Will {{bear witness}} against them, As to (all) their deeds." [...] (41:20) {{has been said}} to be {{confirmed}} {{by the development of}} using fingerprints for identification of criminals.|$|R
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E
5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% {{of the animal}} protein eaten by the world's human population {{in the form of}} meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known lungless tetrapods are amphibians. The majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders, which respirate through <b>their</b> <b>skin</b> and tissues lining their mouth. This necessarily restrict their size: all are small and rather thread-like in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. Other known lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti, a caecilian.|$|E
5|$|In {{the areas}} in which it was endemic, the emu was an {{important}} source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into <b>their</b> <b>skin.</b> It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of <b>their</b> <b>skin,</b> then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E
6000|$|... "To govern men, {{there is}} but one way, and it is eternal truth. Get [...] into <b>their</b> <b>skins.</b> Try to realize their feelings. That is the true [...] secret of government." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P'r'aps <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> ain't as tender as what mine is," [...] urged Mr. Jobson; [...] "and besides, fancy me in a top-'at! Why, I {{shall be}} the laughing-stock of the place." ...|$|R
25|$|The initial {{winemaking}} {{steps of}} Madeira start out {{like most other}} wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines â€“ Bual and Malvasia â€“ are often fermented on <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> to leach more phenols from the grapes to balance {{the sweetness of the}} wine. The more dry wines â€“ made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole â€“ are separated from <b>their</b> <b>skins</b> prior to fermentation. Depending on the level of sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral grape spirits.|$|R
