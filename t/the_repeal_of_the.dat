5|$|<b>The</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws was {{met with}} resentment and {{violence}} in Vincennes. An effigy of Jesse Bright was burnt in the street, and Rice Jones, a popular abolitionist, was murdered.|$|E
5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's request for <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; {{a horde of}} dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of}} the populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E

50|$|Bikalpa Dhara opposed <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thirteenth Amendment that {{abolished}} the caretaker government system in Bangladesh, and stated their liking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{system to the}} Chief Election Commissioner during a formal dialogue. The party also has agreed to join former foe BNP in a movement to reinstate the caretaker government.|$|R
5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings supported <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted the}} rights of Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing {{that they were being}} treated as second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|Ryan opposes {{same-sex}} marriage, {{had previously}} supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against {{a bill that}} would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Board of Trade, William Gladstone, {{resigned}} from the cabinet over the Maynooth Grant. The Corn Laws imposed a tariff on imported wheat, protecting British farmers from foreign competition, but making the cost of bread artificially high. Peel hoped that <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws and the resultant influx of cheaper wheat into Britain would relieve {{the condition of the}} poor, and in particular the suffering caused by successive failure of potato crops in Ireland—the Great Famine.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1659 Elizabeth Lilburne petitioned Richard Cromwell for <b>the</b> {{discharge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fine {{imposed on}} her husband by <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> 30 Jan. 1652, and her request was granted. Parliament on a similar petition recommended <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act, and the recommendation was carried by the restored Long Parliament on 15 August 1659.|$|R
50|$|Ayotte favors <b>the</b> {{permanent}} <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{estate tax}} and has co-sponsored legislation to <b>repeal</b> <b>the</b> tax.|$|R
2500|$|PNŢ-CD {{strongly}} opposed <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article. Its leader, Corneliu Coposu, argued that its Christian stance led it [...] "to combat every deviation from <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> nature and from <b>the</b> moral principles <b>of</b> a future balanced society", while deputy Emil Popescu said that [...] "incest was preferable to homosexuality {{since at least}} the former preserved <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> procreation".|$|R
5|$|The {{inaugural meeting}} of the Women's Franchise League (WFL) was held on 25 July 1889, at the Pankhurst home in Russell Square. William Lloyd Garrison spoke at the meeting, warning the {{audience}} that the US abolition movement had been hampered by individuals advocating moderation and patience. Early members of the WFL included Josephine Butler, leader of the Ladies National Association for <b>the</b> <b>Repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Contagious Diseases Acts; the Pankhursts' friend Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy; and Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch, daughter of US suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Garrow {{also became}} {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws, voting for the measure, and sponsored legislation to control surgical practice in the United Kingdom; the bill did not, however, pass into law. In the early 19th century animal cruelty was widespread; Garrow {{was one of those}} who found it appalling, and sponsored a bill in 1816 to increase the penalties for riding horses until their severe injury or death. While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by Thomas Erskine, which was given the Royal Assent and came into law. Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer.|$|E

The organization was dedicated to ending discrimination and harassment {{of gay and lesbian}} U.S. military personnel. [...] Lady Gaga received the Randy Shilts Visibility Award in 2011, for raising the [...] "Don't Ask, Don’t Tell" [...] campaign to the public and for actively supporting <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law in 2010.|$|R

5|$|In {{his address}} to the state {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks. He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person {{on the board of}} trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only white person included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Northern England, as {{the first}} area {{in the world to}} industrialise, was the birthplace of much modern {{political}} thought. Reports into the lives of the Northern working class, from Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England to George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier, shaped Marxism and, more generally, socialism. Meanwhile, enterprise and trade at the North's ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a laissez-faire free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian, the movement's greatest success was <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{successfully}} steered <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws through Parliament, and {{was then}} defeated by {{an alliance of}} all his enemies {{on the issue of}} Irish law and order; he resigned in June 1846. The Tories remained split and the Queen sent for Lord John Russell, the Whig leader. In the 1847 general election, Disraeli stood, successfully, for the Buckinghamshire constituency. The new House of Commons had more Conservative than Whig members, but the depth of the Tory schism enabled Russell to continue to govern. The Conservatives were led by Bentinck in the Commons and Stanley in the Lords.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>the</b> {{financial}} crisis <b>of</b> 2007–2008, some commentators argued that <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> Sections 20 and 32 had {{played an important}} role in leading to the housing bubble and {{financial crisis}}. Economics Nobel prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, for instance, argued that [...] "hen <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> Glass-Steagall brought investment and commercial banks together, the investment-bank culture came out on top", and banks which had previously been managed conservatively turned to riskier investments to increase their returns. Another laureate, Paul Krugman, contended that <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act [...] "was indeed a mistake"; however, it was not <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial crisis.|$|R
2500|$|Financial reform, led by William Huskisson and Peel, rationalized the tariff system, and {{culminated in}} <b>the</b> great <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tariffs on {{imported}} grain in 1846, much to <b>the</b> dismay <b>of</b> grain farmers. <b>The</b> 1846 <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Law [...] established free trade {{as the basic}} principle by which British merchants came to dominate the globe, and brought cheap food to British workers. A depoliticize civil service based on merit replaced patronage policies rewarding jobs for partisan efforts. [...] Efficiency was a high priority in government, with <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> low taxation. [...] Overall, taxation was about 10%, the lowest in any modern nation.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{supports}} <b>the</b> permanent <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) and cosponsored <b>the</b> SGR <b>Repeal</b> and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015) {{which would}} have <b>repealed</b> <b>the</b> SGR and improved the physician payment system to reward value over volume.|$|R
5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long {{remained silent}} on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{bimetallism}} {{grew in the}} 1870s, {{and resulted}} in {{the passage of the}} Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase {{millions of dollars worth of}} silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silver purchase act.|$|E
5|$|The coffeehouse {{became a}} popular place to debate ideas, with growing {{literacy}} {{and the development}} of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially a large Jewish community, and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} at the 1832 general {{election}} as a Member of Parliament (MP) for <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> London, but resigned his seat on 12 August 1833 {{by taking the}} Chiltern Hundreds. During his parliamentary career he supported <b>the</b> abolition <b>of</b> slavery, <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assessed taxes, abrogation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws, <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> triennial parliaments and the vote by ballot.|$|R

25|$|In January 1947, Government of Bombay {{set up a}} committee, which {{included}} B.G. Kher, then Chief Minister Morarji Desai, and Gulzarilal Nanda, to look into <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> 'criminal tribes'. This set into motion <b>the</b> final <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act in August 1949, which resulted in 2,300,000 tribals being decriminalised.|$|R
5|$|While the Lowlands {{had seen}} {{widespread}} agricultural improvement, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned {{nearly half the}} land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. They turned to money rents and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving office}} in 1989, the Reagans {{purchased}} {{a home in}} Bel Air, Los Angeles, {{in addition to the}} Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara. They regularly attended Bel Air Church and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the Republican Party; Reagan delivered a well-received speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention. Previously on November 4, 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was dedicated and opened to the public. At the dedication ceremonies, five presidents were in attendance, as well as six first ladies, marking the first time that five presidents were gathered in the same location. Reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of a line-item veto; the Brady Bill; a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget; and <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 22nd Amendment, which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president. In 1992 Reagan established the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award with the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. His final public speech was on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C., and his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994.|$|E
5|$|Boston, {{the capital}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an {{important}} shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s. In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, by which a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to the colonies were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in the colonies. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent {{what became known as the}} Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement, and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.|$|E
50|$|He became Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1703 {{and then}} Lord Chief Justice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's Bench from 1711-14, after being {{dismissed}} in 1707 for {{his opposition to}} <b>the</b> possible <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacramental test for religious dissenters in that year. He escaped impeachment when Ormonde defected to the Jacobite cause in 1715.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a member}} from Suffolk County <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York State Assembly from 1777 to 1785. During his last term, he was Speaker. As speaker, he took {{a leading role in}} {{reconciling}} the differences between Tory and Whig factions. He oversaw <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> laws that had imposed civil and legal penalties on Tories.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> Prohibition, <b>the</b> federal {{government}} allowed each state to regulate its own production and sale <b>of</b> alcohol. For <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> states {{this led to}} <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a three-tier distribution system between the producer, wholesaler and consumer. Depending on the state there are some exceptions, with wineries allowed to sell directly to consumers on site at the winery.|$|R
