5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that <b>the</b> <b>replacement</b> of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than <b>the</b> <b>replacement</b> of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
