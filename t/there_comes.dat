5|$|The first {{theory is}} that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an {{unspecified}} reason, and that the Greeks moved {{to take advantage of this}} by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the Suda dictionary. The entry χωρίς ἰππεῖς ("without cavalry") is explained thus: The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when Miltiades realized that, he attacked and thus won. From <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle. There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon. This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army began to re-embark, intending to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred before the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).|$|E
25|$|The {{elements}} {{found in}} consciousness are {{also to be}} found in the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection. This was afterwards modified, expanded and more fully expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First, in the spontaneous stage, where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect, humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage, mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite. Thirdly, <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite, Greece the finite or reflective epoch, the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics we have a correspondence also with the ideas of monarchy, democracy, and constitutional polity.|$|E

500|$|In autumn 1928, {{an early}} frost reduced farm incomes by between ten and 25 percent. [...] Farmers began {{to demand the}} {{extension}} of the Debt Adjustment Act over the entire province, along with more radical measures. [...] Citing the example of R. W. Barritt, a farmer near Mirror who had lost his farm at the end of 1928 to Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation despite diligent efforts to pay off his debt, they demanded legislation that would spread the burden of failed crops between debtor and creditor, rather than leaving it all on farmers. [...] Brownlee rejected such calls: [...] "Unless we are to say that individuals or companies who lend money in this Province in good faith must wait indefinitely for repayment, whatever may be the contract or agreement at the time, <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> a limit {{to the extent to which}} the Government is justified in interfering".|$|E

He claimed that UDI did not mark [...] "a diminution in the opportunities which our African people have to advance and prosper in Rhodesia", described [...] "racial harmony in Africa" [...] as part of his agenda and condemned black nationalist activities as attempts to [...] "blackmail the British government into... handing the country over to irresponsible rule". He then attempted to assuage fears that economic sanctions might destroy the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: [...] "The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders... In the lives of most nations <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> a moment when a stand has to be made for principles, whatever the consequences. This moment has come to Rhodesia... the first Western nation {{in the last two decades}} to say 'so far and no further'." [...] He concluded with an assertion that the declaration of independence was [...] "a blow for the preservation of justice, civilisation and Christianity".|$|E

500|$|Moore is {{particularly}} known for playing troubled women, and specializes in [...] "ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions". Oliver Burkeman of The Guardian writes that her characters are typically [...] "struggling {{to maintain a}} purchase on normality {{in the face of}} some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure". Suzie Mackenzie, also of The Guardian, has identified a theme of [...] "characters in a state of alienation... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question." [...] Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> a point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a [...] "trademark moment" [...] in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the [...] "queen of the big-screen breakdown". [...] "When she does finally crack," [...] writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, [...] "it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore." [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is [...] "peerless" [...] in her [...] "portraits of troubled womanhood." [...] When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is [...] "a bit of a bore". [...] "Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty," [...] he says, [...] "and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of." ...|$|E
500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at {{the back end of}} last season and I was out of contract and because of all the deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. <b>There</b> <b>comes</b> a time when you can't wait any longer and I needed to sort my future out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E
