500|$|End of the Century was {{described}} by the band as an album written solely to gain popularity, resulting in more of a pop punk sound. Joey failed {{to contribute to the}} best of his abilities on the album and recalled: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the worst crap I ever wrote went on the album. That was me at my worst." [...] Johnny also felt that the album was far from the band's prime.|$|E
2500|$|York {{was paid}} off and in February 1802 Ferrier {{received}} {{an appointment to}} command the 74-gun [...] [...] There was no immediate service available after {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Amiens later that year, but on the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Albion became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez on the Channel station. The squadron patrolled the Channel against French raiders, and on 28 May 1803 she captured the 40-gun French frigate Franchise while in company with the 74-gun ships [...] and [...] Albion was then ordered to the West Indies where on 21 December she captured the 12-gun privateer Clarisse. Ferrier then sailed for the East Indies, encountering a homeward-bound fleet of East Indiamen in February 1804, in the Strait of Malacca. The fleet, under Commodore Nathaniel Dance, had narrowly escaped capture by a powerful French squadron under Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois. Despite the massive French superiority Dance had successfully defended his convoy and by leading Linois to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his merchants were actually warships, drove away the French at the Battle of Pulo Aura. Proceeding through the strait, Dance and his convoy came across Ferrier in HMS Albion, and accompanied by the 74-gun , and were escorted as far as Saint Helena. They arrived safely there on 9 June 1804.|$|E

50|$|Some {{experts are}} {{skeptical about the}} {{prospects}} of projects-winners of GenerationS. Thus, an expert on mobile communication and content services Sergey Polovnikov <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most promising technology start-ups involved in GenerationS 2015, did not win the main prize, but was withdrawn from the competition by the corporate partners for the purpose to not disclose the information about know-hows.|$|R
50|$|Ryder beats up a {{group of}} Reno's thugs who are beating a local drug user named Billy (Jonny Cruz). White Deer (August Schellenberg), the father of Nancy and J.J., talks to Nancy's 15-year-old {{daughter}} Kiowa (Chelsea Ricketts), who is Junior's older sister. Kiowa believes that J.J., {{who was a member}} of the tribal council, was killed because he knew something about Reno. Kiowa <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the tribal council members might be on Reno's side.|$|R
25|$|If the Prime Minister <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> clauses <b>of</b> {{existing}} {{statute law}} instead {{belong to the}} domain of regulations, he can also ask the Council to reclassify these clauses as regulations.|$|R

6000|$|... "How dreadful to think," [...] said Katie, {{making a}} hard {{struggle}} to suppress her agitation, [...] "that all these {{would have been}} lost but for the lifeboat; and how wonderful to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> our own friends should be among them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Adolay laughed lightly. [...] "And don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Fire-spouters {{have also}} {{a good deal of}} determination--especially one of them who left the lodges of his people and wandered over the great salt lake all alone in search of his child?" ...|$|E
5000|$|After they {{go inside}} the cottage, they decide to drink. The two begin to discuss {{a variety of topics}} while drinking, such as {{different}} books they’re reading. Bill likes G. K. Chesterton, while Nick prefers Hugh Walpole. They also discuss baseball; apparently, the two of them are both fans of the St. Louis Cardinals, but Nick <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the games they lose are rigged, claiming “there’s always more to it than we know about.” They continue to drink and add logs to the fire. The topic of conversation moves onto their fathers and their differing occupations. Nick’s dad is a doctor, while Bill’s is a painter.|$|R
60|$|I am {{the more}} {{inclined}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> course <b>of</b> this kind is indicated to the Christian world, from the reproaches and taunts which proslavery papers are casting upon us, for patronizing their cotton. At all events, the Quakers escape the awkwardness of this dilemma.|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessor}} of {{the modern}} days Hajdúdorog was founded around {{the beginning of the}} 12th century. The center of the medieval town should have been around the present area of the cathedral. The manuscripts from 1312 name the town Dorogegyháza meaning Church of Dorog. This let historians <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> sort <b>of</b> Catholic church stood {{in the center of the}} settlement, probably in the place of today's cathedral.|$|R

6000|$|... "Have {{you seen}} {{anything}} of the Indians since you left the stockade, Strides?" [...] demanded the captain. [...] "We can perceive no other traces of their presence than yonder fires, though we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them must have passed this way, for Whiteback's udder is empty." ...|$|E
60|$|It came {{in my mind}} she {{had been}} more than common {{particular}} that day upon my dress: and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the same care had been bestowed upon Catriona. For so merry and sensible a lady, Miss Grant was certainly wonderful taken up with duds.|$|E
60|$|Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> artists <b>of</b> merit {{have been}} excluded, or that artists whom you think not deserving of that honor have been elected?--More; that artists not deserving of the honor have been elected. I {{think it does}} no harm to any {{promising}} artist {{to be left out}} of the Academy, but it does harm to the public sometimes that an unpromising artist should be let into it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you not <b>think</b> perhaps <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the {{shortcoming}} {{lies with}} yourself?" [...] continued Mr. Furlong. [...] "Is it not possible {{that as a}} preacher you fail somewhat, do not, as it were, deal sufficiently with fundamental things as others do? You leave untouched the truly vital issues, {{such things as the}} creation, death, and, if I may refer to it, the life beyond the grave." ...|$|R
500|$|Capuano {{considered}} {{running for}} Governor of Massachusetts in 2014. On January 21, 2013, former Mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts {{and member of}} the Massachusetts Governor's Council Michael Albano endorsed Capuano to run, posting on his Facebook page: [...] "while the Congressman has not made a decision to compete for the [...] nomination [...] at this time, it is not too early to make the case and encourage his candidacy." [...] When asked in February 2013 whether he might run for governor, Capuano responded: [...] "Part <b>of</b> me <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the more interesting, more important fights {{over the next several years}} might be conducted at statehouses around the country and not necessarily on Capitol Hill." [...] In a statement in September 2013, Capuano announced he would not run for governor, and would instead focus on running for re-election to Congress. His decision was attributed to his loss against Martha Coakley in the Democratic primary for Senate, virtually closing any possibility for running for higher office.|$|R
60|$|The Rough Riders left Cuba on August 7, {{just six}} weeks {{and a half after}} landing. The time spent in the island had been short, but to many it seemed an age. None were sorry to depart, {{although}} sad to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the sick had to be left behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! you {{do better}} than any one else could. But, you see, the other fellows--I mean the Board--may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them ought to have an office.

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> us are hardier for transplanting," [...] he replied. [...] "It {{is easier}} to make a vigorous growth out in the open, {{in the wind and}} the sun. Besides, over yonder every one is pinched and trimmed back to the same conventional pattern. They sacrifice too much for uniformity." ...|$|E
60|$|Dean Drone, <b>of</b> course, and <b>some</b> {{others were}} quieter about it, {{and said that}} one must make {{allowances}} and that naturally there were two sides to everything. But most of them wouldn't listen to reason at all. I <b>think,</b> perhaps, <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them were frightened. You see the last time but one that the steamer had sunk, {{there had been a}} man drowned and it made them nervous.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{funny thing}} about Hollywood {{is that they are}} {{interested}} in having you do one thing and do it well and do it ever after," [...] said O'Brien. [...] "That's the sad thing about being a leading man - while the rewards may be great in fame and finances, it becomes monotonous for an actor. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> why <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the people who are continually playing themselves are not happy." ...|$|R
40|$|Anti-expertise, or self-defeating belief, {{leads to}} {{incoherent}} personal credences. <b>Some</b> philosophers <b>think</b> <b>that</b> anti-expertise is irrational but avoidable (probabilism), others <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> cases <b>of</b> anti-expertise are rational (anti-probabilism), {{and still others}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> anti-expertise is irrational and unavoidable (nihilism about rationality). Taking as premises some standard assumptions about the Sleeping Beauty Problem, I prove that if Beauty maintains public credences then she is prone to anti-expertise unless she embraces optimism, i. e. denies that she will experience multiple awakenings if tails. ...|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not doubt}} {{but you might}} make a very {{valuable}} collection of Jacobite songs--but would it give no offence?

6000|$|... "Well;--yes. I {{think he}} would, upon the whole. I'm sure of this: {{he would not}} disapprove, because the new ways are changed from his ways. He never thought himself infallible.

6000|$|... "Faix we've {{done nothing}} of the sort," [...] {{retorted}} Tom Collins, who was examining the carcase. [...] "It's been dead for hours, and is quite cold. Every bullet has missed, too, for the shot that settled him {{is on the side}} next the ground. So much for hasty shooting.

40|$|Beghini et al (Struct Multidisc Optim doi: 10. 1007 /s 00158 - 013 - 1030 - 6, 2013) have {{published}} {{a very interesting}} paper arriving to practically the same nearly optimal solutions for the so named “bridge prob- lem” that the Writers published a year before, but using an alternative and remarkable approach to the problem.

6000|$|... "Mr. Lincoln," [...] she faltered, [...] "I did {{not know}} you when I came here. I should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice praise you.

60|$|I {{had borne}} {{so much from}} him in the past, I believe he thought there was no end to my forbearance, and he was at first amazed. But I have the {{pleasure}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> my expressions had pierced through his thick hide; and besides, the brute was truly a hero of valour, and loved fighting for itself. Whatever the cause, at least, he had soon pulled himself together, and took the thing (to do him justice) handsomely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There are depths {{for those}} who can dive into them; but I really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these {{theological}} questions we view the matter solely from our state of civilisation and thought, and forget the multitudes of uneducated, rude, unrefined people to whom all below the simple meaning is unmeaning.

5000|$|While Croatian {{historian}} Nada Klaić <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> sort <b>of</b> surrender {{occurred in}} 1102, giving the Croatians light terms, Slovenian historians Matjaž Klemenčič and Mitja Žagar believe the Pacta Conventa never actually existed, {{but the story}} about {{it was important to}} support the Croatian position later in the Habsburg Empire of rights on the basis of that agreement. Klemenčič and Žagar <b>think</b> <b>that</b> although Croatia ceased to exist as an independent state, the Croatian nobility retained relatively strong powers. [...] Klaić <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the Trogir manuscript, the earliest text of the alleged pact, is not the text of that surrender, but describes contemporary relations between king and nobility and then traced that current 14th century reality back to an initial agreement.|$|R
