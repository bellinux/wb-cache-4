Specifically, at each {{decision}} {{stage for}} each application in each interval, one resource {{of the appropriate}} flavour is allocated to <b>the</b> bottleneck <b>tier.</b> We <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> utilization law [13] to identify <b>the</b> bottleneck <b>tier.</b> WAM is then invoked to compute Eq. (6) and hence Eq. (7). This process is then repeated for all applications. The resource allocation plan which gives the least SV value is selected and used to obtain the resource allocation plan in the next stage.

50|$|This {{period was}} {{followed}} by a dark era in which Benfica was internally overshadowed by Ovarense, Portugal Telecom and FC Porto. Even though this period {{is considered to be a}} dark one, Benfica did manage to reach the LPB final once as well as winning Super Cups and finishing runners-up in the national cup and in the league cup. Also noteworthy is an away win against Real Madrid, in the 1996-97 EuroCup, the same season the Spaniards won the competition. The team finally decided to withdraw from <b>the</b> top <b>tier</b> and <b>applied</b> for <b>the</b> second league, the Proliga, which was the highest division run by the Federação Portuguesa de Basquetebol. However the first division was folded and the LPB was again being overviewed by the national federation. This allowed the team to make a comeback to the main league.|$|R

40|$|In the {{presented}} work two {{case studies}} using highly reactive Isothiazol- 3 -one biocides and Ionic liquids are presented. It was {{the aim of}} these studies to get a deeper knowledge on the hazard potential of the selected substances by applying a mode of action based testing strategy and a flexible toxicological and ecotoxicological test battery. Summarising the results obtained from both case studies, it could be shown that <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> <b>tiered</b> and mode of action based testing strategy in combination with a flexible test battery was a valuable tool to identify and screen modes of toxic action as well as structure-activity relationships of reactive and non-reactive chemicals. The identified hazard potentials of isothiazol- 3 -one biocides and ionic liquids reduced the uncertainty of their toxicological and ecotoxicological impacts and thus the obtained results {{can lead to a}} refined multidimensional risk assessment of these substances. Additionally, the uncovered structure-activity relationships can be used to design more inherently safer and hence sustainable biocides and ionic liquids. The used T-SAR based approach could be identified as a promising candidate for the above cited 2 ̆ 2 intelligent testing strategies 2 ̆ 2 in the hazard assessment of environmentally relevant chemicals...|$|R
