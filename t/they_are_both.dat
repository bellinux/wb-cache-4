5|$|This {{compliance}} requirement establishes {{that any}} non-federal recipient of federal assistance that passes that assistance, whether in part or in total, to another recipient (known as pass-through entities and subrecipients, respectively) {{is responsible to}} monitor the federal assistance activities of that subrecipient, as well as assure that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> complying with laws and regulations. This requirement {{is based on the}} fact that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> equally responsible for federal funds received. Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits, regular contact, interviews, meetings and examinations of the subrecipient, as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit.|$|E
5|$|Vexillology rarely {{distinguishes between}} gold and yellow; in heraldry, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> Or. For the German flag, such a {{distinction}} is made: the color {{used in the}} flag is gold, not yellow.|$|E
50|$|Hill ran {{two races}} in 1993, his last Cup starts. They both came at Rockingham, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> 38th-place {{finishes}} and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> DNFs. So, with the dismal results, Hill left the Cup Series.|$|R
60|$|M. MAURICE BRUN and M. Armand Armagnac were {{crossing}} the sunlit Champs Elysee {{with a kind}} of vivacious respectability. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> short, brisk and bold. They both had black beards that did not seem to belong to their faces, after the strange French fashion which makes real hair look like artificial. M. Brun had a dark wedge of beard apparently affixed under his lower lip. M. Armagnac, by way of a change, had two beards; one sticking out from each corner of his emphatic chin. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> young. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> atheists, with a depressing fixity of outlook but great mobility of exposition. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> pupils of the great Dr Hirsch, scientist, publicist and moralist.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{the wife}} of Earl Reece Stadtman whom she met when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> {{graduate}} students at the University of California, Berkeley. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> hired by {{what was then the}} National Heart Institute in 1950 becoming the first husband-and-wife team at the National Institutes of Health. They both oversaw their own biochemistry labs and collaborated closely.

5|$|A {{consistent}} {{shift from}} land based trade to sea based trade {{has been recorded}} since the last three millennia. The strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages. Oceanic ports can help forge trading relationships with {{other parts of the}} world easily.|$|E
5|$|A new {{character}} called Kip Berenger (Joseph Cohen-Cole) is introduced, {{a computer}} games expert who followed the uprising {{and is a}} fan of Lioba. While on a dating website in Planet B, he comes into contact with Lioba and offers his help. She is at first reluctant, but when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> attacked by Cerberus they flee together. Kip later reveals that like Lioba he is dead in the real world.|$|E
5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} to conceive {{a child of}} their own, Monica and Chandler discover that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> infertile, and ultimately settle upon adoption as an alternative, deciding to adopt the yet-to-be-born child of expectant single mother Erica (Anna Faris). The couple is very much surprised when Erica gives birth to twins, and name the boy Jack after Monica's father, and the girl Erica after her birth mother.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> now {{a little}} family of three, {{although}} there was a brother who had started away the day before on a bicycling tour very like my own, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> so delighted to have Amy visit the Larramies, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> so delighted to have her come back.|$|R

50|$|The pair {{first met}} in San Miguel de Allende, in Mexico, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> working at Mama Mia's restaurant. Willie on fiddle and Lobo on flamenco guitar jammed on occasion, {{searching for an}} {{individual}} sound. The owner of a local bar <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> playing at suggested they perform together.|$|R
5|$|Another {{strikingly similar}} portrait, {{depicting}} a woman also credited as Jane– although the costume differs slightly– was {{once owned by}} Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but is now in an undisclosed private collection. Owing to similarities between the two works, Edwards suggests <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio. A third copy, once owned by the English costume designer Herbert Norris, is known through records, although its whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|At the RV park, Mulder finds Ronnie. As {{he tries}} to arrest him, Mulder is {{surrounded}} and overwhelmed {{by a group of}} people with glowing green eyes. He wakes up the next morning in the RV park, in his car, where he is rejoined by Scully. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> unharmed and the vampires have disappeared. Back in Washington, they give their unified report to Skinner, who is dumbfounded by what he has heard.|$|E
5|$|From an {{ecological}} perspective, raptor populations {{in urban areas}} are highly beneficial. Compared with Europe where pigeon populations have exploded to the point <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> a tourist attraction and a public nuisance. Their faeces are highly acidic causing damage to historic buildings and statues made of soft stone. They nest in bridges where it compiles and damages iron work causing rust and corrosion. In the United States, falcon and other raptors are in numbers high enough to ward off pigeon nest building in major highrises.|$|E

5|$|Kurt and Blaine {{attend a}} party hosted by New Directions co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). The {{attendees}} play spin the bottle, {{which results in}} Rachel and Blaine kissing. In the aftermath, Blaine wonders whether he might be bisexual, and goes {{on a date with}} Rachel. When she kisses him again while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> sober, he concludes that he is indeed gay, which relieves Kurt.|$|E
5|$|The fifth-brightest star is Zeta Apodis at {{magnitude}} 4.8, a star that has swollen and cooled {{to become an}} orange giant of spectral type K1III, with a surface temperature of 4649 K and a luminosity 133 {{times that of the}} Sun. It is 297 ± 8 light-years distant. Near Zeta is Iota Apodis, a binary star system around 1300 light-years distant, that is composed of two blue-white main sequence stars that orbit each other every 59.32 years. Of spectral types B9V and B9.5 V, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> over three times as massive as the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, Blackadder calls Field Marshal Haig and {{reminds him}} of his debt; Haig reluctantly advises using the underpants method, and abruptly hangs up, sealing Blackadder's fate. Darling arrives, and his animosity with Blackadder dissolves as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> put in the same situation. George tries to cheer everybody up, but finds himself as scared as the others. Darling states that {{he had hoped to}} live through the War, return to England and marry his fiancée.|$|E

25|$|Brian Draper {{spent most}} of his {{childhood}} living with his family in the state of Utah. He and his family moved to Pocatello, Idaho. He attended local schools and met Idaho native Torey Adamcik when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> students at Pocatello High School. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> interested in movies and started recording their own.|$|R

5|$|The {{western front}} facade {{is flanked by}} two square towers. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> three stories high topped with silver domes and a Christian cross on top of these. Both towers have windows at each level. Access to the towers is through either of two small wooden doors located in the {{interior}} northwest and southwest corners of the church vestibule.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> naive {{about sex}} and technology. Tracy, for example, {{attempts}} to telephone Robert to inform him that he's lost his mobile phone, and believes {{that she is a}} lesbian when she discovers her husband in women's clothing. They have a baby, who is seen or referred to occasionally. This reflects, as the writer observes, Moffat's inexperience of looking after children at the time.|$|E
5|$|Tyrion asks Tywin to {{be named}} heir to House Lannister's ancestral home Casterly Rock. Tywin angrily refuses and threatens to hang Shae if she is found in his bed again, but does have Tyrion named as Master of Coin, the treasurer. He also forces Tyrion to marry Sansa Stark against his will, though both decide not to consummate the marriage. Tyrion and Sansa begin to bond as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> outcasts in King's Landing, until Sansa discovers that her mother Catelyn and brother Robb have been murdered {{as a result of}} Tywin's scheming.|$|E

5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> unstable.|$|E
5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus {{he is unable to}} persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E
