On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we <b>teach</b> <b>our</b> children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

For instance, the Handbook notes that [...] "there is no specific Bible command that says, 'Thou shalt not be late to class', but a student who wishes to display orderliness and concern for others will not come in late to the distraction of the teacher and other students." [...] In 2008 a campus spokesman also said that one goal of the dress code was [...] "to <b>teach</b> <b>our</b> young people to dress professionally" [...] on campus while giving them [...] "the ability to...choose within the biblically accepted options of dress" [...] when they were off campus.|$|E

My feeling is these 'yordim' should not be accorded honors in our synagogues or schools. These people are the antithesis of what we want to <b>teach</b> <b>our</b> children, of how we want to live.

2500|$|Prior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again {{sought to}} discard Coleman, {{asking him to}} report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. [...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000.

Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there. Maybe he can do all right. He doesn't throw hard enough now to break a pane of glass. He was spending his spare time trying to <b>teach</b> <b>our</b> young guys to pitch.
