5|$|Humans are {{corporeal}} beings and, as such, {{they are}} subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> sciences furnish of human beings {{play an important role in}} the philosophy of mind. There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: biology, computer science, cognitive science, cybernetics, linguistics, medicine, pharmacology, and psychology.|$|E
5|$|The band {{insisted on}} playing live, and brought their regular touring gear with them. Their roadie, Peter Watts, {{suggested}} that their 16-track recorder {{would produce a}} sound comparable to a studio recording. In addition, it transpired <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> echo of the amphitheatre provided good acoustics for the recording.The equipment was carried by truck from London, and took three days to reach Pompeii. When it arrived, it was discovered there was insufficient power to drive the equipment correctly. This issue plagued filming for several days, and was finally resolved by running a lengthy cable from the local town hall.|$|E

5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E
5|$|Specimens {{assigned}} to Pteranodon {{have been found}} in both the Smoky Hill Chalk deposits of the Niobrara Formation, and the slightly younger Sharon Springs deposits of the Pierre Shale Formation. When Pteranodon was alive, this area was covered by a large inland sea, known as the Western Interior Seaway. Famous for fossils collected since 1870, these formations extend from as far south as Kansas in the United States to Manitoba in Canada. However, Pteranodon specimens (or any pterosaur specimens) have only been found in the southern half of the formation, in Kansas, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Despite the fact that numerous fossils {{have been found in}} the contemporary parts of the formation in Canada, no pterosaur specimens have ever been found there. This strongly suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> geographic range of Pteranodon covered only {{the southern part of the}} Niobrara, and that its habitat did not extend farther north than South Dakota.|$|E
