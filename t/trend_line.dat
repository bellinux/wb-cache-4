25|$|A <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> {{represents}} a trend, the long-term movement in time series data after other components have been accounted for. It tells {{whether a particular}} data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> could simply be drawn by eye {{through a set of}} data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression. Trend lines typically are straight lines, although some variations use higher degree polynomials depending on the degree of curvature desired in the line.|$|E

The new morphologic dating methods suggest that cinder cone formation in the Potrillo volcanic field may have occurred at different intervals and that the field may be currently developing new cinder cones. The cinder cone slope distribution in the Potrillo volcanic field suggests that volcanism occurred at different time intervals. In addition, <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> analysis provides a powerful and useful tool for predicting cinder cone ages in the Potrillo volcanic field.

The United States Census Department shows {{a higher percentage of}} uninsured for the same years but a similar <b>trend</b> <b>line.</b> Both trend lines mirror—from different baselines—the approximately 400,000 Massachusetts residents added to the rolls of the insured in 2006/2007 via an expansion in Medicaid eligibility rules and the subsidization of the Commonwealth Care insurance program.|$|E

The rapid identification of relevant <b>trend</b> <b>lines</b> when they are in their initial phase of their development could provide interesting projections for the future evolution of time-series.

Though there was considerable scatter (now known {{to be caused by}} peculiar velocities – the 'Hubble flow' is used to refer to the region of space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities), Hubble was able to plot a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value for the Hubble constant of 500km/s/Mpc (much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in his distance calibrations).

50|$|At {{the start}} of what a trader is hoping is a bull trend, after the first higher low, a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> {{can be drawn from}} the low at {{the start of}} the trend to the higher low and then extended. When the market moves across this <b>trend</b> <b>line,</b> it has {{generated}} a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> break for the trader, who is given several considerations from this point on. If the market moved with a particular rhythm to-and-fro from the <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> with regularity, the trader will give the <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> added weight. Any significant <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> that sees a significant <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> break represents a shift in the balance of the market and is interpreted as the first sign that the countertrend traders are able to assert some control.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trend</b> <b>line</b> breaks {{can be used}} to {{generate}} signals. Trend lines can be drawn connecting the peaks and troughs. From oversold levels, an advance above −100 and <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> breakout could be considered bullish. From overbought levels, a decline below +100 and a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> break could be considered bearish.|$|E

Inevitably, the values derived from Eaton’s sonic method for predicting pore pressure yielded lower values, as deduced from Equations 1.4. The reduction in pore pressure values influenced a resulting decrease in fracture gradients values which are linked by the Eaton fracture gradient method—Eq.  1.6.|$|R
