5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from {{carrying out the}} Sejny Uprising. Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more opposed to the proposed union with Poland (see Międzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising. While locally successful, it led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the nationwide coup.|$|E

5|$|Gonen, {{starting}} to realise {{the gravity of}} Adan's position, ordered Sharon at 14:45 to pull back and return to his initial positions. The Erez Armored Brigade arrived to offer assistance to Keren, but poor coordination between the commanders led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> further attempts to capture Hamutal Hill.

5|$|Despite several counterattacks {{during the}} afternoon, the New Zealanders {{managed to hold}} their front line, {{including}} the village of Flers, although both flanks remained exposed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> 41st and 47th Divisions to reach or hold their frontage of the Blue Line. It was a successful day for the division; it had captured the most ground of all the divisions of XV Corps involved in the battle. It had also reached all four of its objectives although it ended the day in possession of three plus Flers itself, which was actually in 41st Division's sector.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the {{uprising}} was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness {{of some of}} the PMO activists. Piłsudski failed to discourage local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising in the Suwałki Region. The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched {{the uprising}}, which while locally successful, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the nationwide coup. PMO members in Lithuania stated that the Sejny uprising had damaged their reputation, and many of its former supporters rejected calls by PMO recruiters.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did not produce another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at Chrysalis Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, and the formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

This regiment saw no combat, but during the last six months of his European tour, he commanded Company D, 15th Separate Marine Battalion, which had been organized {{for the express purpose of}} assisting in the holding of a plebiscite in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the United States to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, this mission, however, was never carried out.|$|E

The shifting dynamic of the global economy such as the emergence of fast growing economies in, for example, India, China, South Africa and Brazil can be partly explained by the emergence of new market players such as the India transnational car manufacturer Tata, as well as the adaptation of established international businesses in <b>the</b> West <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new market opportunities in the South and the East. Equally, the recent (and in places ongoing) economic crises of the West owes as much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> international business — notably the banking and investment industry — as it does <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> government policy...|$|R

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an {{emissary}} to Norway {{to discuss}} the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched a vicious attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was {{at the height of}} his power, and his only son had just recently been recognised as heir to the throne.|$|E
5|$|In 1839, threats by the {{imperial}} court of Qing to place sanctions on opium imports caused diplomatic friction with the British Empire. Tensions escalated into the First Opium War. The Qing admitted defeat when British forces captured Hong Kong Island on 20 January 1841. The island was initially ceded under the Convention of Chuenpi {{as part of}} a ceasefire agreement between Captain Charles Elliot and Governor Qishan. A dispute between high-ranking officials of both countries, however, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the treaty's ratification. On 29 August 1842, Hong Kong Island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Treaty of Nanking. The British officially established a Crown colony and founded the City of Victoria in the following year.|$|E

The game was to be an Xbox exclusive title, developed by Infinite Machine, a small company consisting {{of a number of}} former LucasArts employees. The story of the game was developed by Purcell and fellow designer Chuck Jordan and involved the Freelance Police travelling the galaxy to find a stolen Statue of Liberty. However, Infinite Machine went bankrupt within a year, partially due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> their first game, New Legends, and the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Koht's {{views on}} the Norwegian {{language}} also garnered him nationwide academic recognition. He championed the Samnorsk language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language in this direction was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was {{a founding member of}} the Norwegian Peace Association and an ordinary member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic, and nurturing a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.|$|E

Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for Nintendo hardware.|$|E

5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} dive bombing became so popular among the {{leadership}} of the Luftwaffe that it became almost obligatory in new aircraft designs. Later bomber models like the Junkers Ju 88 and the Dornier Do 217 were equipped for dive bombing. The Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber was initially supposed to have dive bombing capabilities, a requirement that contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the design, with the requirement not rescinded until September 1942 by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.|$|E
5|$|The {{joined forces}} of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to Damietta on 27 October 1169, but the siege was {{unsuccessful}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co-operate fully. According to Byzantine forces, Amalric, {{not wanting to}} share the profits of victory, dragged out the operation until the emperor's men ran short of provisions and were particularly affected by famine; Amalric then launched an assault, which he promptly aborted by negotiating a truce with the defenders. On the other hand, William of Tyre remarked that the Greeks were not entirely blameless.
