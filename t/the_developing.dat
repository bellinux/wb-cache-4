5|$|Many wasp {{species are}} parasitoids; the females deposit eggs on or {{in a host}} {{arthropod}} on which the larvae then feed. Some larvae start off as parasitoids, but convert at a later stage to consuming the plant tissues that their host is feeding on. In other species, the eggs are laid directly into plant tissues and form galls, which protect <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> larvae from predators but not necessarily from other parasitic wasps. In some species, the larvae are predatory themselves; the wasp eggs are deposited in clusters of eggs laid by other insects, and these are then consumed by <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> wasp larvae.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop suitable English speaking learning materials for the personnel of small-scale craft industries and Department of Industry, Trade, and Cooperatives of Kebumen district. The English speaking learning materials are <b>developed</b> to fulfill <b>the</b> needs of the personnel for suitable English speaking learning materials. The English speaking learning materials are used to <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> personnel’s English speaking skill. They need to improve their English speaking competence in order to be able to communicate with foreign buyers when they conduct craft exhibition in international craft trade fairs. The nature of this research is a Research and Development (R&D). <b>The</b> process of <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> English speaking learning materials is preceded with needs assessment by interviewing one craftsman and two officers of the department from Kebumen district to find the learners’ needs in learning English. The information obtained from the needs assessment then is used as <b>the</b> basis to <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> materials. After that, <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> English speaking learning materials are tried-out to twenty participants that consist of fourteen craftsmen and six officers of the department from Kebumen district. Evaluation on <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> materials is then carried out by distributing questionnaire to the participants after the try-outs of the materials. The aim of the questionnaire is to obtain the participants’ feedback and opinions about the materials.
