5|$|To the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate {{conditions}} obtain. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29°C (84°F) and nights around 12°C (54°F) with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around 41°C (106°F) and nights no lower than 29°C (84°F). In {{the weeks before}} <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> temperatures {{are similar to the}} above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with <b>the</b> <b>monsoon.</b> Temperatures are around 35°C (95°F) but humidity is very high; nights are around 27°C (81°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> season.|$|E
5|$|Although Chan-hom did not {{directly}} affect the Philippines, both Chan-hom and Tropical Storm Linfa enhanced <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> for several days, which caused severe flooding throughout the country. Heavy rains impacted portions of Luzon and the Western Visayas, with various events resulting in five deaths.

5|$|This basin’s {{season has}} a double peak: one in April and May, before {{the onset of}} <b>the</b> <b>monsoon,</b> and another in October and November, just after. This double peak occurs because {{powerful}} vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> season tears apart incipient cyclones. High shear explains why no cyclones can form in the Red Sea, which possesses the necessary depth, vorticity and surface temperatures year-round. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Aided by <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> trough, {{the outer}} rainbands of Typhoon Ruby brought an {{extended}} period of heavy rains across eastern Taiwan. According to press reports, one person was killed and another was initially reported as missing. River levels rose drastically, which led to flooding along low-lying areas.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{agricultural}} operations on land, food production especially in India, depend on {{the success or failure of}} <b>the</b> <b>monsoons.</b> Russel and Yonge (1947) while discussing seasonal cycle of plankton organisms in the tropical areas, state that "there are dry and rainy periods, <b>the</b> <b>monsoons,</b> and weather conditions that alternate with unfailing regularity during the year and it is more than probable that these secular changes may have their effect upon life in the sea". The effect of <b>the</b> <b>monsoons</b> has also been pointed out by Kow (1953) for the Malay region.

50|$|<b>The</b> Indian <b>Monsoon</b> Current {{refers to}} the {{seasonally}} varying ocean current regime found in the tropical regions of the northern Indian Ocean. During winter, {{the flow of the}} upper ocean is directed westward from near the Indonesian Archipelago to the Arabian Sea. During the summer, the direction reverses, with eastward flow extending from Somalia into the Bay of Bengal. These variations are due to changes in the wind stress associated with <b>the</b> Indian <b>monsoon.</b> <b>The</b> seasonally reversing open ocean currents that pass south of India are referred to as <b>the</b> Winter <b>Monsoon</b> Current and <b>the</b> Summer <b>Monsoon</b> Current (alternately, <b>the</b> Northeast <b>Monsoon</b> Current and <b>the</b> Southwest <b>Monsoon</b> Current). <b>The</b> Somali Current, which is strongly linked to <b>the</b> Indian <b>monsoon,</b> is also discussed in this article.|$|R

5|$|From 1965 through 1968, {{the war in}} the {{northeast}} followed <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> cycle, with dry season communist offensives followed by wet season Hmong (and later Thai) counteroffensives.

5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as <b>the</b> <b>monsoon.</b> Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E

50|$|The country {{experiences}} two <b>monsoon</b> seasons, <b>the</b> Northeast <b>Monsoon</b> and <b>the</b> Southwest <b>Monsoon.</b> <b>The</b> Northeast <b>Monsoon</b> brings {{heavy rainfall}} {{to the east}} coast of Peninsular Malaysia and western Sarawak, while <b>the</b> Southwest <b>Monsoon</b> signifies dryer conditions throughout the country except Sabah. During <b>the</b> Southwest <b>Monsoon,</b> most states experience minimal rainfall due to the stable atmospheric conditions in the region and the Sumatran mountain range, which brings about the rain shadow effect. Sabah experiences more rainfall because of the tail effect of typhoons in the Philippines.|$|R

5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction in solar radiation at the surface may have led to the failure of <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On June27, 2002, <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> trough {{spawned a}} {{tropical}} disturbance southwest of Pohnpei. The system rapidly organized that day, and at 2000UTC the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. Early on June28, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified {{the system as}} a tropical depression near the Mortlock Islands in the Federated States of Micronesia; around the same time, the JTWC also initiated storm advisories. Early on June29, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm 08W, and shortly thereafter the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Chataan. After moving northwestward, the storm turned to the east, resuming a northwest track on June30 due to a subtropical ridge to the north. The track was erratic because the storm had not yet separated from <b>the</b> <b>monsoon</b> trough. By June30, Chataan had steadily strengthened to severe tropical storm status, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 95km/h (60mph).|$|E

50|$|A correct {{scientific}} {{explanation about}} {{the formation of}} a chakara is debatable.

40|$|The {{response}} of the six major summer <b>monsoon</b> systems (<b>the</b> North American <b>monsoon,</b> <b>the</b> northern Africa <b>monsoon,</b> <b>the</b> Asia <b>monsoon,</b> <b>the</b> northern Australasian <b>monsoon,</b> <b>the</b> South America <b>monsoon</b> and <b>the</b> southern Africa <b>monsoon)</b> to mid-Holocene orbital forcing has been investigated using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (FOAM), with {{the focus on the}} distinct roles of the direct insolation forcing and oceanic feedback. The simulation result is also found to compare well with the NCAR CSM. The direct effects of the change in insolation produce an enhancement of <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere <b>monsoons</b> and a reduction of <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere <b>monsoons.</b> Ocean feedbacks produce a further enhancement of <b>the</b> northern Africa <b>monsoon</b> and <b>the</b> North American <b>monsoon.</b> However, ocean feedbacks appear to weaken <b>the</b> Asia <b>monsoon,</b> although <b>the</b> overall effect (direct insolation forcing plus ocean feedback) remains a strengthened <b>monsoon.</b> <b>The</b> impact of ocean feedbacks on the South American and southern African monsoons is relatively small, and therefore these regions, especially the South America, experienced a reduced monsoon regime compared to present. However, there is a strong ocean feedback on <b>the</b> northern Australian <b>monsoon</b> that negates <b>the</b> direct effects of orbital changes and results in a strengthening of austral summer monsoon precipitation in this region. A new synthesis is made for mid-Holocene paleoenvironmental records and is compared with the model simulations. Overall, model simulations produce changes in regional climates that are generally consistent with paleoenvironmental observations. [References: 135...|$|R
