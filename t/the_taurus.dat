5|$|Because of {{its natural}} {{strategic}} {{position on a}} small peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea below <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> Mountains, Alanya has been a local stronghold for many Mediterranean-based empires, including the Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. Alanya's greatest political importance came in the Middle Ages, with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm {{under the rule of}} Alaeddin Kayqubad I, from whom the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city's landmarks, such as the Kızıl Kule (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and Alanya Castle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since the Tornado's introduction, {{all of the}} Tornado {{operators}} have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow recently introduced weapons {{to be used by}} their squadrons. Amongst the new armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the enhanced Paveway and Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs, and modern cruise missiles such as <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> and Storm Shadow missiles; these upgrades have increased the Tornado's capabilities and combat accuracy. Precision weapons such as cruise missiles have replaced older munitions such as cluster bombs.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine force went on {{to invade}} Arzanene. Philippicus besieged Chlomaron, the chief city of the area. At this point, Jovius and Maruthas, two local leaders, {{defected}} to the Byzantines. They promised to help locate the ideal positions for building impregnable forts that would control the passage through <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> Mountains and Hakkâri, allowing the Byzantines to control the routes that connected Arzanene with Persarmenia and Lower Mesopotamia. Philippicus assigned Heraclius the Elder, noted at this point as his second-in-command (hypostrategos), to follow the guides to the strong points indicated.|$|E

5|$|Tigranes, who was {{residing}} at Tigranocerta in {{the summer}} of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but {{by the fact that he}} had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a certain period of time, he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000 to 3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the defense of his namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> Mountains. Nevertheless, Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in <b>the</b> <b>Taurus.</b> Lucullus, nevertheless, chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an unimpeded path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a treaty}} of {{alliance}} with Attalus, Antiochus crossed <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> in 216BC, attacked Achaeus and besieged Sardis, and in 214BC, {{the second year of}} the siege, was able to take the city. However the citadel remained under Achaeus' control. Under the pretense of a rescue, Achaeus was finally captured and put to death, and the citadel surrendered. By 213BC, Antiochus had regained control of all of his Asiatic provinces.|$|E

5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> fell under the sway of Rome.|$|E
5|$|At this point, again {{according}} to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon, who found him and delivered an offer by the Patriarch of Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> Mountains or in the Tauric peninsula, i.e. the Crimea). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon (ca. 1375). At the same time, the Patriarch of Constantinople Philotheos I Kokkinos heard about his dealings in the east, and at Trebizond Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.|$|E
5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> into Cilicia. After a {{long pause}} due to illness, he marched on towards Syria.

Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E

5|$|On 9 February 782, Harun {{departed}} Baghdad; the Arabs crossed <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> Mountains by the Cilician Gates, and swiftly {{took the}} border fortress of Magida. They then advanced along the military roads across the plateau into Phrygia.

Harun himself, with the main army, advanced to the Opsician Theme.

5|$|The Battle of Andrassos or Adrassos was an {{engagement}} fought in autumn 960 in an unidentified mountain pass on <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> Mountains, between the Byzantines, led by Leo Phokas the Younger, {{and the forces}} of the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo under the emir Sayf al-Dawla. Taking advantage of the absence of much of the Byzantine army on campaign against the Emirate of Crete, the Hamdanid prince invaded Asia Minor and raided widely. On his return, however, his army was ambushed by Leo Phokas at the pass of Andrassos. Sayf al-Dawla himself barely escaped, but his army was annihilated. Following a series of Byzantine defeats in the previous years, this battle finally broke the power of the Hamdanid emirate.|$|E

5|$|The peace {{lasted until}} the end of the Muslim civil war in 661, from which Mu'awiya and his clan emerged victorious, {{establishing}} the Umayyad Caliphate. From the next year, Muslim attacks recommenced, with pressure mounting as Muslim armies began wintering on Byzantine soil west of <b>the</b> <b>Taurus</b> range, maximizing the disruption caused to the Byzantine economy. These land expeditions were sometimes coupled with naval raids against the coasts of southern Asia Minor. In 668, the Arabs sent aid to Saborios, strategos of the Armeniac Theme, who had rebelled and proclaimed himself emperor. The Arab troops under Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd arrived too late to assist Saborios, who had died after falling from his horse, and they spent the winter in the Hexapolis around Melitene awaiting reinforcements.|$|E
