5|$|Ducks are {{medium-sized}} aquatic {{birds with}} broad bills, {{eyes on the}} side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.|$|E
5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E

He wanted her, but emotions did not play a role.|$|E
25|$|Coaching {{challenges}}: {{coaches are}} allowed two challenges per game. If the play stands as called after {{the play is}} reviewed, they lose a timeout; however, if it is reversed <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> timeout. If a team wins two straight challenges they are granted a third. In lieu of coaching challenges, all reviews are automatic {{in the final minute}} of each half & in all overtime periods, as does scoring plays & turnovers.|$|E
25|$|Including fish as {{a regular}} part of a {{balanced}} diet has been shown to help the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis â€“ a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility. Studies also show that sufferers feel less stiff and sore in the morning if <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> fish oil intake topped up. Recent research has also found a link between omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether eating more fish could help prevent the disease.|$|E

25|$|Snakes use smell {{to track}} their prey. They smell by using their forked tongues to collect {{airborne}} particles, then passing {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ or Jacobson's organ in the mouth for examination. The fork in the tongue gives snakes a sort of directional sense of smell and taste simultaneously. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> tongues constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment. In water-dwelling snakes, such as the anaconda, the tongue functions efficiently underwater.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that {{tens of thousands}} of Kirishitan still survived in some regions near Nagasaki. Some officially returned to the Roman Catholic Church. Others remained apart from the Catholic Church and have stayed as Kakure Kirishitan, retaining their own traditional beliefs and their descendants asserting that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> ancestors' religion. However, it became difficult for them to keep their community and rituals, so they have converted to Buddhism or Shinto eventually. When John Paul II visited Nagasaki in 1981, he baptized some young people from Kakure Kirishitan families, a rare occurrence.|$|E
25|$|Colour Bearers {{get their}} name from {{a band of}} purple they wear as {{insignia}} on their uniform, purple {{being one of the}} school colours. They are elected by the pupils and the staff, similar to Eton's Pop, and have important roles in the school community as a whole. Unlike captains <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> positions for a whole year unless they are demoted which is usually the punishment for untoward behaviour. They meet every week with the Headmaster to attend {{to a wide range of}} school matters. As well as this they are responsible for maintaining the refectory and the library and for serving drinks behind the bar at the weekly socials in addition to organising major school wide events that take place throughout the year.|$|E

500|$|Western Armenia {{refers to}} an {{undefined}} area, now in eastern Turkey, that had significant Armenian population prior to the Armenian Genocide of 1915. As {{a result of the}} genocide, officially no Armenians live in the area today. However, at least two groups of Armenian origin reside in the area. Hemshin peoples, a islamisized group with Armenian ethnic origin, live in the Black Sea coast, particularity in the Rize province. Another group, Crypto-Armenians or [...] "secret" [...] Armenians, live throughout Turkey, especially the eastern parts of the country. It is impossible to determine how many there are due to this(the fact <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> identity hidden). estimates range from millions to the low 100,000s depending on the criteria used to determine it. since the Armenian Genocide, the area has been mostly inhabited by Kurds and Turks, with smaller numbers of Azerbaijanis (near the Turkish-Armenian border) and Georgians and Laz people in the northeastern provinces of Turkey.|$|E
500|$|Nancy [...] "Nan" [...] Astley is a {{sheltered}} 18-year-old {{living with her}} working-class family and helping in their oyster restaurant in Whitstable, Kent. She becomes instantly and desperately enamoured with a [...] "masher", or male impersonator, named Kitty Butler, who performs for a season at the local theatre. They begin a friendship that grows when, after Kitty finds an opportunity to perform in London for better exposure, she asks Nan to join her. Nan enthusiastically agrees and leaves her family to act as Kitty's dresser while she performs. Although Kitty and Nan acknowledge their relationship to be sisterly, Nan continues to love Kitty until a jealous fight forces Kitty to admit she feels the same, although she insists that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> relationship secret. Simultaneously, Kitty's manager Walter decides that Kitty needs a performing partner to reach true success, and suggests Nan for the role. Nan is initially horrified by the idea, but takes to it. The duo become quite famous until Nan realises she is homesick after being gone from her family {{for more than a}} year. Her return home is underwhelming, so she returns to London early to find Kitty in bed with Walter. They announce that the act is finished and they are to be married.|$|E

500|$|Lucy (Britney Spears), Kit (Zoe Saldana), and Mimi (Taryn Manning) {{are three}} friends {{who live in}} a small Georgia town. While as young children, they bury a [...] "wish box" [...] and vow to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation, also {{pledging}} to stay best friends forever. However, as they grow up, their friendship fades due to their different approaches of high school: Lucy becomes the introverted valedictorian, Kit becomes the most popular girl in school, and Mimi is an outcast from a trailer park and facing teenage pregnancy. On the night of their graduation, <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> promise and get together to open the [...] "wish box". As they start talking again, they remember their old wishes while burying the box: Mimi wanted to travel to California, Lucy wanted to find the mother she cannot remember, and Kit wanted to get married. Mimi brings up the topic of going to Los Angeles for a record contract audition. Kit and Lucy try to convince Mimi to not {{go all the way to}} Los Angeles due to the fact that she's pregnant and anything dangerous can happen. However the next morning they decide to go together but each doing something separate; Mimi going to the audition, Kit visiting her fiancÃ© and Lucy to see her mother in Tucson, Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{criticism}} often {{leveled against}} the Western Rite {{is based on}} the fact that the majority of the members of Western Rite parishes are converts to Orthodoxy. The argument states that Christians want to be Orthodox but [...] "not too Orthodox" [...] so <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> familiar rites under a new bishop. The unstated assumption behind this argument, however, is similar to the argument against all non-Byzantine liturgical traditions: that the Orthodox Church includes only the Byzantine Rite and if people want to be truly Orthodox they must also be Byzantine.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, many {{governments in the}} Middle East often ignore, deny the {{existence}} of, or criminalize homosexuality. Homosexuality is illegal in almost all Muslim countries. Same-sex intercourse officially carries {{the death penalty in}} several Muslim nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mauritania, northern Nigeria, Sudan, and Yemen. [...] Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, during his 2007 speech at Columbia University, asserted that there were no gay people in Iran. However, the probable reason is that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> sexuality a secret for fear of government sanction or rejection by their families.|$|E
