Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a rite of passage. In fact, their initiation rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man can learn to see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into {{the next stage of}} one's existence.|$|E

It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E

Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language.

500|$|For {{the final}} space battle, Bill George {{redesigned}} the photon torpedoes {{to have a}} hotter core and larger flare, because {{he felt that the}} weapons in earlier films looked [...] "too pretty". The torpedoes also moved like guided missiles rather than cannonballs. George told Farrar that he had always wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> penetrate the thin saucer section of the Enterprise, so a replica of the saucer was recreated and blown up; the model was hung upside down so that the explosion could be flipped to approximate the zero gravity effects. Rather than destroy the Bird of Prey model in the climax, pyrotechnic footage was reduced and placed in the appropriate locations to simulate rippling explosions throughout the vessel.|$|E
500|$|Starting on September 29, 1983, a {{layer of}} {{concrete}} was poured {{on top of the}} crushed materials, a rare occurrence in waste disposal. An anonymous workman's stated reason for the concrete was: [...] "There are dead animals down there. We wouldn't want any children to get hurt digging in the dump."

[...] The local manager ordered the dumping to be ended shortly afterwards. Due to Atari's unpopular dumping, Alamogordo later passed an Emergency Management Act and created the Emergency Management Task Force to limit the future flexibility of the garbage contractor to secure outside business for the landfill for monetary purposes.

500|$|An M-class {{dwarf star}} such as Gliese 581 {{has a much}} lower mass than the Sun, causing the core region of the star to fuse {{hydrogen}} at a significantly lower rate. From the apparent magnitude and distance, astronomers have estimated an effective temperature of 3200 K and a visual luminosity of 0.2 percent of that of the Sun.) in a 3-planet system |url=http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/udry_preprint.pdf |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters |volume=469 |issue=3 |pages=L43–L47 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20077612|bibcode=2007A |arxiv=0704.3841 |format=PDF }} However, a red dwarf such as Gliese 581 radiates primarily in the near infrared, with peak emission at a wavelength of roughly 830 nm (estimated using Wien's displacement law, which assumes the star radiates as a black body), so such an estimate will underestimate the star's total luminosity. (For comparison, the peak emission of the Sun is roughly 530nm, {{in the middle of}} the visible part of the spectrum). When radiation over the entire spectrum is taken into account (not just the part that humans are able <b>to</b> <b>see),</b> <b>something</b> known as the bolometric correction, this star has a bolometric luminosity 1.3% of the Sun's total luminosity. A planet would need to be situated much closer to this star in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as the Earth. The region of space around a star where a planet would receive roughly the same energy as the Earth is sometimes termed the [...] "Goldilocks Zone", or, more prosaically, the habitable zone. The extent of such a zone is not fixed and is highly specific for each planetary system.|$|E
500|$|The diverse {{sources of}} funding {{meant that the}} {{production}} team had to field opinions from various sources. Millesime was unhappy with {{certain aspects of the}} story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it [...] "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences [...] "would go nuts with frustration and irritation" [...] if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought [...] "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. [...] "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily want to see them in bed together, but you do want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> like a kiss", she said.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, {{staff writer}} Al Jean {{commented on the}} episode: [...] "The idea of it to parody EC Comics was really {{original}} and kind of shocking for a cartoon on network television. [...] Jim Brooks said, 'We better have a disclaimer {{at the beginning of}} this Halloween show,' so Marge came out and warned people that they were going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> scary. And the funny thing is it's now very tame by our Halloween standards and by network animation standards." [...] According to M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television, the warning only made the episode more attractive to children. The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film Frankenstein. While similar [...] "warnings" [...] were used to open the second and third [...] "Treehouse" [...] episodes, these quickly became a burden to write and there was no warning for the fourth episode. Instead, it had Marge ask Bart to warn people how frightening the show was during his introduction paying homage to Night Gallery. The tradition was revived for [...] "Treehouse of Horror V"; after that, they were permanently dropped and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them. In the opening segment of the episode, and the four subsequent episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous television season and celebrities such as Walt Disney and Jim Morrison. They were last used in [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", which included a solitary tombstone with the words [...] "Amusing Tombstones" [...] to signal this. The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned. Of the series, [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the only one that included a treehouse as a setting. [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a theremin (an early electronic musical instrument), but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes.|$|E
