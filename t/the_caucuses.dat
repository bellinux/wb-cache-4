25|$|The 2012 Republican presidential {{primaries}} {{were the}} selection processes in which voters of the Republican Party elected state delegations to the Republican National Convention. The national convention then selected its nominee {{to run for}} President of the United States in the 2012 presidential election. There were 2,286 delegates chosen, and a candidate needed to accumulate 1,144 delegate votes at the convention to win the nomination. <b>The</b> <b>caucuses</b> allocated delegates to the respective state delegations to the national convention, but the actual election of the delegates were, many times, at a later date. Delegates were elected in different ways that {{vary from state to}} state. They could be elected at local conventions, selected from slates submitted by the candidates, selected at committee meetings, or elected directly at <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> and primaries.|$|E
25|$|Few major {{endorsements}} {{were made}} by major Iowa Republican elected officials. Iowa's governor Terry Branstad endorsed no candidate. Similarly, Senator Chuck Grassley chose not to endorse any candidate. On January 2, U.S. Representative Steve King said on Simon Conway's program on WHO Radio {{that he would not}} endorse before <b>the</b> <b>caucuses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Missouri {{began its}} process of {{selecting}} national delegates with its caucuses from March 17 to April 10. The February primary was non-binding {{and as such}} {{nothing more than a}} non-binding strawpoll. Santorum won The Louisiana delegation securing 10 delegates for himself, but the election process for the major part of the delegates started at <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> on April 28.|$|E
50|$|In December 2007, {{two weeks}} before <b>the</b> 2008 Iowa <b>caucuses,</b> <b>the</b> Register {{endorsed}} Hillary Clinton (in <b>the</b> Democratic <b>caucuses)</b> and John McCain (in <b>the</b> Republican <b>caucuses).</b> In October 2008, the Register endorsed Barack Obama for president in the general election.|$|R
50|$|Slate. A slate {{can be made}} up {{in three}} ways: all {{candidates}} submitting a slate before <b>the</b> primary or <b>caucuses,</b> <b>the</b> winning candidate submitting their slate after <b>the</b> primary or <b>caucuses,</b> or <b>the</b> State Committee or Convention making up the slates before <b>the</b> primary or <b>caucuses.</b> <b>The</b> allocated delegates are then selected from these slates.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>caucuses</b> {{followed}} the regular {{procedures of the}} Democratic Party process. Any voter who was a registered Democrat and a resident of Iowa was eligible {{to participate in the}} event. Individuals could have chosen to register or change their party affiliation at the door. It was estimated that 60 percent of the caucusgoers would have attended <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> for the first time. All of the caucusgoers met in public buildings or schools in their respective precincts and divided themselves into groups; each group represented a candidate. The voting was done publicly (viva voce). To be viable, each preference group/candidate must have had at least 15 percent of the caucusgoers' votes. If a candidate received less than 15 percent of the caucusgoers' votes, then the supporters of that non-viable candidate had 30 minutes to join a viable candidate's group, join another non-viable candidate's group to make the candidate viable, join an uncommitted group, or choose not to be counted as a voter.|$|E
25|$|The state gets {{considerable}} attention {{every four years}} because the Iowa caucus, gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. <b>The</b> <b>caucuses,</b> held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a presidential primary election.|$|E
25|$|He placed {{second in}} MoveOn.org's primary, behind Dean. He also placed first in other polls, {{particularly}} Internet-based ones. This led many activists {{to believe that}} his showing in the primaries might be better than what Gallup polls had been saying. However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote. Support for Kucinich was most prevalent in <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> around the country.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> largest <b>caucuses</b> are <b>the</b> party <b>caucuses</b> and {{conferences}} in the United States Congress, which are <b>the</b> partisan <b>caucuses</b> comprising {{all members of}} one house from one party (either the Democrats or the Republicans) in addition to any Independent members who may caucus with either party. These are the House Democratic Caucus, House Republican Conference, Senate Democratic Caucus, and Senate Republican Conference.|$|R
5000|$|The term caucus is {{frequently}} used {{to discuss the}} procedures used by some states to select presidential nominees such as <b>the</b> Iowa <b>caucuses,</b> <b>the</b> first of the modern presidential election cycle, and <b>the</b> Texas <b>caucuses.</b> Since 1980 such caucuses have become, in the aggregate, {{an important component of}} the nomination process.|$|R
25|$|Three {{different}} candidates won {{the first}} three contests. Santorum, who had been running a one-state campaign in Iowa, narrowly won in that state's caucuses {{by a handful of}} votes over Romney (who was thought to have won <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> before a recount). Romney won New Hampshire, but lost South Carolina to Gingrich. From there, Romney regained his momentum by winning the crucial state of Florida, while Santorum took his campaign national and carried three more states before Super Tuesday, while Romney carried seven states.|$|E
25|$|In the 1972 primary elections, McGovern named Hart his {{national}} campaign director. Along with Rick Stearns, {{an expert on}} the new system, they decided on a strategy to focus on the 28 states holding caucuses instead of primary elections. They felt the nature of <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> made them easier (and less costly) to win if they targeted their efforts. While their primary election strategy proved successful in winning the nomination, McGovern would go on to lose the 1972 presidential election {{in one of the most}} lopsided elections in U.S. history.|$|E
25|$|Paul campaigned {{heavily in}} Nevada, more than Mitt Romney, {{the only other}} {{candidate}} to go there. On January 17, Paul's Nevada campaign representatives warned state GOP officials that thousands of caucus-goers had been given wrong caucus locations. A correction was put onto the Nevada GOP website that morning, two days before <b>the</b> <b>caucuses.</b> Then Paul's campaign criticized inconsistencies, confusion over rules, and a shortage of ballots in some counties. They asked the state Republican Party to consider postponing the vote because of those problems and others, such as unclear rules on who could vote.|$|E

25|$|On December 10, 2011 {{the first}} of two final debates to be {{conducted}} in Iowa before <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> was held, and hosted by ABC News, The Des Moines Register, and the Iowa Republican Party. The debate was the first to occur following Cain's campaign suspension, with Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum participating in the debate. Jon Huntsman, who had refused to contest Iowa, instead focusing his efforts on winning the New Hampshire primary, was not {{invited to participate in the}} debate, and did not meet the debate organizer's criteria of participation.|$|E
25|$|Iowa {{state law}} {{mandates}} that its caucus {{must be held}} at least eight days before any other meeting, caucus, or primary for the presidential nominating process. Therefore, the Iowa Caucuses have always been traditionally the leading state in the nominating process. Not only did controversy brew between the candidates, but <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> themselves drew {{a large amount of}} media attention. The decisions of the Iowans often affect the rest of the campaign season. Barack Obama's victory in Iowa helped establish him as one of the Democratic frontrunners of 2008 and was a first step toward his eventual nomination.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 Republican {{primaries}} the Republican Party of Iowa {{partnered with}} various news {{organizations such as}} Fox News to bring a series of debates that were nationally televised, but directed toward voters in Iowa. This national attention is a potential political boon for a small Midwestern state and attracts attention politically to a state that may otherwise not receive such attention. <b>The</b> <b>caucuses</b> also give power to the party members in the electorate. In this the average GOP voter in Iowa can {{set the tone for}} the entire primary campaign, which gives local voters tremendous control over who the next president will be.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Maine Republican <b>caucuses,</b> 2008 {{were held}} on February 1, February 2, and February 3 at various {{locations}} {{throughout the state}} of Maine. The results were used to apportion 21 delegates for the state. <b>The</b> Maine Republican <b>caucuses</b> were <b>the</b> first <b>caucuses</b> in <b>the</b> 2008 election season in which Rudy Giuliani {{was out of the}} race.|$|R
25|$|While {{this process}} lasts {{for a period}} of {{approximately}} five months, the results of the state caucus are usually predictable by the results of <b>the</b> precincts' <b>caucuses</b> combined. Therefore, <b>the</b> results of <b>the</b> precinct <b>caucuses</b> provide a good measurement of Iowa's delegation to the Democratic National Convention.|$|R

25|$|A {{total of}} 142 {{candidates}} on 53 lists entered the election via the geographical constituencies, {{making it the}} most contested election since the handover of Hong Kong. The candidates of both the pan-democracy and pro-Beijing coalitions stated {{that they would not}} allocate the votes within each camp, leading to infighting inside <b>the</b> <b>caucuses.</b> Martin Lee and Anson Chan announced that they would not stand, and would endorse other candidates. In addition, some incumbent legislators such as Audrey Eu of the Civic Party and Yeung Sum of the Democratic Party were placed second on their lists in an attempt to get less experienced members of their parties elected.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent statewide polling {{then saw}} a surge among several candidates, {{including}} Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul, who would both {{surge in the}} final weeks before <b>the</b> <b>caucuses.</b> On December 3, 2011, in Atlanta, Georgia, Herman Cain officially announced the suspension of his campaign, due to the various allegations of sexual harassment, a 13-year affair, and personal attacks on his family. Soon thereafter {{it was reported that}} Cain would endorse Gingrich the following Monday, but it proved to be untrue, with Cain refusing to endorse any other candidates. Despite the suspension of his campaign, the Republican Party of Iowa will still report caucus vote totals for Cain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} {{weeks leading up to}} <b>the</b> <b>caucuses,</b> a {{majority}} of the candidates spent a large amount of time campaigning in the state, with Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry touring the state on their own respective bus tours. Bachmann visited all 99 of the state's counties in a ten-day sweep through the state. Other candidates, including Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, also held several events throughout the state to meet with voters. Mitt Romney also visited the state, but spent most of December focusing his efforts on the New Hampshire primary instead. Jon Huntsman also decided to focus on the New Hampshire primary, and did not campaign in Iowa.|$|E
50|$|Bernie Sanders {{received}} the most votes and the most delegates in <b>the</b> precinct <b>caucuses.</b> <b>The</b> 2016 turnout was slightly lower than the 2008 tally of 214,066, when Obama won with 142,109 votes, to Clinton's 78,381.|$|R

25|$|In Iowa, {{there were}} 1,784 precincts for <b>the</b> <b>caucuses.</b> Each viable {{preference}} group at each caucus elected {{a certain number}} of delegates proportional to the group's size that would represent the candidate at the county conventions. There are 99 counties in Iowa, and their Democratic conventions took place on March 15, 2008. At these conventions, a subset of delegates were chosen to attend the district, then state conventions. At the Iowa Democratic Party State Convention on June 14, 2008, a subset of delegates were chosen to attend the Democratic National Convention held August 25–28, 2008, in Denver, Colorado. As in the precinct caucuses, the pledged delegates to the national convention proportionally represented the candidates compared to the results of the state caucus.|$|E
25|$|February 9 saw {{voting in}} Louisiana, Kansas and Washington state. Huckabee won an easy victory in Kansas, {{claiming}} all 36 of the state's {{delegates to the}} national convention. Only 14,016 votes were cast, and the McCain campaign expressed no concern over the lightly attended caucus. However, social conservatives had a strong presence in the Kansas Republican party, and the results served to highlight conservative dissatisfaction with the Senator. Louisiana was much closer, but Huckabee won there as well, beating McCain by less than one percentage point. McCain was declared {{the winner of the}} Washington caucuses, where 18 delegates were at stake. The February 19 primary would determine the other 19 delegates from the state. After <b>the</b> <b>caucuses,</b> Huckabee's campaign indicated that they would challenge the results.|$|E
25|$|Five {{days before}} the New Hampshire primary, {{candidates}} competed at caucuses in Iowa. Barack Obama hoped that he would win these primaries {{the same way he}} defeated Hillary Clinton at the Iowa caucuses. Since his victory, he had attracted several supporters, which increased his chances at winning this primary. Likewise, Clinton was struggling to overcome setbacks after she came in third place at <b>the</b> <b>caucuses</b> in Iowa. A series of pre-primary polls showed that Obama enjoyed a significant lead. Clinton was coming second, and John Edwards third. Average polling during the period of January 5 to January 7, 2008 by Real Clear Politics indicated Obama's support at 38.3%, Clinton at 30.0%, Edwards at 18.3%, and Richardson at 5.7%. These results indicated an 8.3% lead for Obama.|$|E
