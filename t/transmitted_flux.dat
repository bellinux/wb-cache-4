40|$|We {{have studied}} the power {{spectrum}} and the intermittent behavior of the fluctuations in the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> of HE 2347 - 4342 Lyα absorption in order to investigate {{if there is any}} discrepancy between the LCDM model with parameters given by the WMAP and observations on small scales. If the non-Gaussianity of cosmic mass field is assumed to come only from halos with an universal mass profile of the LCDM model, the non-Gaussian behavior of mass field would be effectively measured by its intermittency, because intermittency is a basic statistical feature of the cuspy structures. We have shown that the Lyα <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> field of HE 2347 - 4342 is significantly intermittent on small scales. With the hydrodynamic simulation, we demonstrate that the LCDM model is successful in explaining the power spectrum and intermittency of Lyα <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux.</b> Using statistics ranging from the second to eighth order, we find no discrepancy between the LCDM model and the observed <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> field, and no evidence to support the necessity of reducing the power of density perturbations relative to the standard LCDM model up to comoving scales as small as about 0. 08 h^- 1 Mpc. Moreover, our simulation samples show that the intermittent exponent of the Lyα <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> field is probably scale-dependent. This result is different from the prediction of universal mass profile with a constant index of the central cusp. The scale-dependence of the intermittent exponent indicates that the distribution of baryonic gas is decoupled from the underlying dark matter. Comment: 27 pages (incl. 8 figures).

40|$|Abridged] The {{transmission}} of light through a planetary atmosphere {{can be studied}} {{as a function of}} altitude and wavelength using stellar or solar occultations, giving often unique constraints on the atmospheric composition. For exoplanets, a transit yields a limb-integrated, wavelength-dependent transmission spectrum of an atmosphere. When scattering haze and/or cloud particles are present in the planetary atmosphere, the amount of <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> not only depends on the total optical thickness of the slant light path that is probed, but also on the amount of forward-scattering by the scattering particles. Here, we present results of calculations with a three-dimensional Monte Carlo code that simulates the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> during occultations or transits. For isotropically scattering particles, like gas molecules, the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> appears to be well-described by the total atmospheric optical thickness. Strongly forward-scattering particles, however, such as commonly found in atmospheres of Solar System planets, can increase the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> significantly. For exoplanets, such added flux can decrease the apparent radius of the planet by several scale heights, which is comparable to predicted and measured features in exoplanet transit spectra. We performed detailed calculations for Titan's atmosphere between 2. 0 and 2. 8 micron and show that haze and gas abundances will be underestimated by about 8 % if forward-scattering is ignored in the retrievals. At shorter wavelengths, errors in the gas and haze abundances and in the spectral slope of the haze particles can be several tens of percent, also for other Solar System planetary atmospheres. We also find that the contribution of forward-scattering can be fairly well described by modelling the atmosphere as a plane-parallel slab. Comment: Icarus, accepted for publicatio...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a set of}} 28 high resolution, {{high signal}} to noise ratio (S/N) QSO Ly-alpha {{absorption}} spectra, we investigate the non-Gaussian features of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> fluctuations, and their effect upon the power spectrum of this field. We find that the spatial distribution of the local power of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> on scales k >= 0. 05 s/km is highly spiky or intermittent. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the local power are long-tailed. The power on small scales is dominated by small probability events, and consequently, the uncertainty in the power spectrum of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> field is generally large. This uncertainty arises due to the slow convergence of an intermittent field to a Gaussian limit required by the central limit theorem (CLT). To reduce this uncertainty, it is common to estimate the error of the power spectrum by selecting subsamples with an "optimal" size. We show that this conventional method actually does not calculate the variance of the original intermittent field but of a Gaussian field. Based on the analysis of intermittency, we propose an algorithm to calculate the error. It is based on a bootstrap re-sampling among all independent local power modes. This estimation doesn't require any extra parameter like the size of the subsamples, and is sensitive to the intermittency of the fields. This method effectively reduces the uncertainty in the power spectrum when the number of independent modes matches the condition of the CLT convergence. Comment: 26 pages (incl. figures).

40|$|We use {{hydrodynamic}} cosmological simulations in a 9. 6 Mpc box {{to explore}} {{the evolution of the}} intergalactic medium (IGM) transmissivity from z= 2 through the epoch of reionization. Reionization is achieved through an ultraviolet background (UVB) that includes evolving stellar and QSO source populations. We construct and analyze noiseless synthetic HI Lya absorption spectra along lines of sight through our continuously evolving box and find a smooth evolution of the effective optical depth under a power law up to the epoch of reionization. Crossing into the epoch of reionization, both the mean <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> (MTF) and variance to the mean <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> sharply deviate from a smooth evolution and hence such observables have large margins of error. Despite the statistical uncertainty in inferring the reionization profile from spectra, the end of an opacity phase transition of the IGM correlates well with the redshift when both the mean and variance of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> rapidly deviate from the post-reionization profile. However, an unobtainable number of lines of sight is needed to allow an estimate of the MTF with less than 10 % relative margin of error.

We show that this statistic is sensitive to spectral resolution at reionization redshifts, but overall in agreement with results by Songaila and Cowie (2002).

The result of the DFA method applied to both datasets, shows that there exists a difference in the correlation properties between the short and long-range regimes: the slopes of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>flux</b> fluctuation function are different on small and large scales. The scaling exponents, α_ 1 = 1. 635 ± 0. 115 and α_ 2 = 0. 758 ± 0. 085 for the ESI/Keck sample and α_ 1 = 1. 763 ± 0. 128 and α_ 2 = 0. 798 ± 0. 084 for the UVES/VLT sample for the short and long range regime respectively. The transition between the two regims is observed at about ∼ 1. 4 h^- 1 Mpc (comoving). The fact that α_ 1 is always larger than α_ 2 for each spectrum supports the common view that the Universe is smoother on large scales than on small scales.

These flux PDFs are constructed in 3 D as well as in projection (i. e. in 2 D). The PDFs are constructed by relating the lower-order moments, i. e. cumulants and cumulant correlators, of the fluxes to the 3 D neutral hydrogen distribution which is, in turn, expressed as a function of the underlying dark matter distribution. The lower-order moments are next modelled using a generating function formalism in the context of a minimal tree-model for the higher-order correlation hierarchy. These different approximations give nearly identical results for the range of redshifts probed, and we also find a very good agreement between our predictions and outputs of hydrodynamical simulations. The formalism developed here for the joint statistics of flux-decrements concerning two lines of sight can be extended to multiple lines of sight, which could be particularly important for the 3 D reconstruction of the cosmic web from QSO spectra (e. g. in the BOSS survey). These statistics probe the underlying projected neutral hydrogen field and are thus linked to "hot-spots" of absorption. The results for the PDF and the bias presented here use the same functional forms of scaling functions that have previously been employed for the modelling of other cosmological observation such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
