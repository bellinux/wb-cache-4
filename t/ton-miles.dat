25|$|U.S. railroads {{still play}} a major role in the nation's freight shipping. They carried 750 billion <b>ton-miles</b> by 1975 which doubled to 1.5 {{trillion}} <b>ton-miles</b> in 2005. In the 1950s, the U.S. and Europe moved roughly the same percentage of freight by rail; by 2000, the share of U.S. rail freight was 38% while in Europe only 8% of freight traveled by rail. In 2000, while U.S. trains moved 2,390 billion ton-kilometers of freight, the 15-nation European Union moved only 304 billion ton-kilometers of freight. In terms of <b>ton-miles,</b> railroads annually move more than 25% of the United States' freight and connect businesses with each other across the country and with markets overseas.|$|E

25|$|The Port of Huntington-Tristate is {{the largest}} inland port in the United States in terms of total tonnage and <b>ton-miles.</b> This is {{due in large part}} to the coal traffic from the railroads and the {{petroleum}} products produced by the Marathon Petroleum oil refinery in nearby Catlettsburg, Kentucky that use the Port of Huntington/Tri-State to load their products onto barges.|$|E

Over the years, it acquired, merged with or owned part of at least 800 other rail lines and companies. At the end of 1925, it operated 10,515 miles of rail line; in the 1920s, it carried nearly three times the traffic as other railroads of comparable length, such as the Union Pacific or Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroads.

50|$|Blankenbuhler {{replaced}} the Shay locomotives with 40-passenger gasoline-powered railcars for the 1916 season. Some {{of the last}} freight hauled over the 9-miles from Silver Plume to Waldorf was 100,000 pounds (50 tons) of telephone poles, wire, insulators and supplies for Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph {{in the summer of}} 1917. This was for the Argentine Pass segment of a long-distance telephone line from Denver to Leadville. Because the railroad was exclusively a tourist line at this time, all freight had to be hauled at night or early in the morning. The freight charge for this load of telephone supplies was $500, or $1.11 per <b>ton-mile.</b> In contrast, the average freight rate in the United States in 1915 was under $0.008 per <b>ton-mile.</b>|$|R

40|$|Interpreting {{the role}} of {{expanding}} transport in overall production growth {{in the nineteenth century}} is still hampered by our lack of understanding of how much and when ocean shipping costs began to fall. This paper exploits new output and freight rate data for one of the world’s largest merchant fleets, the Norwegian, 1830 – 66. We argue that the price of an average shipped <b>ton-mile</b> was subject to three sources of returns to scale. We test for the impact of a changing composition of produced output (the ‘composition effect’) to account for economies of scope and offer an alternative index for the price of the average <b>ton-mile</b> that shows a strongly falling trend for the entire period. We then turn to the effect that increasing maturity of new routes had on prices, thus analysing returns to an increased network density finding strong evidence for their existence. Finally, we investigate the importance of internal scale economies in firm and ship size based on a cost survey conducted in 1867 – 70. ...|$|R

25|$|Because a horse {{can pull}} a barge {{carrying}} a cargo of over 50 tons {{compared to the}} typical one ton or less hauled by wagon, and the horse required a wagoner versus a couple of men for the barge, water transportation costs were {{a small fraction of}} wagonage costs.

40|$|The Inland Waterway Revenue Act of 1978 (Public Law 95 - 502) {{established}} a barge-fuel tax of four cents per gallon that became effective in October of 1980.

The tax revenue {{is used to}} recover {{part of the cost}} of governmental provision of a navigable river system;This study examines the effects of various taxing methods at rates that are estimated to recover all of the costs of providing an inland waterway system for commercial navigation. Impacts of the alternative waterway user fees on transport modal shares and revenues, relationships between origins and destinations, tax revenue generation, and transport costs of corn, wheat, and soybean haulage in 1985 are projected;A linear programming model that specifies alternative transport mode, crop, origin, destination, and time period combinations is developed. A model solution is that combination which minimizes the total annual cost of transporting and handling grain from U. S. grain-surplus regions to domestic and foreign grain-deficit regions. Six solutions are found under six different user fee scenarios. No user fees exist in one scenario. A fuel tax, <b>ton-mile</b> tax, and a combination of fuel and <b>ton-mile</b> tax are used as three alternative scenarios of user fee imposition. Rail rate increases, in response to a <b>ton-mile</b> tax, are incorporated in the last two scenarios;The solution results indicate that up to 255 million bushels of corn, wheat, and soybeans will be diverted from barge transport to rail and truck after user fees are imposed. Most of this diversion is Iowa- and Minnesota-produced grain. Each crop has around 15 percent of its respective barge traffic diverted when taxes are imposed. Total user fees collected on grain shipments range from 50 million to 61. 2 million and, based on the grain that moves by barge after tax imposition, the tax revenues represent a per bushel average that ranges from 2. 65 to 3. 27 cents...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the use of}} energy by Alaska’s transportation sectors {{to assess the impact}} of sudden fuel prices changes. We conducted three types of analysis: 1) Development of broad energy use statistics for each transportation sector, including total annual energy and fuel use, carbon emissions, fuel use per <b>ton-mile</b> and passenger-mile, and cost of fuel per <b>ton-mile</b> and passenger-mile. 2) Economic input-output analysis of air, rail, truck, and water transportation sectors. 3) Adjustment of input-output modeling to reflect sudden fuel price changes to estimate the potential impact on industry output and employment. Alaska air transportation used approximately 1. 9 billion gallons of fuel annually; 961 million gallons were used for intra-state and exiting Alaska flights. Water transportation used 101. 8 million gallons annually, approximately 84. 3 million gallons for intra-state and exiting segments. Railroad and truck transportation used 5. 1 and 8. 8 million gallons annually, respectively. Simulated fuel price increases resulted in an estimated $ 456. 8 million in value-added losses to the Alaska economy through the increase in cost of transportation services, as well as an equivalent loss in income to Alaska household of $ 26. 8 million. A carbon emissions tax would have the greatest impact on the cost of air transportation services followed by water, trucking and rail...|$|R
