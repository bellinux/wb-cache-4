5|$|Beginning in 1915, Bayer set up {{a number}} of shell {{corporations}} and subsidiaries in the United States, to hedge against the possibility of losing control of its American assets if the U.S. should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets (e.g., army uniforms). After the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917, alien property custodian A. Mitchell Palmer began investigating German-owned businesses, and soon {{turned his attention to}} Bayer. To avoid having to surrender all profits and assets to the government, Bayer's management shifted the stock to a new company, nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German-American Bayer leaders. Palmer, however, soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer's American holdings. After the Trading with the Enemy Act was amended to allow sale of these holdings, the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer's American patents and <b>trademarks,</b> including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo. It was bought by a patent medicine company, Sterling Products, Inc.. The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U.S. rights to the Bayer name and <b>trademarks</b> were sold back to Bayer AG in 1994 for US$1 billion.|$|E

5|$|When Burger King {{expanded}} into the San Antonio area, it was prevented from utilizing the name Whopper in its local advertising and stores {{due to a}} prior state registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger.

50|$|<b>Trademark</b> law {{dates back}} to the age of President Ulysses S. Grant {{starting}} in the late 19th century with the <b>Trademark</b> Act of 1870. The <b>Trademark</b> Act of 1870 was the first <b>trademark</b> act passed in the nation and grounded <b>trademark</b> protection into Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. The act covered many different aspects of <b>trademark</b> law but failed to cover <b>trademark</b> counterfeiting. After much protest from merchants and manufactures around the country, Congress amended the act to make counterfeiting a crime. This however was short lived, as the case U.S. v. Steffens in 1879 ruled that Article One of the Constitution could not serve as a basis of authority and thus making the <b>Trademark</b> Act of 1870 unconstitutional. All <b>trademark</b> acts after the 1870 one, including the 1881 <b>Trademark</b> Act and the 1946 <b>Trademark</b> Act (The Lanham Act), make no mention of the <b>trademark</b> counterfeiting provision of the 1870 act.|$|R

5|$|Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several {{different}} names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal {{in the international}} markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business.

Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global <b>trademarks</b> to protect its investment in the products.|$|E
