5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes <b>that</b> <b>agreement</b> between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

On 12 June 2003, Air France honoured <b>that</b> <b>agreement,</b> donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is {{on display at the}} Smithsonian's Steven F.

5|$|In February 2014, Shelbourne sought court {{approval}} {{to take up}} an offer of up to $135million from Atlas Apartment Holdings intended to underpin the project's emergence from bankruptcy, with a deadline of August 31, 2014 for having a court-approved reorganization plan. At a hearing on March 11, 2014, Shelbourne announced that it had reached agreement on a repayment plan with the project's creditors, including Related Midwest, which had bought up much of the project's debt. Assuming the project finds funding to satisfy <b>that</b> <b>agreement,</b> Atlas said that the building would be built and that Atlas would control the project, but that Kelleher would still be the developer, {{with the intention of}} building the same building planned prior to suspension of construction.|$|E
5|$|The union between Norway and Sweden, {{imposed by}} the Great Powers in 1814, had been under {{considerable}} strain through the 1890s, the chief issue in question being Norway's rights to its own consular service. Nansen, although not by inclination a politician, had spoken out on the issue on several occasions in defence of Norway's interests. It seemed, early in the 20th century <b>that</b> <b>agreement</b> {{between the two countries}} might be possible, but hopes were dashed when negotiations broke down in February 1905. The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by Christian Michelsen, whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but <b>that</b> <b>agreement</b> was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E

25|$|Fellowship – WELS {{teaches that}} churches must agree on all doctrines of Scripture {{before they can}} enjoy any form of {{fellowship}} with each other (Romans 16:17, Ephesians 4:3-6), while the ELCA teaches <b>that</b> <b>agreement</b> on all aspects of doctrine is not necessarily required as a prerequisite for fellowship.

40|$|On June 30, 2015, in United States v. Apple, Inc., the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held <b>that</b> Apple’s <b>agreements</b> {{with five}} {{publishing}} companies violated the Sherman Act. With Apple as a retailer and the publishers as manufacturers, the agreements {{between the two}} groups were vertical. This classification is significant because in 2007 in Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSKS, Inc., the Supreme Court held <b>that</b> all vertical <b>agreements</b> should be analyzed under the rule of reason. Rather than looking at the structure of the agreements, however, the Second Circuit focused on the type of market restraint <b>that</b> the <b>agreements</b> imposed. Because the vertical agreements facilitated a horizontal conspiracy to raise and set ebook prices, the court reasoned <b>that</b> the <b>agreements</b> were per se illegal. This Comment argues that the Second Circuit erred in finding <b>that</b> the <b>agreements</b> were per se illegal. By ignoring the rule of reason analysis, the Second Circuit’s holding prevented Apple from demonstrating the procompetitive justifications for its agreements...|$|R

25|$|Defence {{relations}} between India and the Russian Federation have a historical perspective. The Soviet Union {{was an important}} supplier of defence equipment for several decades, and that relationship was inherited by Russia after the break-up of the Soviet Union. In 1997, Russia and India signed a ten-year agreement for further military-technical cooperation. <b>That</b> <b>agreement</b> encompassed {{a wide range of}} activities, including the purchase of completed weaponry, joint development and production, and joint marketing of armaments and military technologies.|$|E

40|$|This work {{provides}} an empirical investigation of shareholders' agreements signed in Italy {{over the past}} decade. The evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>agreements</b> produce a remarkable reshuffling of voting power (Shapley value) among participants. In particular, the first owner gains much voting power at low levels of ownership concentration, and his gain is decreasing in his ownership stake; the opposite happens for the other participants. In addition, {{the likelihood that a}} supermajority rule is included in an agreement contract is increasing in the first owner's share of equity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>agreements</b> are used to correct situations where the first owner's power is at one of the two extremes: either too low (leading to insufficient monitoring over managers and gridlocks in decision-making) or too high (enabling him to extract large private benefits of control). ...|$|R

The VFA and SAFL had an existing five-year arrangement for annual interstate matches when the council was established, and <b>that</b> <b>agreement</b> {{was allowed to}} stand but could not be renewed without permission; when the SAFL renewed the agreement in 1911, the council issued an ultimatum that the agreement be cancelled or the SAFL would be expelled from the council, and the SAFL acquiesced.|$|E
