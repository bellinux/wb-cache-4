5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E
