The ARAS {{is a collection of}} different nuclei – more than 20 on each side in the upper brainstem, the pons, medulla, and posterior hypothalamus. The nuclei have their own cytoarchitecture and neurochemical identity and act as neuromodulators.

40|$|Brain {{injury and}} {{subsequent}} plasticity of sensory and corticospinal pathways play an integral {{role in determining}} paretic hand function in congenital hemiplegia. There is limited knowledge regarding {{the relationship between the}} disruption of sensorimotor <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways</b> projecting into the primary motor cortex and motor control. This study sought to investigate the relationship between the structural connectivity of motor networks that anatomically link the brain stem with the precentral and postcentral gyri with paretic motor sensory function by using an automated analysis strategy. Magnetic resonance imaging structural connectivity was measured by using high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging, probabilistic tractography, and the anatomic parcellation of high-resolution structural images in 16 children with congenital unilateral periventricular white-matter damage. Connectivity of the corticospinal and corticothalamic pathways was determined by using an asymmetry index {{based on the number of}} streamlines contained within these projections and compared with measures of paretic hand function and bimanual coordination. For cortical development, the volume of the ipsilesional precentral gyrus was significantly reduced. For connectivity measures, the numbers of streamlines in corticospinal tracts and corticothalamic pathways within the ipsilesional hemisphere were decreased compared with the contralesional side. The sensorimotor thalamic projections were more significantly correlated with paretic hand functions than were the corticospinal tracts. These data support the concept that preservation of sensorimotor <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways</b> that directly project into the primary motor cortex has more influence on motor function control of the paretic hand than does preservation of corticospinal tracts...|$|R
40|$|At {{the early}} stages of visual processing, {{information}} is processed by two major <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways</b> encoding brightness increments (ON) and decrements (OFF). Accumulating evidence suggests that these pathways interact and merge as early as in primary visual cortex. Using regular and reverse-phi motion in a rapid adaptation paradigm, we investigated the temporal dynamics of within and across pathway mechanisms for motion processing. When the adaptation duration was short (188 [*]ms), reverse-phi and regular motion led to similar adaptation effects, suggesting that the information from the two pathways are combined efficiently at early-stages of motion processing. However, as the adaption duration was increased to 752 [*]ms, reverse-phi and regular motion showed distinct adaptation effects depending on the test pattern used, either engaging spatiotemporal correlation between the same or opposite contrast polarities. Overall, these findings indicate that spatiotemporal correlation within and across ON-OFF pathways for motion processing can be selectively adapted, and support those models that integrate within and across pathway mechanisms for motion processing...|$|R
40|$|SummaryVisual {{information}} is mediated by two major <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways</b> that signal light decrements (OFF) and increments (ON) in visual scenes, the OFF pathway being {{faster than the}} ON. Here, we demonstrate that this OFF temporal advantage is transferred to visual cortex and has a correlate in human perception. OFF-dominated cortical neurons in cats responded ∼ 3  ms faster to visual stimuli than ON-dominated cortical neurons, and dark-mediated suppression in ON-dominated neurons peaked ∼ 14  ms faster than light-mediated suppression in OFF-dominated neurons. Consistent with the neuronal differences, human observers were 6 – 14  ms faster at detecting darks than lights and better at discriminating dark than light flickers. Neuronal and perceptual differences both vanished if backgrounds were biased toward darks.

40|$|AbstractSkin {{inflammation}} causes innocuous heat {{to become}} painful. This condition, called heat allodynia, {{is a common}} feature of pathological pain states. Here, we show that heat allodynia is functionally and neuroanatomically distinct from normal heat pain. We subtracted positron emission tomography scans obtained during painful heating of normal skin from scans during equally intense but normally innocuous heating of capsaicin-treated skin. This comparison reveals the specific activation of a medial <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway</b> to the frontal lobe during heat allodynia. The results suggest that different central pathways mediate the intensity and certain qualitative aspects of pain.

Recent studies in monkeys [3 - 6] and humans [7 - 12] suggest that influences of spatial attention on visual awareness may reflect top-down influences on excitability of visual cortex. Here we tested this specifically, by providing direct input into human visual cortex via cortical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to produce illusory visual percepts, called phosphenes. We found that a lower TMS intensity was needed to elicit a conscious phosphene when its apparent spatial location was attended, rather than unattended. Our results indicate that spatial attention can enhance visual-cortex excitability, and visual awareness, even when sensory signals from the eye via the <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway</b> are bypassed...|$|E

In this study, we investigate white matter maturation as reflected by changes in anisotropy and white matter density with age. Thirty-four children and adolescents aged 6 [...] 19 years received diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imag-ing scans. Among these, 30 children and adolescents also received high-resolution T 1 -weighed anatomical scans. A linear regression model was used to correlate fractional anisotropy (FA) values with age on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Within the regions that showed significant FA changes with age, a post hoc analysis was performed to investigate white matter density changes. With increasing age, FA values increased in prefrontal regions, in the internal capsule as well as in basal ganglia and <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways,</b> the ventral visual pathways, and the corpus callosum. The posterior limb of the internal capsule, intrathalamic connections, and the corpus callosum showed the most significant overlaps between white matter density and FA changes with age.

40|$|SummaryInput-specific {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) in afferent inputs to the amygdala serves an essential function in {{the acquisition of}} fear memory. Factors underlying input specificity of synaptic modifications implicated in information transfer in fear conditioning pathways remain unclear. Here we show that the strength of naive synapses in two auditory inputs converging on a single neuron in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is only modified when a postsynaptic action potential closely follows a synaptic response. The stronger inhibitory drive in <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway,</b> as compared with cortical input, hampers the induction of LTP at thalamo-amygdala synapses, contributing to the spatial specificity of LTP in convergent inputs. These results indicate that spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity in afferent projections to the LA is both temporarily and spatially asymmetric, thus providing a mechanism for the conditioned stimulus discrimination during fear behavior...|$|E
40|$|N-methyl-D-aspartate {{receptor}} (NMDAR) -dependent long-term depression (LTD) in {{the lateral}} {{nucleus of the}} amygdala (LA) {{is a form of}} synaptic plasticity thought to be a cellular substrate for the extinction of fear memory. The LA receives converging inputs from the sensory thalamus and neocortex that are weakened following fear extinction. Combining field and patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings in mice, we show that a paired-pulse low-frequency stimulation can induce a robust LTD at thalamic and cortical inputs to LA, and we identify different underlying molecular components at these pathways. We show that while LTD depends on NMDARs and activation of the protein phosphatases PP 2 B and PP 1 at both pathways, it requires NR 2 B-containing NMDARs at the <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway,</b> but NR 2 C/D-containing NMDARs at the cortical pathway. LTD appears to be induced postsynaptically at the thalamic input but presynaptically at the cortical input, since postsynaptic calcium chelation and NMDAR blockade prevent thalamic but not cortical LTD. These results highlight distinct molecular features of LTD in LA that may be relevant for traumatic memory and its erasure, and for pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ...|$|E
40|$|Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an {{inherited}} lysosomal storage disease characterised by accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. NPC patients suffer a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype presenting with motor dysfunction, mental retardation and cognitive decline. To examine the onset and progression of neuropathological insults in NPC we have systematically examined the CNS {{of a mouse}} model of NPC 1 (Npc 1 (-/-) mice) {{at different stages of}} the disease course. This revealed a specific spatial and temporal pattern of neuropathology in Npc 1 (-/-) mice, highlighting that sensory <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways</b> are particularly vulnerable to loss of NPC 1 resulting in neurodegeneration in Npc 1 (-/-) mice. Examination of markers of astrocytosis and microglial activation revealed a particularly pronounced reactive gliosis in the thalamus early in the disease, which subsequently also occurred in interconnected cortical laminae at later ages. Our examination of the precise staging of events demonstrate that the relationship between glia and neurons varies between brain regions in Npc 1 (-/-) mice, suggesting that the cues causing glial reactivity may differ between brain regions. In addition, aggregations of pre-synaptic markers are apparent in white matter tracts and the thalamus and are likely to be formed within axonal spheroids. Our data provide a new perspective, revealing a number of events that occur prior to and alongside neuron loss and highlighting that these occur in a pathway dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|In primates, lesions of {{striate cortex}} (V 1) result in scotomas {{in which only}} {{rudimentary}} visual abilities remain. These aspects of vision that survive V 1 lesions {{have been attributed to}} direct <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways</b> to extrastriate areas, including the middle temporal area (MT). However, studies in New World monkeys and humans have questioned this interpretation, suggesting that remnants of V 1 are responsible for both the activation of MT and residual vision. We studied the visual responses of neurons in area MT in New World marmoset monkeys in the weeks after lesions of V 1. The extent of the scotoma in each case was estimated by mapping the receptive fields of cells located near the lesion border and by histological reconstruction. Two response types were observed among the cells located in the part of MT that corresponds, in visuotopic coordinates, to the lesioned part of V 1. Many neurons (62 %) had receptive fields that were displaced relative to their expected location, so that they represented the visual field immediately surrounding the scotoma. This may be a consequence of a process analogous to the reorganization of the V 1 map after retinal lesions. However, another 20 % of the cells had receptive fields centered inside the scotoma. Most of these neurons were strongly direction-selective, similar to normal MT cells. These results show that MT cells differ in their responses to lesioning of V 1 and that only a subpopulation of MT neurons can be reasonably linked to residual vision and blindsight...|$|R

40|$|Pain subserves {{different}} functions. Acute {{pain from}} the intact body alerts the victim to immediately react and {{withdraw from the}} bodily threat, ideally before an injury happens. However, during manifest injury and tissue inflammation, withdrawal and flight are no longer adaptive. Instead, sparing the affected body part to promote healing requires heightened awareness and avoidance behaviour over longer periods of time. Quality and time scales of behavioural adaptations are therefore substantially different between pain during normal compared to abnormal tissue states. Given these functional differences we postulated that the two phenomena also recruit different forebrain systems. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and subtracted scans obtained during painful heating of normal skin from scans during equally intense but normally non‐painful heating of capsaicin‐treated skin. This comparison reveals the specific activation of a medial <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway</b> to limbic forebrain structures such as anterior insula, perigenual anterior cingulate, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex during pain originating in the chemically sensitised skin. It {{is possible that the}} unique forebrain recruitment by pain under a patho‐physiological tissue status is caused by a significantly greater facilitation of the multi‐synaptic projections from the spino‐parabrachial tract of the superficial dorsal horn to the medial thalamus compared to deeper and direct lateral thalamic projections from the spino‐thalamic tract...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe upper {{brainstem}} {{is known}} to participate in brain activation, since the pioneering description of the Ascending Reticular System {{in the middle of}} twentieth century. Since the early works, waking state and paradoxical sleep were considered to be implicated in the same circuitry of activation. The consciousness cognitive process, which develops within a global cerebral workspace, and is directly linked with the waking state, is modulated by neurotransmitters, the most emblematic and historic being: amino acids, such as glutamate (excitatory), gamma-aminobutyric acid (inhibitory); monoamines, such as serotonin and noradrenaline; and acetylcholine. From animal research, the main thalamic and extra-thalamic pathways, originating from the tegmentum, were early precisely described. These two pathways are nowadays admitted in human, supporting the cortical activation from the deep brain. The superior cholinergic <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway</b> originates within dorsolateral tegmental nuclei, and notably the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the small laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, innervating the whole thalamus. The inferior, serotoninergic-noradrenergic basal-forebrain pathway, or extrathalamic, originates within the dorsal mesencephalon-pontine area, specifically the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe and central superior nuclei. Schematically, the thalamic and extra-thalamic pathways reach the hemispheric cortices, respectively through the thalamus and the hypothalamus. During several pathologic conditions, alterations of this deep brain circuitry lead to disorders of consciousness, but the detailed mechanisms of dysfunctions are still not deciphered...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanisms}} of decision-making are generally {{thought to be}} under the control of a set of cortico-subcortical loops involving basal ganglia and <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathways.</b> These structures include several parallel functional loops connecting back to distinct areas of cortex, processing motor, cognitive and limbic modalities of decision making. Due to convergence and divergence within the network, these loops cannot be completely segregated. We used these circuit properties to develop a computational model at a spiking neuron level of description. The model was implemented using leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal models connected by voltage-jump synapses and its architecture relied on commonly accepted data regarding the complex functional connectivity description between basal ganglia, cortex and thalamus. This model was applied to a decision making task which was initially studied in primates. In this task, the animals were trained to associate reward probabilities to different cues they had to select in order to maximize their gain. Combining behavioral and electrophysiological experimental data from this study and detailed circuit description, we developed a basal ganglia model in which we used two parallel loops, each of which performed decision making based on interactions between positive and negative feedback pathways. The loops communicate via partially convergent and divergent connections in specific basal ganglia sub-regions. This neuronal network model was then trained to perform the same decision making task as in primates. This training resulted from the closed-loop interaction between the neural circuitry and its sensory-motor interface. The learning was implemented as a cortico-striatal synaptic weight variation modulated by phasic dopamine release following {{the presence or absence of}} reward delivery. Thanks to this simple bottom-up approach the model was able to learn to select optimum reward cues in a similar manner as the monkey. Moreover, this model allows us (i) to avoid the arbitrary choice of a pre-existing machine-learning derivative model, (ii) to investigate lesional and pharmacological effects on learning and decision making and (iii) also provides the possibility to test for further hypotheses regarding cell-scale mechanisms effect on the whole model capacities...|$|R

An MRI-compatible stimulation electrode was implanted in the VP or MT of α-chloralose-anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation was applied to the VP or MT at various intensities (50 µA to 300 µA) and frequencies (1 Hz to 12 Hz). BOLD responses were analyzed in the ipsilateral forelimb region of the primary somatosensory cortex (iS 1 FL) after VP stimulation and in the ipsilateral cingulate cortex (iCC) after MT stimulation. When stimulating the VP, the strongest activation occurred at 3 Hz. The stimulation intensity threshold was 50 µA and the response rapidly peaked at 100 µA. When stimulating the MT, The optimal frequency for stimulation was 9 Hz or 12 Hz, the stimulation intensity threshold was 100 µA and we observed a graded increase in the BOLD response following the application of higher intensity stimuli. We also evaluated c-Fos expression following the application of a 200 -µA stimulus. Ventroposterior thalamic stimulation elicited c-Fos-positivity in few cells in the iS 1 FL and caudate putamen (iCPu). Medial thalamic stimulation, however, produced numerous c-Fos-positive cells in the iCC and iCPu.

Twelve animals served as surgical controls. Only the fornical and medial prefrontal lesions disrupted DNMP performance, both groups showing a loss of accuracy {{and an increase in}} bias. The rats were then trained on a lever discrimination and reversal task, the medial prefrontal and fornical groups showing evidence of an increase in bias when compared with the cingulate cortex group. Finally, the rats were trained on a forced alternation task in a T- maze. Marked deficits were observed in the fornix and cingulum bundle groups, but the medial prefrontal and cingulate groups were unimpaired. The double dissociation between the effects of the prefrontal and cingulum bundle lesions highlights the very different nature of the two spatial tasks (DNMP and T-maze alternation), even though both involved a nonmatching rule. These findings may reflect the involvement of divergent outputs from the fornix-anterior <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway.</b> One possibility is that anterior thalamic projections to the medial prefrontal cortex are concerned with processing egocentric information, while anterior thalamic projections to temporal regions via the cingulum bundle are concerned with allocentric information.

40|$|International audiencePre-processed motion {{information}} {{has been reported to}} trigger active exploration responses (tracking, pursuit) or the opposite (avoidance) (1, 2). Two thalamic information flows (the Magno and Koniocellular pathways) carry this information, directly to the superior colliculus for rapid reaction and via the cortex where they are integrated. The former <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway</b> has been broadly studied, whilst the latter lacks understanding. To address this question, we study the responses to motion information in a reduced bio-inspired computational model (10), emulating the thalamo-cortico-collicular visual system of mammals. This model integrates knowledge about the properties of both pathways (6) and is based on known projections between these structures (4, 8). Its cortical and collicular maps are implemented with Dynamic Neural Fields (DNF) (7). We study how from such local operators emerge decisions corresponding to complex behaviors (9), such as to approach or to flee. The analysis of the responses of the model to image sequences, resulting from the interplay between the dynamics of the DNFs, yields interesting phenomena. Thanks to the Konio pathway (3), providing raw information about the identity of the stimulus (threat/target), the superior colliculus may choose the upcoming behavior (to flee in presence of a threat), while the cortical mechanisms modulate this rudimentary sensory-motor loop. Such detection is based on two functional interacting ingredients: 1) The capability of the retina to provide coarse, rapid visual event detection (e. g. a looming motion expected to correspond to an approaching target), thus a-priori "assumptions" about the visual surroundings. 2) The algorithmic capability of dual kinds of connectivity of the thalamic neurons (precise/diffuse connectivity standing for core/matrix (5)) to treat, in sequence, different perceptual hypotheses. Our modeling and related numerical experiments demonstrate the functionality of such dual mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Learning {{and memory}} depend on {{signaling}} mole- cules that affect synaptic efficacy. The cytoskeleton has {{been implicated in}} regulating synaptic transmission but its role in learning and memory is poorly understood. Fear learning depends on plasticity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. We therefore examined whether the cytoskeletal-regulatory protein, myosin light chain kinase, might contribute to fear learning in the rat lateral amygdala. Microinjection of ML- 7, a specific inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala before fear conditioning, but not immediately afterward, enhanced both short-term memory and long-term memory, suggesting that myosin light chain kinase is involved specifically in memory acquisition rather than in posttraining consolidation of memory. Myosin light chain kinase inhibitor {{had no effect on}} memory retrieval. Furthermore, ML- 7 had no effect on behavior when the train- ing stimuli were presented in a non-associative manner. An- atomical studies showed that myosin light chain kinase is present in cells throughout lateral nucleus of the amygdala and is localized to dendritic shafts and spines that are postsynaptic to the projections from the auditory thalamus to lateral nucleus of the amygdala, a pathway specifically impli- cated in fear learning. Inhibition of myosin light chain kinase enhanced long-term potentiation, a physiological model of learning, in the auditory <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway</b> to the lateral nu- cleus of the amygdala. When ML- 7 was applied without as- sociative tetanic stimulation it had no effect on synaptic responses in lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Thus, myosin light chain kinase activity in lateral nucleus of the amygdala appears to normally suppress synaptic plasticity in the cir- cuits underlying fear learning, suggesting that myosin light chain kinase may help prevent the acquisition of irrelevant fears. Impairment of this mechanism could contribute to pathological fear learning...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequent}} jumps of the eyeballs—called saccades—imply {{the need}} for a constant correction of motor errors. If systematic errors are detected in saccade landing, the saccade amplitude adapts to compensate for the error. In the laboratory, saccade adaptation can be studied by displacing the saccade target. Functional selectivity of adaptation for different saccade types suggests that adaptation occurs at multiple sites in the oculomotor system. Saccade motor learning might be the result of a comparison between a prediction of the saccade landing position and its actual postsaccadic location. To investigate whether a <b>thalamic</b> feedback <b>pathway</b> might carry such a prediction signal, we studied a patient with a lesion in the posterior ventrolateral thalamic nucleus. Saccade adaptation was tested for reactive saccades, which are performed to suddenly appearing targets, and for scanning saccades, which are performed to stationary targets. For reactive saccades, we found a clear impairment in adaptation retention ipsilateral to the lesioned side and a larger-than-normal adaptation on the contralesional side. For scanning saccades, adaptation was intact on both sides and not different from the control group. Our results provide the first lesion evidence that adaptation of reactive and scanning saccades relies on distinct feedback pathways from cerebellum to cortex. They further demonstrate that saccade adaptation in humans is not restricted to the cerebellum but also involves cortical areas. The paradoxically strong adaptation for outward target steps can be explained by stronger reliance on visual targeting errors when prediction error signaling is impaired...|$|R

40|$|Unilateral visual neglect is {{commonly}} defined as impaired ability {{to attend to}} stimuli presented {{on the side of}} visual space contralateral to the brain lesion. However, behavioral analyses indicate that different neglect symptoms can dissociate. The neuroanatomy of the syndrome has been hotly debated. Some groups have argued that the syndrome is linked to posterior parietal cortex lesions, while others report damage within regions including the superior temporal gyrus, insula, and basal ganglia. Several recent neuroimaging studies provide evidence that heterogeneity in the behavioral symptoms of neglect can be matched by variations in the brain lesions, and that some of the discrepancies across earlier findings might have resulted from the use of different neuropsychological tests and/or varied measures within the same task for diagnosing neglect. In this paper, we review the evidence for dissociations between both the symptoms and the neural substrates of unilateral visual neglect, drawing on ALE (anatomic likelihood estimation) meta-analyses of lesion-symptom mapping studies. Specifically, we examine dissociations between neglect symptoms associated with impaired control of attention across space (in an egocentric frame of reference) and within objects (in an allocentric frame of reference). Results of ALE meta-analyses indicated that, while egocentric symptoms are associated with damage within perisylvian network (pre- and postcentral, supramarginal, and superior temporal gyri) and damage within sub-cortical structures, more posterior lesions including the angular, middle temporal, and middle occipital gyri are associated with allocentric symptoms. Furthermore, there was high concurrence in deficits associated with white matter lesions within long association (superior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital, and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) and projection (corona radiata and <b>thalamic</b> radiation) <b>pathways,</b> supporting a disconnection account of the syndrome. Using this evidence we argue that different forms of neglect link to both distinct and common patterns of gray and white matter lesions. The findings are discussed in terms of functional accounts of neglect and theoretical models based on computational studies of both normal and impaired attention functions. © 2012 Chechlacz, Rotshtein and Humphreys...|$|R
40|$|Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is {{considered}} as an ubiquitous rule for associative plasticity in cortical networks in vitro.

We propose the existence of a correlation-based threshold in vivo, limiting the expression of STDP-induced changes outside the critical period, and which accounts for the stability of synaptic weights during sensory cortical processing in the absence of attention or reward-gated supervision...|$|E
40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are a {{collection}} of sub-cortical nuclei involved in the execution {{of a range of}} motor and cognitive behaviours. The striatum is the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, receiving major excitatory innervation from the cerebral cortex and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. The main target of these two pathways are the principal striatal neurons, the medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), which are subdivided based on their axonal targets and the expression of molecular markers. Direct pathway neurons project to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia and express the D dopamine receptor subtype, whereas indirect pathway MSNs project to the output nuclei via the globus pallidus, and express the D receptor. The striatum also contains interneurons that are essential in processing information within striatum; the cholinergic interneuron is of particular interest due to its role in reward-related behaviour. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the cortical and thalamic innervation of subtypes of striatal neurons. To examine whether the cortical or thalamic afferents selectively innervate direct or indirect pathway neurons, transgenic mice expressing GFP under either the D or D receptor promoter were used. Striatal sections from these mice were immunostained to reveal the GFP and selective markers of the cortical and thalamic afferents, VGluT 1 and VGluT 2, respectively. A quantitative electron microscopic examination of synaptic connectivity was carried out. The results indicate that there is no selectivity of either the cortical or <b>thalamic</b> <b>pathway</b> for D or D expressing MSNs. Thus both direct and indirect pathway MSNs are involved in the processing of both cortical and thalamic information. The cortical and thalamic innervation to cholinergic interneurons was also examined. Stimulation of cortex and thalamus in vivo in anaesthetised rats resulted in short-latency excitatory responses in identified cholinergic interneurons, indicative of monosynaptic connections. After recording, cholinergic interneurons were filled with neurobiotin. The synaptic innervation from cortex and thalamus was then examined in two individual, electrophysiologically characterised, and neurochemically identified cholinergic interneurons. One neuron received input from both cortex and thalamus, whereas the other neuron received input from the thalamus only. These results provide anatomical and physiological data illustrating how the excitatory inputs to striatum innervate cholinergic interneurons. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the medial}} prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is classically defined by its {{reciprocal}} {{connections with the}} mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), the nature of information transfer between MD and mPFC is poorly understood. In sensory thalamocortical <b>pathways,</b> <b>thalamic</b> recruitment of feedforward inhibition mediated by fast-spiking, putative parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons is a key feature that enables cortical neurons to represent sensory stimuli with high temporal fidelity. Whether a similar circuit mechanism is {{in place for the}} projection from the MD (a higher-order thalamic nucleus that does not receive direct input from the periphery) to the mPFC is unknown. Here we show in mice that inputs from the MD drive disynaptic feedforward inhibition in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) subregion of the mPFC. In particular, we demonstrate that axons arising from MD neurons directly synapse onto and excite PV interneurons that in turn mediate feedforward inhibition of pyramidal neurons in layer 3 of the dACC. This feedforward inhibition in the dACC limits the time window during which pyramidal neurons integrate excitatory synaptic inputs and fire action potentials, but in a manner that allows for greater flexibility than in sensory cortex. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the role of MD-PFC circuit function in cognition...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} we re-examine {{the concept of}} a {{cortical}} column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4 C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback <b>pathways.</b> <b>Thalamic</b> inputs provide the highcontrast receptive field sizes of the column’s neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses...|$|R
40|$|Sensory inputs {{from the}} {{whiskers}} reach the primary somatosensory thalamus through the medial lemniscus tract. The main {{role of the}} thalamus is to relay these sensory inputs to the neocortex according to the regulations dictated by behavioural state. Intracellular recordings in urethane-anaesthetized rats show that whisker stimulation evokes EPSP-IPSP sequences in thalamic neurons. Both EPSPs and IPSPs depress with repetitive whisker stimulation at frequencies above 2 Hz. Single-unit recordings reveal that during quiescent states thalamic responses to repetitive whisker stimulation are suppressed at frequencies above 2 Hz, so that only low-frequency sensory stimulation is relayed to the neocortex. In contrast, during activated states, induced by stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation or application of acetylcholine in the thalamus, high-frequency whisker stimulation at up to 40 Hz is relayed to the neocortex. Sensory suppression {{is caused by the}} depression of lemniscal EPSPs in relatively hyperpolarized thalamocortical neurons. Sensory suppression is abolished during activated states because thalamocortical neurons depolarize and the depressed lemniscal EPSPs are able to reach firing threshold. Strong IPSPs may also contribute to sensory suppression by hyperpolarizing thalamocortical neurons, but during activated states IPSPs are strongly reduced altogether. The results indicate that the synaptic depression of lemniscal EPSPs and the level of depolarization of thalamocortical neurons work together in <b>thalamic</b> primary sensory <b>pathways</b> to suppress high-frequency sensory inputs during non-activated (quiescent) states while permitting the faithful relay of high-frequency sensory information during activated (processing) states...|$|R
