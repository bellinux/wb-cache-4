5|$|At Hogwarts, the first-years are {{assigned}} by the magical Sorting Hat to houses that best suit their personalities. While Harry is being sorted, the Hat suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> placed into Slytherin which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, but when Harry objects, the Hat sends him to Gryffindor. Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family before him.|$|E
5|$|Blackman's {{guilty verdict}} {{led to a}} showing of {{public support for the}} Marine, with people {{creating}} social media groups and online petitions alternately asking <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> given a lenient sentence and calling for his release. The Daily Telegraph supported one Change.org petition for leniency.|$|E

5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of Cowling, Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> buried in such a manner that no one would know exactly where he was buried.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been a fan}} of Kōji Yakusho's acting, Miike made it a {{priority}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> cast in the leading role. In addition, he sought younger actors to play the assassins, in particular Sousuke Takaoka and Takayuki Yamada, with whom Miike had worked in his two films, Crows Zero (2007) and its sequel Crows Zero 2 (2009). The film's screenplay was written by Daisuke Tengan, who had also written the screenplay for Miike's film Audition (1999).|$|E

2500|$|Escrivá's canonization {{attracted}} {{an unusual}} {{amount of attention}} and criticism, both within the Catholic Church and by the press. Father Capucci, the postulator of Escrivá's cause for sainthood, summarized the main accusations against Escrivá: that [...] "he had a bad temper, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> cruel, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> vain, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> close to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pro-Nazi and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so dismayed by the Second Vatican Council <b>that</b> <b>he</b> even travelled to Greece with the idea <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might convert to the Orthodox religion".|$|R

5|$|In May 1947 {{the artistic}} {{collaboration}} between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument.

That same month, Hergé broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.|$|E

5|$|Reitz's {{policies}} were appreciated by the Volksraad, reflecting {{the change in}} the mood of the Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism. Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz's candidature with a vote of forty-three against eighteen. Reitz accepted the endorsement on the condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.|$|E

5|$|Some of Wallace's friends {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> {{buried in}} Westminster Abbey, {{but his wife}} followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at Broadstone, Dorset. Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.|$|E

5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E

5|$|At {{his death}} Gov. Belcher left {{instructions}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> buried with his ardent friend and cousin, Judge Jonathan Remington (1667-1745, father-in-law of William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence). The body of Judge Jonathan Remington was disinterred and placed by his side. The monument which the governor had directed {{to be raised}} over his resting-place was never erected. The tomb became the family vault of Jennisons (Gov. Belcher's granddaughter married Dr. Timothy Lindall Jennison). The site of their grave was forgotten and long search has been made for it. In the late 1800s, local historians found that Gov. Jonathan Belcher and Judge Jonathan Remington were buried in one grave in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Ma. Their tomb is contiguous to that of Judge Edmund Trowbridge and Edmund Trowbridge Dana. In that of Judge Trowbridge rest the remains of Washington Allston; of Chief Justice Francis Dana; of the poet Richard Henry Dana and others of the family.|$|E
5|$|Bird entered {{politics}} in 1981. Three {{years later he}} was elected to the House of Representatives and became Minister of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As minister, Bird conducted a purchase deal for Dominican water before being made Minister of Public Works and Communications on 1 January 1987. In this role, he oversaw the reconstruction of V. C. Bird International Airport, which was the subject of controversy after it was discovered that he had granted a contract for the construction of a new runway to a company in which he was a shareholder. This led to conflict within the ALP, but Bird remained a minister. He was later fired after a scandal in which Israeli weapons, sold to Antigua and Barbuda, were found in the hands of the Medellín Cartel of Colombian drug smugglers – it was discovered that the weapons had been transferred at Bird's instruction, and a report by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper recommended <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> prohibited from holding public office again.|$|E
5|$|Calls by the {{legislature}} for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared his willingness to resign on the condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> allowed to choose his successor. Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next {{in line for the}} governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as his successor, so Fisk resigned as speaker and the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, and Robinson assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term.|$|E

5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, a {{few days}} later, Lobat de Bohan was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} General and Nansouty again took provisional command of the regiment. When General Alexandre de Beauharnais took command of the Army of the Rhine, he directed his troops towards Mainz. Some fighting took place near Landau and the 9th Cavalry charged several times. Just after this event, the commander of the 2nd Squadron of the regiment invoked the provision of an equivocal new law, demanding <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> given command of the regiment instead of Nansouty. His request was rejected and Nansouty's provisional command was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E
