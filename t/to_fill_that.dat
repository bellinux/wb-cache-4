To replace Gilmore, Cincinnati promoted special teams coach Mike Elston, who assumed assistant coaching and defensive line duties. In February, Cincinnati defensive coordinator Joe Tresey was fired by the school. He subsequently {{was hired by the}} University of South Florida <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> school's vacant defensive coordinator position. Replacing Tresey is Virginia defensive coordinator Bob Diaco.|$|E

5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front of}} 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E
5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Michael Langham became artistic {{director}} and produced classic plays including Oedipus Rex, Love's Labour's Lost, She Stoops to Conquer, and A Streetcar Named Desire. After Langham left in 1977, the Guthrie crossed a milestone of sorts when {{for the first}} time it selected an {{artistic director}} that was not a respected collaborator or friend of Tyrone Guthrie.

25|$|A new {{workshop}} at Bjørnevatn {{was completed in}} 1973 and the following year a new silo opened at Bjørnevatn, which also allowed for separating out ore with low iron content. Construction of a second pellets facility started in 1972 and was opened on 4 September 1974. This allowed the company's entire production to switch to pellets. Because the two pellets plants used a combined 20,000 tonnes of bentonite each year, a new import dock was built. The pellets production required increased freshwater access. This was fetched from Førstevatn, and <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> lake, water was pumped from Svartakslavannet.|$|E
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries are allocating significant resources to expanding technology access in schools. Whether these investments will translate into measurable educational improvements {{remains an open question}} because of the limited evidence available. This paper contributes <b>to</b> <b>filling</b> <b>that</b> gap by exploiting a large-scale public program that increased computer and Internet access in secondary public schools in Peru. Rich longitudinal school-level data from 2001 to 2006 are used to implement a differences-in-differences framework. Results indicate no statistically significant effects of increasing technology access in schools on repetition, dropout and initial enrollment. Large sample sizes allow ruling out even modest effects. ...|$|R

25|$|Harlequin {{had also}} failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers {{appreciated}} novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with Amii Lorin's The Tawny Gold Man, becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30 million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90–100% sellout rate each month.|$|E
25|$|The Speaker must {{be elected}} when Parliament first meets after any general election, before it {{proceeds}} {{to deal with}} any other business.

The Speaker may be elected from among the MPs who are not Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, but even a person who is not an MP can be chosen. Nonetheless, a candidate who is not an MP must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP. The Speaker's salary may not be reduced while he is in office.|$|E
25|$|Against this context, {{and at the}} {{instigation}} of {{his brother}} White Kennett and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Basil Kennett was in 1706 appointed chaplain to the British factory at Leghorn, being the first <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> office, and received the degree of B.D. by decree of convocation. The suggestion is made that he took up the post with some reluctance. He was at first much harassed by the Inquisition - the Roman Catholic Church's institutions dedicated against heresy - and had to seek {{the intervention of the}} English government, which promised military reprisals for any 'molestation given to her chaplain'. Ill-health, caused by the climate and his dislike of exercise, obliged him to resign, and he preached for the last time on 8 January 1712–13. He returned home by way of Florence, Rome, and Naples, and through France, collecting books, sculpture, and curiosities. He resumed residence at Corpus Christi in 1714, became D.D., and during the same year was elected president of his college, although he was ‘even then very sickly.’ He died of fever on 3 January 1714–15, and was buried in the college chapel.|$|E

25|$|Delays and {{failures}} in the Granite programme and the abandonment of Green Bamboo without a test, left {{a gap in the}} programme and an emergency capability weapon <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> gap was devised from elements of both Green Bamboo and Orange Herald; being known as Knobkerry, or Green Grass, and the Interim Megaton Weapon. There were also other factors involved in the decision to build an Interim Megaton Weapon. One being that the UK HEU production programme was by 1957 producing quantities of HEU for which there was no immediate need; and the Chiefs of Staff were reluctant to see it continue to languish in stores, unused for weapons, when it was being produced at great cost. The Green Grass warhead containing perhaps 70–86kg of HEU (although there are no reliable declassified sources for this figure) was therefore hurriedly produced and installed in a modified Blue Danube casing, to be known as Violet Club, until a better solution based on the Yellow Sun casing could be produced, known then with Green Grass installed, as Yellow Sun Mk.1. Only five Violet Club weapons were produced, known by the RAF description of Bomb, Aircraft, HE 9,000lb HC, and they were stripped of their Green Grass warheads for transfer to the better casings when these became available.|$|E
25|$|In April 1976, Spurrier {{was sent}} to the {{expansion}} Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two players and a second round draft pick as part of the new franchise's first trade. The Buccaneers' new acquisition generated local excitement, as Spurrier had been a college star at the nearby University of Florida. He won the job as team's first starting quarterback, a position that he later regretted as the undermanned Bucs went on to suffer the first winless season (0-14) in modern NFL history. Though he had looked forward to playing professional football in Florida, Spurrier was frustrated by losing, the constant hits playing behind a porous offensive line, and his philosophical differences with Bucs coach John McKay. McKay insisted on employing a run-heavy attack similar to the offense he had used to win championships at The University of Southern California, while Spurrier felt that the team did not have the right personnel to run the ball effectively and should open up the offense. Another point of contention was Coach McKay's insistence that his son, John McKay, Jr., be the Buc's primary wide receiver while Spurrier and other observers felt {{that he did not have}} the talent <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> role.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{magazines}} named Sports Illustrated {{before the current}} magazine began on August 16, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created Sports Illustrated with a target market for the sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine was a life magazine size and focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released Sports Illustrated in 1949 and this version lasted 6 issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against Sport and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly {{and they did not}} cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that Time patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>that</b> gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter. A number of advisers to Luce, including Life magazine's Ernest Havemann, tried to kill the idea, but Luce, who was not a sports fan, decided the time was right.|$|E

Using questionnaire and interviews, the article examines the health benefits of singing in terms of emotional, psychological, social and physical wellbeing. It concludes that the mixed chorus has a great impact on the total health of the participants.
