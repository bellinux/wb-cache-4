5|$|As Prince of Wales, George Augustus {{bore the}} royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent. The arms {{included}} the royal crest and supporters {{but with the}} single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label. His arms followed {{the change in the}} royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>quarter</b> was dropped altogether. The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to {{form that}} of Great Britain; this was {{reflected}} by impaling their {{arms in a}} single quarter. The claim to the French throne continued, albeit passively, until it was mooted by the French Revolution {{and the formation of}} the French First Republic in 1792. During the peace negotiations at the Conference of Lille, from July to November 1797, the French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace. The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Under King George III of the United Kingdom, a proclamation of 1 January 1801 set the royal style and titles and modified the Royal Arms, removing <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>quarter</b> and putting the arms of England, Scotland and Ireland on the same structural level, with the dynastic arms of Hanover moved to an inescutcheon.|$|E
5000|$|However, New Orleans has {{suffered}} from the same problems with sinking property values and urban decline as other major cities.

5|$|The sex scene {{involving}} Rourke and Bonet {{was filmed}} {{in one of}} the unused buildings located on Royal Street and took four hours to shoot. Parker limited the crew down to himself, cinematographer Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts and the camera assistant. To make the actors more comfortable, Parker played music during the shoot. Production then moved to a corner of New Orleans, which doubled for flashback sequences set in 1943 Times Square, New York. The crew then discovered an unused bus depot, which was used to film scenes set in Ethan Krusemark's gumbo hut. Filming then moved to the St. Alphonsus Church, where the crew filmed a dialogue scene between Angel and Cyphre. Production returned to Royal Street in <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Quarter,</b> where the final confrontation between Angel and Cyphre, and the film's ending were shot.|$|E

25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Quarter,</b> but it was hardly the only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Quarter.</b> The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Quarter</b> or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} parts of the city {{developed}} before the late 19th century, and on higher land predating New Orleans' levee systems, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Quarter</b> remained substantially dry following Hurricane Katrina. Its elevation is five feet (1.5 m) above sea level. Some streets had minor flooding, and several buildings suffered significant wind damage. Most of the major landmarks suffered only minor damage.

This thesis examines public sector incentives and tools to determine their ability to catalyze private sector rehabilitation of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Quarter’s</b> low-rise historic buildings. A list of extant incentives and tools were compiled and tested using two hypothetical projects, each representing a different type of common <b>French</b> <b>Quarter</b> building typology. <b>The</b> goals of this financial analysis were to determine which incentives provided the greatest monetary impact and whether or not the impact was sufficient to motivate the private sector to undertake the project. The analysis determined that state and federal historic tax credits were the most effective incentives, but that they were not adequate to spur a significant amount of rehabilitation activity on <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Quarter’s</b> low-rise buildings. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on both federal and state historic tax credits to determine the appropriate tax credit rate. The analysis determined that combined tax credit rate of up to 90 % of Qualified Rehabilitation Expenditures was necessary to achieve the necessary unleveraged yield for real estate developers to undertake these small-scale rehabilitation projects. Other recommendations included the adoption of tiered tax credi...|$|R
