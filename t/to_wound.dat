5|$|Jeff Glaser, a local {{technician}} {{armed with}} a FLIR device, joins Fazekas, Mulder, and Scully on {{a search for the}} creature. They soon spot two creatures on the FLIR which travel in separate directions, causing the four to split up. Fazekas is attacked and disappears. Mulder deduces from this that the creatures {{may be related to the}} Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. After a brief encounter with the creatures, Glaser takes off running and is swiftly killed by a creature. Mulder is grabbed by the other creature, though it releases him after Scully manages <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> it with her firearm.|$|E
5|$|Desperately {{trying to}} figure out a {{connection}} between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must have seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employees that match their profile information have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen to shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the second}} series, Tom starts a brief {{relationship}} with Vicky Westbrook (Natasha Little), which he ends due to her behaviour after an EERIE (Extreme Emergency Response Initiative Exercise) in the fifth episode. In the following episode, Vicky retaliates by posting his phone number in Soho telephone boxes and clubs, garnering him unwanted attention. While Tom has Sam Buxton (Shauna Macdonald) find and destroy every leaflet, CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds) makes Vicky stop the harassment. At {{the end of the}} episode, he starts a relationship with Dale, which superior Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) disapproves of, demanding that he end it. In later episodes, a shift in consciousness starts to interfere with Tom's work, such as when he goes undercover to stop a renegade British Army major. In the series two finale, he learns from Dale that an American assassin, Mickey Karharias, is visiting the UK. It is later revealed Karharias was actually killed, and the entire operation was orchestrated by supposedly dead CIA agent Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana), who is seeking revenge on Tom for ruining his daughter's life when Tom recruited her. Joyce frames Tom for assassinating the Chief of the Defence Staff. While Tom attempts to prove his innocence, Harry corners him, forcing Tom <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> Harry and escape into the North Sea. At the end of the episode, the team assumes he drowned.|$|E
5|$|The {{boxes are}} found to have been bought with bogus names and cash 23 years ago. Raul's amputated forearm is {{examined}} and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these are after effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul {{from one of his}} old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit boxes are his. Walter tries to remember what he put in the boxes and where the next two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> and capture one of the men.|$|E

25|$|Timing is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> healing. Critically, {{the timing of}} wound reepithelialization can decide {{the outcome of the}} healing.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of broadheads used by hunters: The fixed-blade and the {{mechanical}} types. While the fixed-blade broadhead keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broadhead at all times, the mechanical broadhead deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> the target. The mechanical head flies better {{because it is more}} streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades.|$|E
25|$|Both in vivo {{study and}} {{modelling}} are necessary tools {{to understand this}} complex process. Vascular remodelling is pertinent <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> healing and proper integration of tissue grafts and organ donations. Promoting an active remodelling process in some cases could help patients recover faster and retain functional use of donated tissues. However, outside of wound healing, chronic vascular remodelling in the adult is often symptomatic of cardiovascular disease. Thus, increased understanding of this biomedical phenomenon could aid {{in the development of}} therapeutics or preventative measures to combat diseases such as atherosclerosis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Wound healing succeeds tissue destruction. We {{hypothesized}} that antibodies might bind <b>to</b> <b>wounded</b> tissues, which would facilitate the engulfment of damaged tissues by macrophages. We detected the autoantibodies in sera {{of different ages}} of mice, which bind <b>to</b> <b>wounded</b> tissues. We detected IgG 1 binding <b>to</b> <b>wounded</b> tissues by using FITC-labeled anti-IgG 1 in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. These bands were highest in 4 months old C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The sera taken from 2 months and 20 months old mice also bound <b>to</b> <b>wounded</b> tissues, although the bands were weaker than those of 4 months old mice. We also examined the autoreactive IgM binding <b>to</b> <b>wounded</b> tissues. We could detect relatively strong bands even in 2 M old mice. The pattern of these bands was changed by advancing age. Intensity of IgM bands was not decreased by advancing age. The splenectomy reduced the intensity of IgG 1 bands especially in 4 months old mice. Although we observed the slight delay of wound repair by splenectomy in 2 M and 20 M old mice, we observed that wound repair was strongly delayed in 4 M old mice. Serum from any age of mice enhanced the macrophage phagocytosis by opsonization. Serum taken from splenectomized mice decreased the opsonizing capacity only at 4 M...|$|R

25|$|Many {{patients}} {{will be in}} pain and have a loss of appetite after surgery. Part of the body's response to surgery is to direct energy <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> healing, which increases the body's overall energy requirements. Surgery affects nutritional status indirectly, particularly during the recovery period, as it can interfere with wound healing {{and other aspects of}} recovery. Surgery directly affects nutritional status if a procedure permanently alters the digestive system. Enteral nutrition (tube feeding) is often needed. However a policy of 'nil by mouth' for all gastrointestinal surgery has not been shown to benefit, with some suggestion it might hinder recovery.|$|E

Eventually the Polish army was back in its main camp, and under artillery fire. Gustavus Adolphus decided to scout the field again before the final assault but was spotted by the Poles. He was targeted by infantry marksmen, who managed <b>to</b> <b>wound</b> him in the neck and arm, dropping him from the horse.
