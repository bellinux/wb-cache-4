5|$|Marko was {{associated}} with large, solitary boulders and indentations in rocks; <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> {{were said to be}} thrown by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he did something memorable. They were often named after him, and there are many toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.|$|E
5|$|The Olmec colossal {{heads are}} at least {{seventeen}} monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders. The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. All portray mature individuals with fleshy cheeks, flat noses, and slightly crossed eyes; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz. The backs of the monuments often are flat. <b>The</b> <b>boulders</b> were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances, requiring {{a great deal of}} human effort and resources, it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers. Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress. The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres, but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear.|$|E

25|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of the fine-grained rock using optical mineralogy, X-ray crystallography, and electron microprobe has determined that <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> consist of mud, fine silt and clay, cemented by calcite. The degree of cementation varies from being relatively weak {{in the interior of}} a boulder to quite hard at its outside rim. The outside rims of the larger boulders consist of as much as 10 to 20% calcite because the calcite not only tightly cements the silt and clay but has also replaced it to a significant degree.|$|E

Once <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> are removed and the jade is accessible, it is broken down into more manageable 10-tonne pieces using water-cooled diamond saws.

Initially, the Confederates atop the rocks lied flat trying to ascertain through the fog whether the approaching cavalry were their returning scouting party. The Union troops at the base of Hanging Rocks were naturally suspicious of the strategic location and were on high alert as they crossed the ford and made their way onto the pike. The Union troops noticed heads of the Confederate militamen peering over the cliffs and fired upon them. The Confederates responded to the firing by hurling <b>the</b> <b>boulders</b> onto the road below causing the Union cavalry to hastily retreat down the pike and across the ford.

25|$|The crags of Dove Crag are the fell's finest feature. The crag {{is about}} 75 metres high {{at its highest}} point and is a popular venue for rock climbers with classic routes such as Extol and Fast and Furious.
