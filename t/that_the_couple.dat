5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{discrepancy}} {{regarding the}} number of children born to Richard and Hetty Hawes. Harrison claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> had two children, while Neace and Harned mention four sons. The 1850 census showed six Hawes children living in the household: four sons and two daughters. This did not include James Morrison Hawes, who was already an instructor at the United States Military Academy by 1850.|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E

5|$|Domnall was {{a son of}} Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086). Domnall was, therefore, {{a member}} of the Meic Taidc. According to the twelfth-century Banshenchas, Domnall's father married Mór, {{daughter}} of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1064/1065). This source specifies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> had three sons and a daughter: Amlaíb (died 1096), Bé Binn, Donnchad (died 1113), and Domnall himself.|$|E

He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E

She later admitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> were naive about {{what it takes to make}} a successful fashion enterprise. Edun encountered problems with both quality of goods and delivery times from their African suppliers, and most of the stores originally carrying the line dropped it. It lost €9.7 million in 2007 and €12.8 million in 2008, suffering along with the rest of the apparel sector from the credit crisis of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation of Nazi Germany. His relationship with Eva Braun, which lasted nearly 14 years, was hidden from the public and all but his inner circle. Braun biographer Heike Görtemaker notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> enjoyed a normal sex life. Hitler and Braun married in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together.|$|E

The couple courted long-distance for six years while Mialy completed her undergraduate and masters studies in finance and accounting in Paris; they were reunited in Madagascar in 2000 and wed the same year. Their marriage produced two boys, Arena (born 2002) and Ilonstoa (born 2005), and a daughter born in 2007 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> named Andrialy, a contraction of their own names.|$|E

As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way}} to right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry's coordinator, {{was removed}} from his post and {{transferred}} from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper Diário de Notícias that the British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns, ignoring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> were suspects.

5|$|A fourth {{trial in}} the death of James Kinne was {{scheduled}} for October 1964; however, in September 1964, Kinne, still free on her $25,000 bond, traveled to Mexico with an alleged lover, Francis Samuel Puglise leaving her children with James Kinne's father and traveling as Pugliese's wife under the name Jeanette Pugliese. The couple later said that they had come to Mexico to get married. Under the legal terms of her bail, Kinne was permitted to leave the country, but her contract with the company that posted her bond prohibited her from leaving Missouri without written permission from the company's agents. After crossing the border, the couple registered at a local hotel, Hotel Gin, again as husband and wife. Kinne, saying that she felt unsafe in the foreign country, bought a pistol—which meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> now possessed multiple guns, having brought one or two with them from the United States.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E
5|$|Buffon married Czech model Alena Šeredová in June 2011, {{although}} {{they had been in}} a relationship together since 2005. They have two children, Louis Thomas (born in 2007 and named after Buffon's idol Thomas N'Kono) and David Lee (born in 2009). In May 2014, Buffon announced that he had separated from his wife after three years of marriage. He was soon romantically linked to Italian sports pundit, journalist and television host Ilaria D'Amico. In 2015, Buffon announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> were expecting a child together. On 6 January 2016, the couple announced the birth of their son Leopoldo Mattia on Twitter earlier that evening. In the summer of 2017, the pair became engaged.
