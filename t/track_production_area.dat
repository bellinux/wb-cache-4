5000|$|The {{concept of}} 2 main data {{processing}} hubs, the L1 and L2, also divided the UK into 2 areas deemed the Northern <b>Track</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Area</b> (NTPA) and the Southern <b>Track</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Area</b> (STPA). The L1 primarily looked after the STPA with inputs from four main sites, these were, RAF Neatishead in Norfolk, RAF Staxton Wold in Yorkshire, RAF Boulmer in Northumberland and RAF Bishops Court in Northern Ireland. To this {{there were also}} inputs from 6 Civilian Radars at Ash, Ventnor, Clee Hill, Burington, London 1 and London 2. It was understood {{from the start that}} the L1 site, above ground and made largely of glass, was subject to air attack; as the second [...] "L2" [...] site originally planned to be built underground at Prestwick was never carried out elements of the air defence system were devolved out to use the standby capabilities of the radar sites. That Standby capability was the Standby Local Early Warning and Control (SLEWC) systems at RAF Neatishead and RAF Boulmer.|$|E
