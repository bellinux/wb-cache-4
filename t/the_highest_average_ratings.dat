40|$|Relatively few parapsychological {{experiments}} investigating micro-PK {{effects have}} been designed to consider psychological or individual differences factors, and those variables that have been considered have been subject to too few replications to give a clear indication of which persons may perform best under which conditions. Previous research by the first author discovered and replicated an interaction effect between an individual differences factor, participant lability, and a situational factor, target system lability. The present study was designed to conceptually replicate that finding using a novel task so as to control for possible artifacts. An alternative task was built around the I Ching divination procedure, which it was felt retained important characteristics of being personally relevant for the participant and intuitively straightforward to understand. An opportunity sample of 34 participants completed a measure of lability and decided upon a personal question that the I Ching could help with. Participants were run individually and completed a Q-sort of all 64 hexagram descriptions based on their applicability to their question. Once completed they cast three hexagrams using a computer based program that used a live random number generator (Live), the pseudorandom function of the computer (Pseudo) and a predetermined list of random numbers derived from published tables (Table). The Q-sort positions were used to rate the applicability of the selected hexagrams. Although the general pattern of performance was in line with prediction, with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>average</b> <b>ratings</b> awarded to hexagrams selected by the most labile Live method, next highest for the moderately labile Pseudo method and worst ratings for the most stabile Table method, the mean shifts were small and nonsignificant. Similarly, although the highest overall performance was achieved by the most labile participant group, an intermediate level of performance was recorded by the intermediate group and worst performance was by the stabile group, the modest differences were not significant. Therefore, despite the pattern of performance being superficially similar to that reported in previous studies, this experiment was not able to replicate the interaction between participant and target system lability.

40|$|Computer games, {{especially}} Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games, have elements where {{communication between}} players {{is of great}} need. This communication is generally conducted through in-game text chats, in-game voice chats or external voice programs. In-game voice chats can be constructed {{to work in a}} similar way as talking does in real life. When someone talks, anyone close enough to that person can hear what is said, with a volume depending on distance. This is called positional or spatial voice chat in games. This differs from the commonly implemented voice chat where participants in conversations are statically defined by a team or group belonging. Positional voice chat has been around for quite some time in games {{and it seems to be}} of interest for a lot of users, despite this, it is still not very common. This thesis investigates impacts of implementing a positional voice chat in the existing MMORPG Mortal Online by Star Vault. How is it built, what are the costs, how many users can it support and what do the users think of it? These are some of the questions answered within this project. The design science research method has been selected as scientific method. A product in form of a positional voice chat library has been constructed. This library has been integrated into the existing game engine and its usage has been evaluated by the game’s end users. Results show a positional voice system that in theory supports up to 12500 simultaneous users can be built from scratch and be patched into an existing game in less than 600 man-hours. The system needs third-party libraries for threading, audio input/output, audio compression, network communication and mathematics. All libraries used in the project are free for use in commercial products and do not demand code using them become open source. Based on a survey taken by more than 200 users, the product received good ratings on Quality of Experience and most users think having a positional voice chat in a game like Mortal Online is important. Results show a trend of young and less experienced users giving <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>average</b> <b>ratings</b> on quality, usefulness and importance of the positional voice chat, suggesting it may be a good tool to attract new players to a game...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Tourism)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2002. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{strategic}} tourism-planning model for provincial authorities. In order to achieve this goal, a literature study was firstly necessary to determine the important aspects identified for strategic tourism planning by researchers working in that field. Secondly, the nine provinces were asked to forward their existing provincial strategic tourism plans. Only five of the nine provinces complied with this request. These five provincial strategic plans were compared, to identify those aspects which the provinces perceive as important for the present tourism industry, and to identify the aspects which they incorporate in their strategic plans. This was done in Table 3. 2. Before investigating and evaluating the present strategic plans, criteria had to be identified for this purpose. The White Paper on Tourism (1996) identified ten key success factors for provinces to achieve. In Table 3. 3 these ten key success factors were applied as criteria to evaluate the five existing provincial strategic tourism plans. From the literature study eleven key strategic elements for provincial tourism were identified. These were discussed in chapter 2. In Table 3. 4 the five existing provincial strategic tourism plans were evaluated against the above eleven key strategic elements. It was shown that a tourist's decision and the unique tourism circumstances (attractions) of the provinces' natural resources (including the "Big Five" tourism attractions) are very important to a strategic tourism plan and that it had to be included in the proposed provincial strategic tourism planning model. A questionnaire including the above aspects and elements was compiled. The objective of the questionnaire was to measure the importance which the nine provinces attach to the identified elements. Questionnaires were sent out to the nine provinces, for them to complete and return. A 100 % response rate was achieved. The results of the questionnaire were discussed in line with the eleven key strategic elements. From the results the following conclusions can be made: In their strategic plans provincial tourism authorities focussed primarily on marketing. All nine provinces rated safety and security as important and felt that it should be included in a provincial strategic tourism plan. On the other hand, aspects such as staff training, women in tourism, providing for disabled people in tourism, secondary services, health-related issues, provinces' natural resources (biomes), provinces' involvement in new tourism business and globalisation got low ratings. Safety and security and the promotion strategy received <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>average</b> <b>ratings</b> (96 %). This study concluded with a number of recommendations, of which the following are the most important: To implement the proposed provincial strategic tourism planning model. To research practical actions that can be implemented to protect tourists against criminal elements while visiting a province. To research how the quality of service can be improved in a province's tourism industry. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} study had two distinct objectives. The first {{objective was to}} determine in which areas in South African banks the most severe operational risk losses are likely to occur (based on the Basel II seven loss event types and eight business lines). Severity was assessed based on single operational risk events that might have significant monetary values attached to them. The likely frequency of single operational risk events was also assessed. The investigation of the aforementioned research problem was explorative and quantitative of nature, as the researcher made extensive use of survey research {{in the form of}} a questionnaire to all registered banks. The second part of the {{research study}}’s objective was to assess the range of practices in collecting internal loss data for operational risk purposes as required by Basel II. This part was approached from a qualitative perspective, by benchmarking the research findings against the Basel II text, the researcher’s experience in risk management in banks, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Sound Practices for the Management and Supervision of Operational Risk, and related literature. The literature review, including reference to certain surveys and studies, focuses on the main concepts of operational risk within banks that are pertinent to the research problem. The literature review also includes several references to the Basel II text and other relevant publications and papers issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The research results revealed that respondents in South African banks believed that ‘business disruption and system failures’ is the loss event type that is likely to result in the most severe single operational risk loss. ‘Trading and sales’ scored the same high average rating as ‘business disruption and system failures’ as the business line where the most severe single operational risk loss is likely to occur in South African banks. ‘External fraud’ and ‘execution, delivery and process management’ scored <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>average</b> <b>ratings</b> as the loss event types where the most frequent operational risk losses are likely to occur. Respondents indicated that ‘retail banking’ is the business line where the most frequent single operational risk losses are likely to occur in South African banks. Based on the above-mentioned findings the researcher recommends that these high-risk areas be highlighted to the Bank Supervision Department of the South African Reserve Bank, the boards of directors and senior management of banks in order for them to strengthen banks’ internal controls. The researcher recommends the inclusion of near misses and opportunity cost in operational risk loss databases. Banks should at least capture the date of the discovery of an operational risk event as this represents acceptable practice among the majority of banks. Operational risk losses should be assigned to the multiple business activities in which it occurred on a pro-rata basis. All recoveries of operational risk losses should be processed separately, but associated with the original loss event. Replacement cost is seen as the most appropriate way to capture gross loss amounts for the damage to fixed assets. The researcher encourages the recording of overtime cost for fixing systems failures. Market risk losses due to operational risk events should be treated as market risk losses, while loan-related losses due to operational risk failures should be treated as credit risk losses by banks. The researcher’s view is that banks should set different thresholds for the collection of operational risk losses for its various business units based on each business unit’s operations and nature of business. Banks should, as a starting point, map operational risk events to the Basel II 8 x 7 matrix. Operational risk losses should be assessed by both legal entity and on a consolidated basis...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} life goal {{characteristics}} and goal adjustment capacities {{of persons with}} lower limb amputation on admission to rehabilitation, and to examine their efficacy as predictors of psychosocial outcomes 6 months post-discharge. Design: Prospective, descriptive. Setting: Two specialist inpatient rehabilitation facilities in Ireland. Subjects: A consecutive sample of 64 patients with lower limb amputation. Main measures: On admission to rehabilitation, life goal characteristics (goal importance, goal disturbance) were assessed using the Goal Facilitation Index and goal adjustment capacities (goal disengagement, goal re-engagement) were measured using the Goal Adjustment Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales-Revised assessed depressive symptomatology and psychosocial adjustment to amputation at 6 months post-discharge. Results: <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>average</b> importance <b>ratings</b> were assigned to goals associated with interpersonal relationships, independence, and subjective well-being. Goals related to physical limitations and disruptions in daily activities received <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> hindrance ratings. Goal importance (β = - 0. 33) and goal disengagement (β = - 0. 29) on admission significantly predicted depressive symptomatology 6 months post-discharge (p ≤. 05).

Two different degrees of preparatory finishing of 100 % cotton print cloth were evaluated: bleach-ing only (BL), and bleaching followed by caustic mercerization and liquid ammonia treatment (BL-CM/AT). The two pretreated fabrics were finished separately by one-and two-sided foam applications at 25 % wet pick-up with various levels of FC (0 75, 1. 00, and 1. 25 %) and fixed DMDHEU resin (4. 00 %) add-on, and at 21 % wet pick-up with 1. 00 % FC/ 3. 80 % DMDHEU add-on. Performance properties (water and oil repellency, wrinkle recovery, and durable press appearance rating) of foam finished cotton fabrics were examined. One-sided foam application of FC and DP finishes resulted in excellent water and oil repellency on the applied side while leaving the nonapplied side absorbent. At the same time similar durable press properties were obtained on both sides. At corre-sponding chemical add-ons with the one-sided foam application technique, the com-bination pretreatment (BL-CM/AT) resulted in slightly higher water and oil repellency values. There was no clear trend with two-sided foam treatments in-dicating that degree of fabric preparation was not as important with the two-sided foam technique. As was expected, both oil and water repellency increased as the fluorochemical add-on increased with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>average</b> water spray <b>ratings</b> of 90. 0 and oil drop ratings of 5. 0 being attained with the 1. 25 % FC/ 4. 00 % DMDHEU treatment.

Participants who reported higher measures of trait-level anxiety were found to have significantly lower mean levels of daily self-esteem. Both anxiety and fearfulness were found to be negatively related to BDI measures, and negatively related to positive deactive affect. Anxiety was also found to be positively related to negative active affect and negative deactive affect. Fearfulness was negatively related to positive active affect. Sentimentality was found to be positively related to daily self-esteem, BDI scores, and positive active affect.
