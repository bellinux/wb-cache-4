25|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the use of a {{standardized}} written language increased with each new innovation of communication and transportation.

25|$|The {{basis for}} {{division}} into zones was the two distinct paths of the heavenly bodies: {{that of the}} stars {{and that of the}} sun and moon. Astronomers know <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Earth revolving around the sun is tilted on its axis, bringing each hemisphere now closer to the sun, now further away. The Greeks had the opposite model, that the stars and the sun rotated around the earth. The stars moved in fixed circles around the poles. The sun moved at an oblique angle to the circles, which obliquity brought it now to the north, now to the south. The circle of the sun was the ecliptic. It was the center of a band called the zodiac on which various constellations were located.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of Peter in Rome, not explicitly affirmed in, but consistent with, the New Testament, is explicitly affirmed by Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyon and other early Christian writers – {{and no other}} place has ever {{claimed to be the}} location of his death. The same witnesses imply that Peter was the virtual founder of the Church of Rome, though not its founder in the sense of initiating a Christian community there. They also speak of Peter as the one who initiated its episcopal succession, but speak of Linus as the first bishop of Rome after Peter, although some hold <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Christians in Rome did not act a single united community under a single leader until the 2nd century.|$|E
25|$|Between the Garonne and Loire rivers {{there are}} known to have been at least seventy-seven churches whose naves were covered by a line of domes. Half of them are in the Périgord region. Most date to the twelfth century and sixty of them survive <b>today.</b> <b>That</b> <b>the</b> domes in this area were {{arranged}} in linear series has suggested the contemporary architecture of Cyprus as the inspiration, which was located on a pilgrimage route to the Holy Land. Cyprus had developed its own style of domed basilica during its period of neutrality between Byzantine and Arab rulers, using three domes of roughly equal size in a line over the nave and very little lighting. There are indications of a connection between Aquitaine and Cyprus just after the First Crusade.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held <b>today,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E

25|$|Before Hipparchus, astronomers {{knew that}} the lengths of the seasons are not equal. Hipparchus made {{observations}} of equinox and solstice, and according to Ptolemy (Almagest III.4) determined that spring (from spring equinox to summer solstice) lasted 94½ days, and summer (from summer solstice to autumn equinox) 92½ days. This is inconsistent with a premise of the Sun moving around the Earth in a circle at uniform speed. Hipparchus's solution was to place the Earth not {{at the center of}} the Sun's motion, but at some distance from the center. This model described the apparent motion of the Sun fairly well. It is known <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planets, including the Earth, move in approximate ellipses around the Sun, but this was not discovered until Johannes Kepler published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609. The value for the eccentricity attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy is that the offset is 1/24 of the radius of the orbit (which is a little too large), and the direction of the apogee would be at longitude 65.5° from the vernal equinox. Hipparchus may also have used other sets of observations, which would lead to different values. One of his two eclipse trios' solar longitudes are consistent with his having initially adopted inaccurate lengths for spring and summer of 95¾ and 91¼ days. His other triplet of solar positions is consistent with 94¼ and 92½ days, an improvement on the results (94½ and 92½ days) attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy, which a few scholars still question the authorship of. Ptolemy made no change three centuries later, and expressed lengths for the autumn and winter seasons which were already implicit (as shown, e.g., by A. Aaboe).|$|E

500|$|Jäger's report {{provides}} an almost daily running total of the liquidations of 137,346 people, {{the vast majority}} of them Jews. The report documents the exact date and place of massacres, the number of victims, and their breakdown into categories (Jews, Communists, criminals, and so on). Women were shot from the very beginning, but initially in fewer numbers than men. Children were first included in the tally starting in mid-August, when 3,207 people were murdered in Rokiškis on 15–16 August 1941. For the most part the report does not give any military justification for the killings; people were killed solely because they were Jews. In total, the report lists over 100 executions in 71 different locations. Jäger wrote: [...] "I can state <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> goal of solving the Jewish problem in Lithuania has been reached by Einsatzkommando 3. There are no more Jews in Lithuania, apart from working Jews and their families." [...] In a February 1942 addendum to the report, Jäger increased the total number of victims to 138,272, giving a breakdown of 48,252 men, 55,556 women, and 34,464 children. Only 1,851 of the victims were non-Jewish.|$|E
500|$|A 2003 {{interview}} in Newsweek quotes Stephenson's belief that [...] "science fiction... is fiction in which ideas {{play an important}} part." [...] Central to Quicksilver [...] {{is the importance of}} the Enlightenment. By placing the reader among a world of ideas that change the course of science, Stephenson explores the development of the scientific method. One theme Stephenson explores in Quicksilver is the advancement of mathematical sciences which in turn led to important applications: Leibniz's theory of binary mathematics became the foundation upon which to develop computers. [...] As he did in Cryptonomicon, Stephenson highlights the importance of networks and codes, which in Quicksilver [...] occur against a [...] "backdrop of staggering diversity and detail", writes Mark Sanderson in his review of the book for the Daily Telegraph. Also, returning to his cyberpunk roots, Stephenson emphasizes the manner in which information and ideas are dispersed in complex societies. Quicksilver uses the [...] "interactions of philosophy, court intrigue, economics, wars, plagues and natural disasters" [...] of the late 17th and early 18th century to create a historical backdrop. From one perspective, the characters are most useful in their roles as [...] "carriers of information". Although the characters use various techniques to disseminate information, the most prominent is cryptography. Elizabeth Weisse writes in USA <b>Today</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of cryptography is [...] "Stephenson's literary calling card", as she compares Quicksilver to [...] Cryptonomicon.|$|E
