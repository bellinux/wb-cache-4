5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E

25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E

The Heinzelmänchen of Cologne marched from the city and sailed away when a tailor's wife strewed peas on the stairs to trip them so she could see them. In 1850, Keightley noted that the Heinzelmänchen [...] " [...] totally disappeared, as has been {{everywhere}} the case, owing to the curiosity of people, which has at all times been the destruction of so much of what was beautiful in the world." ...|$|E

Although Genie's father refused to speak to police or the media, large crowds subsequently went <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him, which he reportedly found extremely difficult to handle. On November 20, the morning before a scheduled court appearance on child abuse charges, he committed suicide by gunshot. Police found two suicide notes, one intended for his son which in part said, [...] "Be a good boy, I love you", and one directed at police. One note—sources conflict as to which—contained the declaration, [...] "The world will never understand." ...|$|E

[...] Pearl’s board noticed that the larger brewers such as Anheuser-Busch were not attempting to push more and more products out of a single brewery; instead, they had several breweries spread out to distribute their products. [...] Pearl seized on the idea of a second brewery and began to explore the options. [...] Location was a huge factor in the considerations. [...] San Antonio’s location allowed Pearl to reach both the East and West Coasts equally well. [...] However, San Antonio’s southern position was not ideal for reaching places such as Maine or Washington state.|$|E

According to traditional oppinion, stress must be appeared before or, at least, at the moment of coping appearance if we want to speak about coping process. In this paper, we argued about new conceptualization of stress and coping - preventive and proactive coping. Coping process could start even before stressful event occurred. Person could take a several steps (preventive meassures) which are going to make her to be able to cope some future event that could be interpreted like threat, risk or loss, and that would be preventive coping. Also, person could set to herself a goals and ambitions to whom she will going <b>to,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a chance for new development and grow, and that would be proactive coping...|$|R

In April 1862, he was in dire financial straits - he owed 20 pounds for rent which he could not pay, {{and he had no}} money to redeem pawned clothing of his children and of the maid, Helene Demuth. In August 1862, he travelled to Zaltbommel in the Netherlands, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his uncle Lion Philips for financial help. However, Philips was away on a trip himself, and Marx travelled on <b>to</b> <b>Trier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his mother, who, however, did not give him any money. In September, Marx applied for a job in an English railway office, {{with the help of his}} cousin August Philips, but failed to get it because of his illegible handwriting. In October, Marx received 20 pounds from his cousin August Philips, and in November, when Marx was unable to pay for coal and groceries, Friedrich Engels also sent him money.|$|R

He looked about him. The party, excepting himself and Mr. Du Brant, were on the front lawn; he would join them and satirize the gloomy Austrian. If Olive could be made to laugh at him it would be like preparing a garden-bed with spade and rake before sowing his seeds.|$|E

In two days, however, the messengers returned, stating that they had found what they supposed to be the intrenched camp of the heavy infantry man they had been sent in search of, but that it was entirely deserted, and nobody could be seen anywhere near it.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt the}} secret {{inclination}} strengthening within me {{to return to}} Hollyoake Square; <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the girl again, {{or at least to}} ascertain who she was. I strove--yes, I can honestly say, strove to repress the desire. I tried to laugh it off, as idle and ridiculous; to think of my sister, of the book I was writing, of anything but the one subject that pressed stronger and stronger on me, the harder I struggled against it. The spell of the syren was over me. I went out, hypocritically persuading myself, that I was only animated by a capricious curiosity to know the girl's name, which once satisfied, would leave me at rest on the matter, and free to laugh at my own idleness and folly as soon as I got home again.|$|E

Presently Peter came to a place where the bank was very low and the water was shallow for quite a little {{distance}} out in the Smiling Pool.

He watched the sorrel's savage head, pointed level, his mouth still closed and dry, but his nostrils distended {{as if he were}} snorting unseen fire. Wrangle was the horse for a race with death. Upon each side Venters saw the sage merged into a sailing, colorless wall. In front sloped the lay of ground with its purple breadth split by the white trail. The wind, blowing with heavy, steady blast into his face, sickened him with enduring, sweet odor, and filled his ears with a hollow, rushing roar.|$|E

All the Demdike women went down at one time. I turned quickly to see how mother was, and she was down. Right {{alongside}} of us, out of the bushes, came hundreds of Indians, all shooting. I saw the two Dunlap sisters start on the run across the sand, and took after them, for whites and Indians were all killing us. And as I ran I saw the driver {{of one of the}} wagons shooting the two wounded men. The horses of the other wagon were plunging and rearing and their driver was trying to hold them.|$|E

And even while I still {{continued}} to be a haunter of the graveyard, I began insensibly to turn my attention to the grave-diggers, and was weaned out of myself to observe the conduct of visitors. This was day-spring, indeed, to a lad in such great darkness. Not that I began to see men, or <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them, from within, nor to learn charity and modesty and justice from the sight; but still stared at them externally from the prison windows of my affectation. Once I remember to have observed two working women with a baby halting by a grave; there was something monumental in the grouping, one upright carrying the child, the other with bowed face crouching by her side. A wreath of immortelles under a glass dome had thus attracted them; and, drawing near, I overheard their judgment on that wonder: [...] "Eh! what extravagance!" [...] To a youth afflicted with the callosity of sentiment, this quaint and pregnant saying appeared merely base.|$|E
