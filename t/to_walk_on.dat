5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether {{for the opportunity to}} command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E

5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> either two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased {{the height of the}} back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the keys}} for the Hokie defense would be linebacker Brandon Manning, who {{attended}} the Air Force Academy's preparatory school before deciding <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> to Virginia Tech's football team instead of attending the Academy.

Virginia Tech defensive tackle Jimmy Williams injured his ankle twodays prior to the game, causing him to be unable to play. Tech's Richard Johnson was also listed as injured and unlikely to play.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{made his}} second space flight as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third {{successful}} lunar landing mission. Shepard piloted the lunar module Antares {{to the most}} accurate landing of the entire Apollo program. He became the fifth and, {{at the age of}} 47, the oldest man <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the moon, and {{the only one of the}} Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on.</b> Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the surface of the water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
50|$|The guidebook {{was largely}} text-based, with maps by John Bartholomew. Compared with later {{photographic}} volumes directed mainly at rock-climbers and hill-walkers, {{produced by the}} Abraham Brothers and by W. A. Poucher, and the highly detailed hand-illustrated guides of Alfred Wainwright, Baddeley's guide was more general, giving motoring and accommodation advice and low-level walks as well as outline guides <b>to</b> <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> the fells.|$|R

5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only {{sets the tone for}} the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and {{the first}} person <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the Moon. He was also an {{aerospace}} engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was {{an officer in the}} U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.|$|E

5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the crash}} {{did not affect}} space flight {{operations}} and the spacecraft itself was undamaged—it was shipped to NASA {{two days after the}} crash—the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9, re-designated Gemini 9A. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the back-up crew for Gemini 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without experience during the Gemini mission, Buzz Aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson family spent Christmas in England, {{before a}} trip to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, where Simpson injured himself skiing, {{suffering}} a broken foot and a sprained ankle. He recovered, riding six-day races. At the Antwerp six-day, he dropped out {{on the fourth day}} with a cold. His cold worsened and he missed most of March. He abandoned Milan–San Remo {{at the foot of the}} Poggio. On 11 April, he finished seventh in Paris–Roubaix after crashing in the lead group. The crash forced him to miss the Tour of Flanders as he struggled <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> his injured foot. In Liège–Bastogne–Liège he attacked with 's Felice Gimondi, catching an early break. They worked together for , until Gimondi gave up.

5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want <b>to</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>on</b> Water, You've Got to Get Out of the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pier}} opened on 5 June 1867, again under Cecil Hugh Smyth Pigott, {{many of the}} people of Weston-super-Mare were given a holiday and a banquet was held in the Town Hall. The toll <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the pier was 1d (an old penny), but this was quickly raised to 2d, which was the maximum fee {{permitted}} by the General Pier and Harbour Act 1861. 120,000 people paid the toll in the first three months.

40|$|The {{starting}} point is the known fact that some much-studied random <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> permutations, such as the Tsetlin library, arise from <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> real hyperplane arrangements. This paper explores similar <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> complex hyperplane arrangements. This is achieved by involving certain cell complexes naturally associated with the arrangement. In a particular case this leads <b>to</b> <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> libraries with several shelves. We also show that interval greedoids give rise <b>to</b> random <b>walks</b> belonging <b>to</b> the same general family. Members of this family of Markov chains, based on certain semigroups, have the property that all eigenvalues of the transition matrices are non-negative real and given by a simple combinatorial formula. Background material needed for understanding the walks is reviewed in rather great detail...|$|R
