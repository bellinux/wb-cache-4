500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn. Based on a metal carving in the 16th century, these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes. It features a skeleton on a throne that is standing {{on top of the}} world, and the words [...] "The mirror which flatters not." [...] Flynn thought [...] "this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves. It's talking about things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> now, but it's not necessarily specific to this time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, John's wife. Charlotte Gainsbourg was {{originally}} set {{to play the}} part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film. As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician. Howard suggested, {{as part of the}} character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day. The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lacking basic supplies such as clean water, which [...] "reflects things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> currently in this privileged world that we are living in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world. I think that's something definitely for us to reinvestigate and that we continue to make choices for our own future to take that into consideration". Howard focused on Kate [...] "being accustomed to fear and loss" [...] because the character was a military brat.|$|E

2500|$|I wouldn't {{know what}} to do with [...] Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on {{continuing}} to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Turn to You" [...] was shot from February 26 to February 28, 2000 {{and it was}} {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn. According to Aguilera, [...] "This video {{is a little different}} than my other videos [...] I'm pretty much on a stage just belting my heart out. And the whole city that I'm singing out to, and I'm narrating different events <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in this city are in-sync with me." [...] Production was finished on March 26, 2000, and it premiered on April 3, 2000, during the MTV'S Making the Video and made it world premiere on MTV's Total Request Live on April 10, 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Lupe Fiasco was {{supposedly}} {{going to release}} a triple album, titled LupE.N.D. as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. From then he postponed LupE.N.D. indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively titled The Great American Rap Album in June 2009. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled We Are Lasers and then changed to Lasers. [...] "Lasers" [...] is a backronym for [...] "Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile". Referring to {{the title of the}} album, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I've always had that word in my head, I'm a word guy. And I thought 'lasers' would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it I just put it in my 'think-tank' and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. Thatâ€™s why I made it an acronym [...] to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it's bringing light to different circumstances which is what I try and do - bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the world, and 'L.A.S.E.R.S' is no different.|$|E

60|$|For {{emancipation}} {{from the}} Trinitarian formularies {{and from a}} belief in an infinite God means not merely a great revivification of minds trained under the decadence of orthodox Christianity, minds which have hitherto been hopelessly embarrassed by the choice between pseudo-Christian religion or denial, but also it opens the way towards the completest understanding and sympathy and participation with the kindred movements for release and for an intensification of the religious life, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> outside the sphere of the Christian tradition and influence altogether.
