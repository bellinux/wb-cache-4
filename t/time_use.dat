Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>use</b> of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{advances}} in data collection have vastly improved {{our ability to}} understand important relationships between retirement and factors such as health, wealth, employment characteristics and family dynamics, among others. The most prominent study for examining retirement behavior in the United States is the ongoing Health and Retirement Study (HRS), first fielded in 1992. The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults in the U.S. ages 51+, conducted every two years, and contains {{a wealth of information}} on such topics as labor force participation (e.g., current employment, job history, retirement plans, industry/occupation, pensions, disability), health (e.g., health status and history, health and life insurance, cognition), financial variables (e.g., assets and income, housing, net worth, wills, consumption and savings), family characteristics (e.g., family structure, transfers, parent/child/grandchild/sibling information) {{and a host of other}} topics (e.g., expectations, expenses, internet use, risk taking, psychosocial, <b>time</b> <b>use).</b>|$|E
500|$|The method {{most widely}} used to measure unpaid work is {{gathering}} information on <b>time</b> <b>use,</b> which has [...] "been implemented by at least 20 developing countries and more are underway" [...] as of 2006. <b>Time</b> <b>use</b> measurement involves collecting data on how much time men and women spend on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis on certain activities that fall under the categories of unpaid work.|$|E

500|$|... "suggests that activity-based surveys {{should be}} {{supplemented}} by more stylized questions regarding care responsibilities" [...] as otherwise such {{activities can be}} undercounted. In the past, <b>time</b> <b>use</b> studies tended to measure only primary activities, and [...] "respondents doing two or more things at once {{were asked to indicate}} which was the more important." [...] This has been changing in more recent years.|$|E
500|$|Techniques {{to gather}} this data include surveys, {{in-depth}} interviews, diaries, and participant observation.

[...] However, others argue that participant observation, [...] "where the researcher spends lengthy periods of time in households helping out and observing the labor process," [...] generates more accurate information because the researcher can ascertain whether or not those studied are accurately reporting what activities they perform.|$|E
500|$|A third {{problem is}} the {{complexity}} of domestic labor and the issues of separating unpaid work categories. <b>Time</b> <b>use</b> studies now take multitasking issues into account, separating primary and secondary activities. However, not all studies do this, and even those that do may {{not take into account}} [...] "the fact that frequently several tasks are done simultaneously, that tasks overlap, and that the boundaries between work and relationships are often unclear. How does a woman determine her primary activity when she is preparing dinner while putting the laundry away, making coffee for her spouse, having coffee and chatting with him, and attending to the children?" [...] Some activities may not even be considered work, such as playing with a child (this has been categorized as developmental care work) and so may not be included in a study's responses.

500|$|The {{first problem}} of {{measuring}} unpaid {{work is the}} issue of collecting accurate information. This is always a concern in research studies, but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work. [...] "Time-use surveys may reveal relatively little time devoted to unpaid direct care activities [...] the demands of subsistence production in those countries are great," [...] and may not take into account multitasking [...] for example, a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in the same location, so the child is in her care while she is performing other work. Usually such indirect care should be included, as it is in many <b>time</b> <b>use</b> studies. But it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work. Participant observation has been criticized for being [...] "so time-consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households," [...] and thus limited in the amount of information {{it can be used to}} gather.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} Sunny Day Real Estate defined the [...] "emo" [...] genre for many. Weezer's album Pinkerton (1996) was also influential.

Popular acts {{included}} platinum selling success of Bleed American by Jimmy Eat World (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most (2003). The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>use</b> of the term [...] "emo" [...] expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion. The term [...] "emo" [...] has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance and disparate groups such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco, even when they reject the label.|$|E

500|$|All data {{gathering}} involves difficulties {{with the potential}} inaccuracy of research subjects' reports. For instance, when [...] "people doing domestic labor {{have no reason to}} pay close attention to the amount of time tasks take ... they [...] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities." [...] Measuring time can also be problematic because [...] "the slowest and most inefficient workers [...] the greatest workload." [...] <b>Time</b> <b>use</b> in assessing childcare is criticized as [...] "easily obscur gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in {{the same amount of time}} being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Men's standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns." [...] A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: [...] "It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies." [...] In general, measurement of time causes [...] "some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [...] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged." [...] Surveys have also been criticized for lacking [...] "depth and complexity" [...] as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario 64 is {{the first}} game to have a [...] "free" [...] camera that can be {{controlled}} independently of the character. Most 3D games from the <b>time</b> <b>use</b> a first-person perspective, or a camera that is fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic {{system in which the}} video camera is operated by the in-game character Lakitu. The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future. Nintendo Power stated the camera-control scheme is what transitioned platform games into three dimensions, and that the game, along with , [...] "blazed trails" [...] into the 3D era. Along with camera control, the game also innovated in its implementation of movement. Edge stated the game changed [...] "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever". The Nintendo 64's analog stick allows for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital D-pads of other consoles, and Super Mario 64 uses this {{in a way that was}} unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. Super Mario 64s controls are fully analog, and interpret a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allows for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs. Super Mario 64 was one of the first games to implement the system.|$|E
