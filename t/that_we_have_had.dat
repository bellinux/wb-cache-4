McGowan argued: [...] "We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now?

[...] McGowan later stated {{that she was not}} transphobic, and added: [...] "Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said.

Seven months before Lamont made the statement, inflation (as measured by the annual change in the Retail Price Index) reached 10.9%. In May 1991, inflation fell to 6.4%. A year after the Major government was reelected in the 1992 general election, winning the most votes of any political party in British electoral history, inflation fell to 4.3%, falling to 1.3% a year later.

Moratinos defended his decision, believing it better to engage with the Cuban regime than by isolating it. [...] "The U.S. established its embargo", he remarked. [...] "We don't agree with it but we respect it. What we hope is that they respect our policy", Moratinos remarked. [...] "What Spain is not prepared to do is be absent from Cuba.

2500|$|Sandiford appealed {{against this}} decision, {{but it was}} again {{rejected}} at the High Court in April 2013, by a three-judge panel, chaired by Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson.

In his summing up on 22 April Lord Dyson said that it was [...] "most unfortunate" [...] Sandiford required [...] "relatively speaking ... very small sum indeed" [...] for her legal costs, but that this [...] "cannot affect the principle <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to consider and it cannot affect our decision. It may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum {{in the course of the}} next few days." [...] The judges published their reasons for rejecting the appeal on 22 May. In the written judgement, Lord Dyson said that Sandiford had argued the Foreign Secretary's position was [...] "unlawful" [...] but that the High Court had been [...] "right to conclude" [...] it was not. [...] "As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances...But the question is not whether the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy. It is whether the policy that he has produced is irrational. I am in no doubt that the policy is not irrational. It is based on reasoning which is coherent and which is neither arbitrary nor perverse." ...|$|E

Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse.

2500|$|Powell {{donated the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount to John McCain's {{campaign in the}} summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president."

[...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
