Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church.

When the great French conductor Roger Désormière was paralysed by a stroke in 1952 Boulez sent scripts to French Radio in Désormière's name so that his mentor could collect the fee. The writer Jean Vermeil, who observed Boulez in the 1990s in the company of Jean Batigne (founder of the Percussions de Strasbourg), discovered [...] "a Boulez asking about the health of a musician in the Strasbourg orchestra, about another player's children, a Boulez who knew everyone by name and who reacted to each person's news with sadness or with joy." [...] In later life, he was known for his charm and personal warmth. Of his humour, Gerard McBurney wrote that it [...] "depended on his twinkling eyes, his perfect timing, his infectious schoolboy giggle, and his reckless compulsion always <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other person would not expect."

2500|$|In 2002, J. C. C. Mays {{pointed out}} that [...] "Coleridge's {{claim to be a}} great poet lies in the {{continued}} pursuit of the consequences of 'The Ancient Mariner,' 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' on several levels." [...] Adam Sisman, in 2006, questioned the nature of the poem itself: [...] "No one even knows whether it is complete; Coleridge describes it as a 'fragment,' but there is a case for doubting this. Maybe it is not a poem at all. Hazlitt called it 'a musical composition' ... Though literary detectives have uncovered some of its sources, its remains difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> poem is about." [...] In describing the merits of the poem and its fragmentary state, he claimed, [...] "The poem stands for itself: beautiful, sensuous and enigmatic." [...] During the same year, Jack Stillinger claimed that [...] "Coleridge wrote only a few poems of the first rank – perhaps no more than a dozen, all told – and he seems to have taken a very casual attitude toward them ... he kept 'Kubla Khan' in manuscript for nearly twenty years before offering it to the public 'rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the grounds of any supposed poetic merits'". Harold Bloom, in 2010, argued that Coleridge wrote two kinds of poems and that [...] "The daemonic group, necessarily more famous, is the triad of The Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and 'Kubla Khan.'" [...] He goes on to explain the [...] "daemonic": [...] "Opium was the avenging daemon or alastor of Coleridge's life, his dark or fallen angel, his experiential acquaintance with Milton's Satan. Opium was for him what wandering and moral tale-telling became for the Mariner – the personal shape of repetition compulsion. The lust for paradise in 'Kubla Khan,' Geraldine's lust for Christabel – these are manifestations of Coleridge's revisionary daemonization of Milton, these are Coleridge's countersublime. Poetic genius, the genial spirit itself, Coleridge must see as daemonic when it is his own rather than when it is Milton's." ...|$|E
