40|$|In a {{macrotidal}} {{environment with}} offshore breakwaters (Elmer, West Sussex) {{a new approach}} for {{the identification of the}} sediment transport pathways with grain size trend analysis (GSTA) was undertaken using statistical parameters (mean, sorting and skewness) directly derived from settling velocities distributions. The same samples were analysed with sieving (quarter- and half-phi resolution) and GSTA was performed again in order to directly compare the resultant sediment <b>transport</b> <b>directions</b> derived with the two analytical techniques. Furthermore, both regular and irregular sampling distributions were used to recalculate GSTA. Hydrodynamic data were collected in different locations around the breakwaters and net sediment <b>transport</b> <b>directions</b> were calculated in order to assess the accuracy of the sediment <b>transport</b> pathway <b>directions</b> derived with the different analytical techniques. The accuracy of settling velocity in determining the statistical parameters of the grain size distribution is identified, especially for the fine-medium sand sediments. Settling velocities produced better results than the sieving; the quarter-phi resolution producing the poorer results in comparison with the coarser half-phi resolution. The results for the different spatial sampling strategies are found to depend upon the number of samples utilised; that shows that the accuracy of the GSTA is based upon the ability of representing, adequately, the spatial distribution of the sediment parameters. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Methamphetamine {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potent full agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates brain catecholamine systems. Activation of TAAR1 increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and either completely inhibits or reverses the <b>transport</b> <b>direction</b> of the dopamine transporter (DAT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and serotonin transporter (SERT). When methamphetamine binds to TAAR1, it triggers transporter phosphorylation via protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, ultimately resulting in the internalization or reverse function of monoamine transporters. Methamphetamine is also known to increase intracellular calcium, an effect which is associated with DAT phosphorylation through a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)-dependent signaling pathway, in turn producing dopamine efflux. TAAR1 also has been shown to reduce the firing rate of neurons through direct activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels. TAAR1 activation by methamphetamine in astrocytes appears to negatively modulate the membrane expression and function of EAAT2, a type of glutamate transporter.|$|E

50|$|Due to the non-central {{symmetry}} {{in materials}} such as the wurtzite structured ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezopotential is created in the crystal by applying a stress. Owing to the simultaneous possession of piezoelectricity and semiconductor properties, the piezopotential created in the crystal has a strong effect on the carrier transport process. Generally, {{the construction of the}} basic piezotronic devices can be divided into two categories. Here we use the nanowires as the example. The first kind is that the piezoelectric nanowire was put on a flexible substrate with two ends fixed by the electrodes. In this case, when the substrate is bended, the nanowire will be purely stretched or compressed. Piezopotential will be introduced along its axis. It will modify the electric field or the Schottky barrier (SB) height at the contact area. The induced positive piezopotential at one end will reduce the SB height, while the negative piezopotential at the other end will increase it. Thus the electric transport properties will be changed. The second kind of the piezotronic device is that one end of the nanowire is fixed with electrode, while the other end is free. In this case, when a force is applied at the free end of the nanowire to bend it, the piezopotential distribution will be perpendicular to the axis of the nanowire. The introduced piezoelectric field is perpendicular to electron <b>transport</b> <b>direction,</b> just like applying a gate voltage in the traditional field-effect transistor. Thus the electron transport properties will also be changed. The materials for piezotronics should be piezoelectric semiconductors, such as ZnO, GaN and InN. Three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor is the basis of piezotronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor coupling), piezophotonics (piezoelectric-photon excitation coupling), optoelectronics, and piezophototronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor-photoexcitation). The core of these coupling relies on the piezopotential created by the piezoelectric materials.|$|E

From previous studies {{it is known that}} along the coast there are variations in <b>direction</b> of sediment <b>transport</b> known as nodal zones as well as variations in sediment transport rate. Wave Information Study (WIS) hindcast data for the interval 1976 through 1995 (United States Army Corps of Engineers, 2003) provide a spatially continuous model of the regional longshore current directions in the study area. In chapter one, all available published field studies of longshore current <b>direction</b> and sediment <b>transport</b> <b>directions</b> and rates are compiled to create a description of the direction and, whenever possible, magnitude of longshore transport. A detailed compilation of regional and local published studies are provided in tables. An interpretation of sediment <b>transport</b> rates and <b>directions</b> is provided in eight regional maps of the study area. In chapter two the results of the literature compilations are compared with gross and net potential sediment <b>transport</b> <b>directions</b> and rates modeled using WIS hindcast data. The WIS deep-water wave characteristics are used to predict the directions and rate of longshore sediment transport at local outer coast positions using the method of Ashton et al. (2003 a). The WIS-derived <b>transport</b> <b>directions,</b> including nodal zones, generally agree with the published field studies, although there are a few local inconsistencies particularly near inlets, shoals and irregular bathymetry. Trends in longshore transport rates, such as increases and decreases in gross transport rates are well represented by the WIS-derived potential transport rates. The discrepencies between the published field studies and WIS results are apparently primarily due to assumptions in the WIS model, such as assuming shore-parallel bathymetric contours...|$|R

Here we review the sedimentary characteristics of Amazonian rivers and compare these with four fluvial depositional settings from the Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary record. These sedimentary units are the Alter do Chão Formation (Brazil, Late Cretaceous-Paleogene), the Petaca Formation (Bolivia, Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene), the Mariñame and Apaporis Sand Units (Colombia, Miocene), and the Iquitos White Sand Unit (Peru, Late Miocene-Pliocene).

In the Sarek-Kvikkjokk area in northern Sweden, telescoped orthogneisses are composed of lithologies that share characteristics with the autochthonous AMCG (anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite) -suite of the Lofoten Complex in northern Norway. The allochthonous Tielma Magmatic Complex (TMC) consists of syenitic and gabbroic rocks, gabbro dykes and ferrogabbros and contains other noteworthy lithologies, such as anorthosites and Fe-Ti ores, which also occur in the Lofoten Complex. All rock types of this study show strong similarities in their trace element and rare earth element patterns with corresponding lithologies in Lofoten, which could indicate a common source and/or process of formation.

The spatially-averaged shape asymmetry of the bedforms reveals distinct pathways of ebb and flood transport. Additionally, the region-wide, ebb-oriented asymmetry of 5 % suggests net seaward-directed transport within the estuarine-coastal system, with significant seaward asymmetry at the mouth of San Francisco Bay (11 %), through the northern reaches of the Bay (7 - 8 %), and among the largest bedforms (21 % for lambda > 50 m). This general indication for the net transport of sand to the open coast strongly suggests that anthropogenic removal of sediment from the estuary, particularly along clearly defined seaward transport pathways, will limit the supply of sand to chronically eroding, open-coast beaches. The bedform asymmetry measurements significantly agree (up to ~ 76 %) with modeled annual residual <b>transport</b> <b>directions</b> derived from a hydrodynamically-calibrated numerical model, and the orientation of adjacent, flow-sculpted seafloor features such as mega-flute structures, providing a comprehensive validation of the technique.
