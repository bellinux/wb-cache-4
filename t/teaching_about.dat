5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong {{interest}} {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E

25|$|Paul's <b>teaching</b> <b>about</b> {{the end of}} {{the world}} is {{expressed}} most clearly in his letters to the Christians at Thessalonica. He assures them that the dead will rise first and be followed by those left alive. This suggests an imminent end but he is unspecific about times and seasons, and encourages his hearers to expect a delay. The form of the end will be a battle between Jesus and the man of lawlessness whose conclusion is the triumph of Christ.|$|E
