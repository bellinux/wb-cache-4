Boat train services to Newhaven started on 1 June, and {{a connection with}} Paris started on 15 July. On 8 January 1920, Victoria replaced Charing Cross as the main station for Continental services, as it had more facilities and closer locomotive and carriage facilities. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Paris via Calais and Dover began on the same day.|$|E

5|$|SAS bought Braathens in 2001, {{resulting}} in the latter taking over <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Oslo starting on 1 April 2002. All SAS Commuter services in Northern Norway were taken over by Widerøe in October 2002. Norwegian Air Shuttle started its services from Oslo to Alta on 19 August 2003, initially with three services daily. SAS and Braathens merged in 2004 to form SAS Braathens; the airline changed its name back to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{also called}} for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal, terminating all commuter train services on the lines. For <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Oppdal, NSB had an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about {{twice the number of}} passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, they were free to do so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services, so they could continue <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Oppdal, but this was rejected by the ministry.|$|E

The airline was established in 1998, offering seaplane charter flights using Cessna 421 aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Notodden started in 2000; a Cessna 441 was acquired in 2003, and from 2006 the company has used two Beechcraft.

5|$|Domestic {{high-speed}} {{services on}} High Speed 1 are operated by Southeastern. Having been in planning since 2004, a preview {{service of the}} British Rail Class 395 trains, popularly known as Javelins, started in June 2009, and regular services began on 13 December 2009. The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes, compared with 80 minutes for <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> London Charing Cross via Tonbridge. This service on Section 2 of the CTRL, known previously as CTRL-DS, {{was a factor in}} London's successful 2012 Olympic Bid, promising a seven-minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras. Although the Class 395 has a maximum speed of , for timetabling purposes a 10% lower speed is assumed. These trains have faster acceleration than the Eurostar units.|$|E
5|$|During 1943, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{received}} 399 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft. Their arrival allowed <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> {{expand its}} combat force by forming five new Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons {{to join the}} three squadrons that had operated the type in the South West Pacific area since 1942. No.82 Squadron was formed at Bankstown, New South Wales, on 18June 1943. It was the third of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established, following No.84 Squadron in February and No.86 Squadron in March; No.78 Squadron was formed in July and No.80 Squadron in September. Commanded by Squadron Leader Stanley Galton, No.82 Squadron's original complement was 279, including fifteen officers. It {{was to have been}} equipped wholly with P-40M Kittyhawks but initially included a flight of Bell P-39 Airacobras. No.82 Squadron conducted training at Bankstown until April 1944, when personnel briefly moved to Hughes Airfield in the Northern Territory, before being redeployed to Townsville, Queensland, for further training.|$|E
5|$|Following George Trice's {{death in}} 1933, {{control of the}} {{business}} passed to his son, also called George. A coach hire and excursion business had been introduced in July 1931; this was split out into a new company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently until 1955. From the early 1930s, until 1964, <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Peaslake was run jointly with the London Passenger Transport Board; operation of the entire route was taken over in August 1964, but falling passenger numbers meant that the route was cut back in frequency a year later.

5|$|In May 1976, the company's {{long-established}} route between Guildford and Peaslake {{was extended}} to Cranleigh via Ewhurst, and a once-daily schoolday service to and from The Haven, the first bus route to serve the community, was introduced. A number of service changes saw Tillingbourne vehicles operating to Croydon and Chichester {{one day a week}} each by 1977, although both were withdrawn after three years. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Colgate was withdrawn and replaced by a local half-hourly route in Horsham in 1979. In September 1980, the company moved depots again to a larger site in Cranleigh.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Tasmania, Whitemore no longer has {{passenger}} rail transport; the last Tasmanian passenger rail service stopped in 1978 and <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Whitemore prior to that. Rail transport for Whitemore opened in the late 1870s. The first passenger train was on 27 April 1870 and the rail line opened for regular traffic in February 1871. This transport was from a siding rather than a station. The Whitemore siding did not have a full-time station master and was not a regular stop; passengers had to request the train stop or flag the train for a pickup. The town’s only regular transport services as of 2014 are Redline Coaches' private school-bus services.|$|E

Some town services and those to Sand Bay, Wells, Burnham-on-Sea and Bristol Airport start from or run via the main railway station. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> Sand Bay is sometimes operated by an open top bus.

5|$|One of the {{helicopters}} {{was bought by}} Widerøe in December 1976 and the operations were subcontracted to Offshore Helicopters. The second Sikorsky was bought from Helilift in March 1978 and also operated by Offshore Helicopters. Helikopter Service merged with Offshore Helicopters in 1980, and the new Helikopter Service took over the route. They introduced an eleven-seat Bell 212 helicopters from 1 January 1982 {{because of the high}} maintenance costs of the S-58Ts. In 1982 <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> both islands handled 7,145 passengers and three tonnes of post and cargo, and made 744 landings. It received subsidies for NOK4 million.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks.

Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E
