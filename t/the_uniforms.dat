5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Uniforms</b> of the Confederate States {{military}} forces were <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> {{used by the}} Confederate Army and Navy during the American Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The uniform initially varied greatly due {{to a variety of}} reasons, such as location, limitations on the supply of cloth and other materials, State regulations that were different from the standard regulations, and the cost of materials during the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1705, {{the inmates}} of the Newcastle House of Correction were {{commissioned}} to produce 'purple and grey cloth' for <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> of the widows of the Holy Jesus Hospital.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} controversies {{about some of}} the exact details of a few of <b>the</b> <b>uniforms,</b> since some of the records were lost or {{destroyed}} after the Civil War ended.|$|E
50|$|Since the ULC first {{convened in}} 1892, it has {{produced}} more than 300 uniform acts. These acts focus on commercial law, family and domestic relations law, estates, probate and trusts, real estate, alternate dispute resolution, and many {{other areas of the}} law. Among the ULC's most widely adopted acts are <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Commercial Code, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Anatomical Gift Act, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Trade Secrets Act, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Interstate Family Support Act, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Electronic Transactions Act, and <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Transfers to Minors Act.|$|R

50|$|Upon {{joining the}} Bears organization, Bears forward Johann Kroll was already wearing <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> #4 and then goaltender Semyon Varlamov was already wearing <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> #40 (at <b>the</b> time), {{therefore}} Oreskovic chose to wear <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> #32. Oreskovic wore <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> #4 with <b>the</b> Brampton Battalion, Owen Sound Attack, Columbia Inferno and the Toronto Marlies, and wore <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> #40 with <b>the</b> Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|R
5|$|When {{head coach}} Paul Johnson {{was hired in}} 2008, the Yellow Jackets adopted a new uniform style. One year later, <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> were altered to change the yellow to gold. A year after that, <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> were altered again. This time, the team adopted {{separate}} white uniforms for both home and away games, while retaining the previous styles' navy and gold jerseys for occasions when the Yellow Jackets could not wear white at home.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{changed its name}} from the Winia to the Halla <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> had colored {{shoulders}} removed from them. The current home jerseys feature a solid blue background with yellow stripes on the cuffs and bottom of the body {{as well as a number}} of blue rough shapes behind the gold trim as well as sponsor logos on the shoulders. The away jerseys feature a solid white background with dark blue striped borders on the cuffs and bottom of the body, it also contains the same rough blue shapes behind the trim. The Halla put the first name of Korean players on the jerseys to avoid confusion as several players share the same family name.|$|E

5|$|The Brunswickers {{were awarded}} various nicknames by their contemporaries, {{including}} the Black Crows, the Black Legion and the Black Horde. However, although <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> {{of the individual}} units that comprised the corps were, as the names suggest, predominantly black, they varied in their details.|$|E
5|$|Bezen Perrot enacted {{operations}} in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It {{took part in}} the arrests of Jews, Service du travail obligatoire evaders and resistance fighters. Their knowledge of the Breton language proved to be a prized possession, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> of Waffen-SS, lacking any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.|$|E
5|$|Cadet George Washington Street was {{identified}} as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported black and light blue striped jerseys and caps, with white pants and blue socks. The Naval Academy wore maroon socks, caps, and belts, with white pants and jerseys. Both teams also nailed strips of leather {{to the bottom of}} their shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|E
50|$|Since its organization, the ULC has drafted {{more than}} 300 uniform laws on {{numerous}} subjects and in various fields of law, setting patterns for uniformity across the nation. Today, the Commission is recognized primarily for its work in commercial law, family law, real property law, {{the law of}} probate and estates, the law of business organizations, health law, and conflicts of law; it rarely drafts regulatory law. <b>Uniform</b> acts include <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Probate Code, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Partnership Act, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Anatomical Gift Act, <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Limited Partnership Act, and <b>the</b> <b>Uniform</b> Interstate Family Support Act.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>uniform</b> of <b>the</b> former Hwa Chong Junior College was {{designed}} by a Malay female student (one of the pioneer batch of students who graduated from HCJC in 1975), and is a distinct feature of HCJC. <b>The</b> <b>uniform</b> for male students comprise a beige shirt featuring two shirt pockets, a identity of <b>the</b> <b>uniform,</b> complemented with long beige trousers. <b>The</b> <b>uniform</b> for female students comprise a beige blouse and a beige skirt. <b>The</b> same <b>uniform</b> was retained as <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> for <b>the</b> college section of Hwa Chong Institution.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, the French Army was wearing <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> of <b>the</b> Franco-Prussian War of 1870, but <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> was unsuited to the trenches, and so in 1915 the French Army replaced <b>the</b> <b>uniform,</b> with <b>the</b> Adrian helmet replacing <b>the</b> képi. A <b>uniform</b> with a , of bleu-horizon colour adopted to the trenches, was adopted, and <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> for colonial soldiers coloured khaki.|$|R
5|$|Cadet George Washington Street, of Wisconsin, was {{identified}} as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley, of Pennsylvania, was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported blue, black, and white striped uniforms, while the Naval Academy wore maroon and white uniforms. Both teams also nailed strips of leather {{to the bottom of}} their shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|E
5|$|During the season, the Giants {{honored the}} {{memories}} of two of their former players on their uniforms. A helmet sticker with the number 38 was added to <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> after John Tuggle, a former running back the Giants selected as the final pick of the 1983 draft, died of angiosarcoma in August 1986. After former defensive back and two-time Pro Bowler Spider Lockhart died of lymphoma in July 1986, a patch with Lockhart's nickname and number {{were added to the}} jerseys and the Giants wore both the sticker and the jersey patch the whole season.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Drukair {{introduced}} a new uniform for its flight attendants, consisting of a contemporary kira and tego. <b>The</b> <b>uniforms</b> were introduced for the centenary celebrations of the monarchy, {{as well as the}} airlines own silver jubilee. The uniform was chosen by way of a competition in which five Bhutanese fashion designers submitted entries, with the winner receiving a BTN 75,000 prize. The textiles used in the new uniform were chosen via a competition which was jointly organised by Drukair and the United Nations Development Programme to promote the Bhutanese textile industry and culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Artillery uniforms were a variety of {{handmade}} and personally customized uniforms. By 1862, the Confederate uniforms became organized. They became cadet gray and were to be lined {{with a layer of}} red around the sleeve. The pant legs were light blue. Even after <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> were organized many of the artillerymen wore regular clothes due to the heat and discomfort caused by the regular uniforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{insignia}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps was the Maltese Cross. The patch {{was worn}} {{on the left}} shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> and on the student nurse uniform of the official school of nursing. The USPHS official insignia was worn on jacket lapels and was also present on the silver buttons. On the Montgomery beret, the USPHS insignia was worn beneath the spread eagle and the American Shield.|$|E
5|$|The series {{borrowed}} <b>the</b> <b>uniforms,</b> cheerleaders, {{fans and}} stadium of the Pflugerville Panthers. Producers shot Pflugerville games {{and used them}} as game footage in the series. University of Southern California football announcers Peter Arbogast and Paul McDonald provided off-screen commentary during the football game sequences. The facilities, colors and bobcat logos of Texas State University in San Marcos were used as the setting and creative inspiration for the fictional Texas Methodist University. The show features the fictional Herrmann Field, named for George Herrmann, the {{head coach of the}} Pflugerville Panthers.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} isohedral {{pentagonal}} tilings generated as duals of <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> tilings, those with 5-valence vertices. They represent special higher symmetry {{cases of the}} 15 monohedral tilings above. Uniform tilings and their duals are all edge-to-edge. These dual tilings are also called Laves tilings. The symmetry of <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> dual tilings {{is the same as}} <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> tilings. Because <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> tilings are isogonal, the duals are isohedral.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> {{data model}} to reason about relational data and meta-data query processing. The principal property of <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> data model {{is that both}} meta-data and data are organized in uniformly shaped information objects. This uniform treatment of meta-data and data allows {{for the design of}} query languages that are independent of the meta-data/data separation. We present two query languages that are designed in this manner: <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> calculus and <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> algebra, which are a logical and algebraic query languages, respectively, for <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> data model. We establish that <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> calculus has at least the expressive power of <b>the</b> <b>uniform</b> algebra and prove that, besides providing meta-data query processing capabilities, these languages can efficiently simulate conventional relational query languages. We also give upper-bounds on the expressive power of these languages and since these languages have higher data complexity than the relational calculus and algebra, w [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Tipu's Tiger was {{originally}} made for Tipu Sultan (also {{referred to as}} Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth-century literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of Karnataka) around 1795. Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces. His throne rested upon a probably similar life-size wooden tiger, covered in gold; like other valuable treasures it was broken up for the highly organised prize fund shared out between the British army.|$|E
5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through <b>the</b> <b>uniforms,</b> causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer {{a few feet from the}} gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{was first}} practiced in simple {{form in the}} mid 18th century by jäger- or rifle units. Their tasks {{required}} them to be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more accurate weapons, especially the repeating rifle, camouflage was adopted for <b>the</b> <b>uniforms</b> of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern camouflage textiles address visibility not only to visible light but also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. Camouflage is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell {{can be used to}} target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. Some forms of camouflage have elements of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital camouflage patterns made of pixels.|$|E
