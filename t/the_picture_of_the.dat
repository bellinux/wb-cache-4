5|$|Due to the {{information}} offered by the Greek epics and especially by Homer's epics, the Iliad and Odyssey, this time period of Greek history {{was regarded as a}} period of warrior-heroes who led various military campaigns in Greece and adjacent areas. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mycenaean Greeks in the Homeric Epics is one of a quarrelsome people and of a warrior élite to whom personal honor was the highest value.|$|E
5|$|Several special {{editions of}} The Black Parade were released. One bears white text {{on a black}} background, and the second has black text on a white background.

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 12, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with theater advertisements appearing in Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Washington D. C., Washington state, and North Carolina. Some advertisements were ambiguous in whether or not <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play was being performed, as one Bell Theatre advertisement shows.|$|E
5|$|As {{the nineteenth}} century progressed, there were several other {{important}} observations about the genealogical structure of the Catalogue. In 1860 Adolf Kirchhoff noted the mass of information connected {{to the family of}} Io, a stemma which could be assigned to the third book because of an ancient citation placing Phineus, one of her descendents, there. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catalogue that was emerging began to resemble the Bibliotheca in structure, but Theodor Bergk was the first to suggest explicitly (though in passing) that the poem might be reconstructed {{with the help of the}} mythographic work. Bergk and his contemporaries still largely followed Marckscheffel's conclusion that the Catalogue and Ehoiai were semi-distinct texts, and it was not until 1894 that Friedrich Leo finally demonstrated that these were in fact alternate titles for a single poem.|$|E
5|$|The British and German ad {{program for}} an LTO variant called the Cheesy Bacon XXL {{featured}} an edited {{version of the}} Manthem commercial created by Crispin Porter + Bogusky that was originally used for the company's LTO Texas Double Whopper. The line mentioning the Whopper was edited out and replaced and <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product was digitally replaced {{with one of the}} Cheesy Bacon XXL. The ad was sung entirely in English; all signage, including road signs license plates on vehicles, etc., was not translated into German.|$|E

5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{with the}} finds from the {{salvaged}} Mary Rose itself have {{provided an opportunity}} to compare {{the accuracy of the}} records provided in the Roll. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible {{because of the lack of}} an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} this mystification {{lies in the}} {{excitement}} brought to Europe by the legendary tales, especially those by Leo Africanus: Arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent cities in the Timbuktu region, such as Gao and Walata.

25|$|Represented by a Smiley logo as the {{campaign}} kick started, the National Courtesy Campaign had Singa the Courtesy Lion replace the Smiley logo in 1982.

In addition, using the race-neutral lion overcame the issue of racial representation.|$|E

25|$|In the 12th {{century the}} process of {{creation}} of the knighthood began in Poland (and lasted more than a century), which was strictly connected with a tenure of land. In order to recreate <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army of those times, {{it is essential to}} know the duties of particular classes of society: military duty, specified works for army's needs duty and services in kind for the army duty. The first type of duty rested mainly in soldiers' hands. The other two were the responsibility of the burghers and (most of) the peasants.|$|E

Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family who lose their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. They are never quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph.|$|E
25|$|Most {{suspension}} bridges have open truss {{structures to}} support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) bridge collapse. Recent developments in bridge aerodynamics have allowed the re-introduction of plate structures first seen on the Severn bridge built in the 1960s. In <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yichang Bridge, note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, {{such as those that}} destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.|$|E
