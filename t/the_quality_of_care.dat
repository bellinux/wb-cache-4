25|$|KP's {{quality of}} care has been highly rated and {{attributed}} to {{a strong emphasis on}} preventive care, its doctors being salaried rather than paid per service, and an attempt to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay.

25|$|Piedmont Sanatorium School of Tuberculosis Nursing, {{a two-year}} nursing school for black women, was founded {{shortly after the}} Sanatorium opened. It allowed the black women to become {{certified}} specifically in tuberculosis nursing; a third year of training at St. Phillips Hospital in Richmond was {{required in order to}} become a Registered Nurse. The school became the subject of controversy due to the hospital staffing shortages of World War II. In 1943, Virginia Governor Colgate W.

25|$|Animals in zoos often exhibit {{behaviors}} that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. These are usually indicative of stress. For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around {{the limits of their}} enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers. Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> towards the animals. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.|$|E
25|$|A {{survey of}} 6,000 primary care doctors in seven {{countries}} revealed disparities {{in several areas}} that affect quality of care. Differences did not follow trends {{of the cost of}} care; primary care physicians in the United States lagged behind their counterparts in other countries, {{despite the fact that the}} US spends two to three times as much per capita. Arrangements for after-hours care were almost twice as common in the Netherlands, Germany and New Zealand as in Canada and the United States, where patients must rely on emergency facilities. Other major disparities include automated systems to remind patients about follow-up care, give patients test results or warn of harmful drug interactions. There were differences as well among primary care doctors, regarding financial incentives to improve <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
25|$|A recent ABC-TV 20/20 {{report on}} Healthcare, based on footage taken {{from within the}} island, criticized Michael Moore's portrayals of the Cuban Healthcare system in the movie Sicko. In that film, Moore took a number of Americans to a {{hospital}} in Havana where they bought affordable drugs, and were given treatments for free that they could not afford in America. The report highlights the dilapidated conditions of some hospitals that are accessible to regular Cubans by pointing to the bleak conditions of hospital rooms and the filthy conditions of the facilities. The report also addressed <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> available to Cubans by arguing that patient neglect was a common phenomenon. Finally, in discussing the infant mortality rate, the report highlights the government's alleged efforts to promote abortions of potentially infirm fetuses and other alleged government efforts to manipulate the rate.|$|E

25|$|CPOE {{systems can}} take years to install and configure. Despite ample {{evidence}} of the potential to reduce medication errors, adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States has been slowed by resistance to changes in physician's practice patterns, costs and training time involved, and concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards. According {{to a study by}} RAND Health, the US healthcare system could save more than 81 billion dollars annually, reduce adverse medical events and improve <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> if it were to widely adopt CPOE and other health information technology. As more hospitals become aware of the financial benefits of CPOE, and more physicians with a familiarity with computers enter practice, increased use of CPOE is predicted. Several high-profile failures of CPOE implementation have occurred, so a major effort must be focused on change management, including restructuring workflows, dealing with physicians' resistance to change, and creating a collaborative environment.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the U.S. federal {{government}} took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended {{ideas of the}} Consumers' Bill of Rights with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken {{in an effort to}} ensure <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> of all patients by preserving the integrity of the processes that occur in the healthcare industry. Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many interest groups, including the American Medical Association (AMA) and Big Pharma came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of health insurance status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all harm done proved to be the two biggest stumbling blocks for the bill. As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass Congress in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Hospitals in {{this era}} {{were the first to}} require medical diplomas to license doctors. The {{licensing}} test was administered by the region's government appointed chief medical officer. The test had two steps; the first was to write a treatise, on the subject the candidate wished to obtain a certificate, of original research or commentary of existing texts, which they were encouraged to scrutinize for errors. The second step was to answer questions {{in an interview with the}} chief medical officer. Physicians worked fixed hours and medical staff salaries were fixed by law. For regulating <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and arbitrating cases, it is related that if a patient dies, their family presents the doctor's prescriptions to the chief physician who would judge if the death was natural or if it was by negligence, in which case the family would be entitled to compensation from the doctor. The hospitals had male and female quarters while some hospitals only saw men and other hospitals, staffed by women physicians, only saw women. While women physicians practiced medicine, many largely focused on obstetrics.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{socioeconomic}} factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities {{in health and}} access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences in <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant {{in the level of}} quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts. This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.|$|E
