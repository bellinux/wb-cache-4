[...] It follows that the relation defined {{in this way is}} only a partial order. [...] To get around this, we have to specify which positions matter. Since there are infinitely many indices, we don't want finite sets of indices to matter. A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free ultrafilter U on the natural numbers; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets. (The good news is that Zorn's lemma guarantees the existence of many such U; <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they cannot be explicitly constructed.) We think of U as singling out those sets of indices that [...] "matter": We write (a0, a1, a2, ...) ≤ (b0, b1, b2, ...) if and only if the set of natural numbers { n : a'n ≤ b'n } is in U.|$|E
2500|$|After the Obama {{administration}} reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties {{reduced their}} immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found [...] "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, {{a measure of}} policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led {{to an increase in}} policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police." [...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates. <b>The</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero." ...|$|E

Barney sets forth {{what might be called}} the ‘bad news’ about resource valuation: in general it is difﬁcult to purchase things for less than they are worth. The interests of both the seller and rivals should stand in the way of such an accomplishment.

2500|$|In {{an essay}} written {{specifically}} {{in answer to}} the biography, noted Wilson biographer John Milton Cooper offers his perspective, including this overarching comment: [...] "The quality of the writing in the book, the pleasure in reading it, and the warm human impression it leaves of its subject are the good news. <b>The</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the book leaves out much that it ought to include and includes some that it ought to leave out." [...] As {{an example of what}} he felt should have been included, Cooper notes [...] "In spite of the book’s strength in depicting Wilson’s family life, it is also oddly unsatisfactory about one of its most important figures: his father." [...] As another example, Cooper states that [...] "Equally glaring is the lack of attention to Wilson’s thought." [...] Cooper questions Berg's inclusion of the memories of Wilson wife by saying [...] "Kristie Miller’s excellent biography of Wilson’s two wives could have raised red flags about Edith’s memory." [...] Cooper not only disputes Berg's framing of Wilson's racism but also his religious perspective, calling into question the use of Bible quotations {{at the beginning of each}} chapter: [...] "Other reviewers have found this practice tiresome; I found it unenlightening and strange." [...] Cooper ends by saying [...] "To sum up, this biography has much to recommend it, especially the pleasure it affords in reading it. Its shortcomings make it far from balanced or comprehensive, much less “definitive." ...|$|E
