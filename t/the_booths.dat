5|$|Preparation {{work on the}} free-flow scheme {{started in}} April 2014. Concerns were raised about reliability, with a Highways Agency report {{predicting}} that it could lose up to £6m of unpaid charges per year. In September, the Highways Agency announced that the new scheme would start to operate {{at the end of}} November, though related works to remove barriers would continue until April 2015. Subsequently, the date for removal of <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> was confirmed as 30 November.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant is a theme {{restaurant}} at Disney's Hollywood Studios, {{one of the}} four main theme parks at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, United States. Established in May 1991, the restaurant is modeled after a 1950s drive-in theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.|$|E
5|$|Acoli {{then drove}} the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol cars and <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, {{fled into the}} woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's {{body was found in}} a nearby gully along the road.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two primary}} camera angles {{used during the}} video. The first angle comes from just outside <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> and oversees <b>the</b> members {{entrance}} into <b>the</b> <b>booth.</b> <b>The</b> other angle comes from inside <b>the</b> <b>booth,</b> filming <b>the</b> member {{in front of a}} curtain. The first angle is used exclusively until 2:27 when the second angle becomes used exclusively.|$|R
5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, the coffins were reburied {{elsewhere}} {{within the}} Arsenal. In February 1869, after much pleading from <b>the</b> <b>Booths</b> and Surratts, President Johnson agreed {{to turn the}} bodies over to their families.|$|E

50|$|The phone {{became a}} {{sensation}} on the Internet in 1997. A Los Angeles man spotted a telephone icon {{on a map}} of the Mojave and decided to visit it. He wrote a letter about his adventure to an underground magazine and included <b>the</b> <b>booth's</b> telephone number. Godfrey Daniels, a local computer entrepreneur, read the letter and started the first of several websites devoted to <b>the</b> Mojave telephone <b>booth.</b> Soon fans began calling <b>the</b> <b>booth,</b> and a few took trips to <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> to answer, often camping out at the site. Several callers kept recordings of their conversations. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> became covered in graffiti left by visitors.|$|R
50|$|This is the 2nd Time Jill {{gets to be}} in <b>the</b> <b>booth.</b> <b>The</b> 1st {{time was}} in S1E07, when she {{accepted}} her Wipey. This time, she was replacing John Henson as a temporary commentator in <b>the</b> <b>booth,</b> while he became a sideline reporter.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, a re-organization took place. Until then, {{there were}} games of skittles, large dance floors, and trees for {{climbing}} in the beer booths.

25|$|Statues {{of each of}} <b>the</b> <b>Booths</b> by George Edward Wade were erected on Champion Hill in London, next to the Salvation Army's {{training}} college in London in 1929.

25|$|Sir Ralph Staley (descendant of the de Stavelegh family) had no male heirs but an only {{daughter}}, Elizabeth Staley, {{who married}} Sir Thomas Assheton and united the manors of Ashton and Staley. Elizabeth and Thomas had {{two daughters and}} no sons. Margaret, the eldest of their two daughters, married Sir William Booth of Dunham Massey. The younger daughter Elizabeth was widowed and without children, and continued to live at Staley Hall until her death in 1553. In her will her share of the lordships of Staley and Ashton were left to <b>the</b> <b>Booths.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Domesday Book {{there is}} a {{reference}} to a priest at Great Budworth. The church and its living were given to the Augustinian canons of Norton Priory by William FitzNigel, Constable of Chester and Baron of Halton in 1130. Geoffrey de Dutton was an early benefactor of the church, as later were <b>the</b> <b>Booths</b> of Twemlow. The oldest part of the present church, the Lady Chapel, dates from the 14thcentury; the rest of the church from the 15th and 16thcenturies. Rowland Egerton-Warburton of Arley Hall paid for a restoration of the church in the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the Dartford Crossing {{construction}} {{debt was}} paid off, {{which should have}} resulted in the scrapping of the toll fee to cross. However, the government decided to continue to charge most crossing users to keep congestion levels down. Ironically, since the upgrading of the crossing doubled capacity in terms of road lanes, but did not add extra toll booths, it is the toll booths themselves that are responsible for lengthy queues at peak times, and removal of <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> would almost certainly reduce congestion. As with congestion charging schemes, all proceeds must be used for transport purposes. In one year this money amounted to £60 million.|$|E

25|$|Although the SAM {{supported}} commerce, by arranging products by type {{rather than}} by brand it helped visitors compare features and prices. The Salon organizers tried to impose some degree of uniformity on the display stands, but there was naturally competition by the vendors to attract attention through taller and more original stands. To counteract this, all displays had to meet standards and be approved by a committee. There was some social segregation. The displays of inexpensive small items in the basement from 1956 tended to be fairly chaotic, with visitors {{able to pick up}} and examine the products, while <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> upstairs showing the larger and more expensive items were calmer and more elegant.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} {{institution in the}} city is the market. There are four traditional markets with the {{most important}} of these located just off the main square. The main market building was built by the city in 1970, with booths in this market now worth as much as $30,000 pesos. The owners of <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> pay a small trust fee which is used for public works projects. These are supplemented by tianguis markets in the Guichivere neighborhood on Wednesdays and one in Reoloteca neighborhood on Sundays. The market is the center of nearly all commerce in the city, with 95% of the goods small enough to carry sold there. As a result, the city lacks department, electronics, clothing, jewelry and other types of stores.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the Irish general election, 1918, the Camlough Company of the Irish Volunteers {{travelled}} {{by train}} from Newry to Carlingford. On arrival, they found large numbers of Carlingford inhabitants wearing Union Jacks. The Volunteers ordered all the Royal Irish Constabulary men they saw on duty on the streets or at the polling booths to return to their barracks and to remain in them whilst the Volunteers were in Carlingford. A series of attacks were made on the Volunteers from by mobs on the streets. The Volunteers took control and sought to protect voters going to record their votes until the polling booths closed. Seamus Lyang from Dundalk was polling clerk in Carlingford and when <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> closed the Volunteers had to take Lyang under their protection and escort him out of the Carlingford. All the pubs and shops in Carlingford were hostile to the Volunteers and refused to serve them. After the closing of the poll, the Volunteers marched back to Camlough.|$|E

25|$|Vehicles {{then proceed}} from the Highway 34 {{entrance}} {{north to the}} main gate via Gate Road, a desert dirt road with a speed limit of 10mph. All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass, and all occupants are required to have valid ticket, {{in order to get}} in. Vehicles are also searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at Will Call, <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate. All tickets and vehicle passes must be bought in advance; they are not directly sold outside the gate or at the Will Call booths. Furthermore, unless they have a valid early arrival pass for the pre-event set up, any vehicle who arrives before the gate opens is turned away and told to go back to Reno, and not to wait {{along the side of the}} road on either Highways 34 or 447 (which would be a safety hazard), nor stay in Gerlach (and overcrowd the small town).|$|E
25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. <b>The</b> <b>booths</b> had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the main bar and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.|$|E
500|$|Booth {{made his}} stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855, in the {{supporting}} {{role of the}} Earl of Richmond in Richard III at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre. The audience jeered at the inexperienced actor when he missed some of his lines. He also began acting at Baltimore's Holliday Street Theater, owned by John T. Ford, where <b>the</b> <b>Booths</b> had performed frequently. In 1857, Booth joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he played for a full season. At his request, he was billed as [...] "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison {{with other members of}} his famous thespian family. Jim Bishop wrote that Booth [...] "developed into an outrageous scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him." [...] In February 1858, he played in Lucrezia Borgia at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright and stumbled over his line. Instead of introducing himself by saying, [...] "Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo", he stammered, [...] "Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet—Pedolfio Pat—Pantuchio Ped—dammit! Who am I?", causing the audience to roar with laughter.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> GSM phone <b>booth</b> was {{designed}} as a mobile phone with solar arrays on the roof.

The cell phone platform was integrated into <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> such that when a SIM card is inserted it can be used {{as if it were a}} personal phone. The SIM card holder {{was designed}} in such a way that the user carries it along to <b>the</b> phone <b>booth</b> and slots it into the provided slot on <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> before making a call. It was also designed to switch on or off <b>the</b> phone <b>booth</b> such that when the card is removed <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> is switched off while the battery continues to charge. This is another mean by which the battery life is extended. The design provides a low cost approach for extending mobile communication to rural areas and also for campuses and public area...|$|R
