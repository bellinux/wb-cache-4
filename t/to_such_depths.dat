50|$|A light-acquisition problem {{exists for}} aquatic algae since {{submergence}} can reduce light intensity and dampen photosynthesis.

A Nannochloropsis species isolated from Singapore's coastal water was investigated under different light wavelengths (red, green, blue, and white) and intensities to determine the optimal condition for biomass productivity and lipid production. The maximum fatty acid yield was achieved for both phototrophic (sunlight is the only energy source) and mixotrophic (utilize both sunlight and energy from carbon source) cultures at 55.15 and 111.96 mg/L, respectively, under cell exposure to blue light (470 nm). The biomass productivity of the algae also peaked under blue light for both cultures.|$|R

50|$|An {{incident}} occurred on 17 February 1927 which highlighted the potentially disastrous situation of having only one {{bridge across the}} Brisbane River. The cargo steamer Chronos was taken upstream by a rising tide and the bow was wedged under the Victoria Bridge. Tugs managed {{to pull it out}} eventually, but the rising tide could have dislodged a span of the bridge and dumped it in the river, and this was highlighted in the press at the time.As mentioned, the depth-to-rock over much of the length of the William Jolly Bridge posed a major problem {{in the design of the}} foundations. The original design had the piers supported on timber piles, with inclined piles to resist the thrust from the small arch. Piles were driven immediately to the south of the pier, but it became impossible to drive them into the rock and the design was changed to utilise reinforced concrete caissons (heavy, hollow, vertical reinforced concrete cylinders), and the contractor was noted as being completely in accord with this decision. The southern approach spans piers founded on timber piles all driven to rock, or <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths</b> as it was possible to drive them without damage, and the river piers are founded on reinforced concrete caissons. To achieve this the Sand Island method was invented by Manuel Hornibrook (1893-1970).|$|E
30|$|To {{assess the}} {{sensitivity}} to the initial model, we created a synthetic model using a modified PREM with a seafloor depth of 4.2  km, crustal thickness of 6.6  km, and ± 3  % uniform velocity perturbations. The results suggest that shear wave velocities at depths shallower than 50  km are not well recovered if the initial model is substantially different from the synthetic model (Fig.  6 e, f). Rayleigh waves {{in the range of}} periods analyzed are less sensitive <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths,</b> so final models resemble the initial model at shallow depths. Small misfits to the synthetic models, less than 0.03  km/s, are also observed at depths greater than 50  km, which compensate the misfits shallower than 50  km. In the present study, we focus on shear wave models at depths greater than 50  km.|$|E

But reading long volumes of these Convention Debates, all in a foam with furious earnestness, earnest many times to the extent of life and death, one is struck rather with the degree of continence they manifest in speech; and how in such wild ebullition, there is still a kind of polite rule struggling for mastery, and the forms of social life never altogether disappear. These men, though they menace with clenched right-hands, do not clench one another by the collar; they draw no daggers, except for oratorical purposes, and this not often: profane swearing is almost unknown, though the Reports are frank enough; we find only one or two oaths, oaths by Marat, reported in all.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermal evolution of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's subsurface in the Seth_ 01 region, where active pits {{have been observed}} by the ESA/Rosetta mission. Our simulations show that clathrate destabilization and amorphous ice crystallization can occur at depths corresponding {{to those of the}} observed pits in a timescale shorter than 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's lifetime in the comet's activity zone in the inner solar system. Sublimation of crystalline ice down <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths</b> is possible only {{in the absence of a}} dust mantle, which requires the presence of dust grains in the matrix small enough to be dragged out by gas from the pores. Our results are consistent with both pits formation via sinkholes or subsequent to outbursts, the dominant process depending on the status of the subsurface porosity. A sealed dust mantle would favor episodic and disruptive outgassing as a result of increasing gas pressure in the pores, while high porosity should allow the formation of large voids in the subsurface due to the continuous escape of volatiles. We finally conclude that the subsurface of 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is not uniform at a spatial scale of similar to 100 - 200 m...|$|E
40|$|Bending of oceanic plates at {{subduction}} zones {{results in}} extension and widespread normal faulting(1) in the upper, brittle {{part of the}} slab(2, 3). Detailed seismic surveys at trenches reveal that {{this part of the}} oceanic plate could be pervasively hydrated for several kilometres below the crust-mantle boundary(4 - 7). Similarly, heat-flow surveys indicate active fluid circulation within the slab(8). Yet, the mechanisms that enable fluids to percolate <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths</b> in spite of their natural buoyancy remain unclear. Here we use two-dimensional numerical experiments to show that stress changes induced by the bending oceanic plate produce subhydrostatic or even negative pressure gradients along normal faults, favouring downward pumping of fluids. The fluids then react with the crust and mantle surrounding the faults and are stored in the form of hydrous minerals. We suggest that this process is the dominant mechanism of deep slab hydration, although it may be locally aided by the enhancement in porosity due to prefailure dilatancy(9), pre-existing cracks(10) and migrating fluid-filled cracks(11). Our results have implications for the transport of water into the deeper parts of the mantle(12), and for further clarifying the seismic anisotropy of slabs(13) ...|$|E
40|$|Large {{earthquakes}} occur {{frequently in}} subduction zones. Most earthquakes are {{generated in the}} seismogenic zone, a fairly limited area confined to the shallower regions of the subduction plate boundary. To understand the processes of earthquake generation, {{it is essential to}} monitor the physical and mechanical properties of the seismogenic zone over long periods. At present, there are no deep borehole observations of the seismogenic zone more than 3 km below seafloor, because it has, until now, been impossible to penetrate <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths</b> below the sea floor. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), scheduled to begin in 2003, plans to drill boreholes beneath the ocean floor using a multiple-drilling platform operation. The IODP riser-quipped drilling ship (Chikyu) enables the emplacement of boreholes up to 0 km beneath the ocean floor, and will provide opportunities to conduct long-term deep borehole observations in the seismogenic zone. Long-term borehole observations in the seismogenic zone are expected to require the development of advanced sampling, monitoring, and recording technology. Here, we discuss the scientific objectives, engineering and technical challenges, and experimental design for a deep borehole, long-term deepborehole monitoring system aimed at understanding the processes of earthquake generation in the seismogenic zone of subduction plate boundaries. We focus specifically on the relationships between environmental conditions in the deep subsurface, details of monitoring and recording, and design and implementation of scientific tools and programs...|$|E
