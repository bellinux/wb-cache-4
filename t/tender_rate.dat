40|$|The paper models {{fixed rate}} tenders, where {{a central bank}} offers to lend central bank funds to {{financial}} institutions. Bidders are constrained {{by the amount of}} collateral they have. We focus on the strategic interaction between bidding in the tender and trading in the interbank market after the tender, where short squeezes could occur. We examine how the design of the tender affects equilibrium bidding behavior and the incidence of short squeezes. Important elements in the analysis include the type of policy implemented by the central bank as well as bidders' initial endowments of liquidity and collateral. Three instruments for softening short squeezes are identified: the <b>tender</b> <b>rate,</b> the tender sizes, and admissible collateral. Increasing the <b>tender</b> <b>rate</b> or size tends to decrease the probability and severity of a short squeeze. The possibility of a short squeeze may induce bidders to oversubscribe even if the <b>tender</b> <b>rate</b> is higher than the competitive rate...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{empirical}} {{relevance of the}} mechanisms through which the Bank of Finland's actions are transmitted to the Finnish economy. We concentrate on {{the first stage of}} the monetary policy transmission mechanism; namely, the effect of the Bank's actions on domestic market interest rates and the exchange rate. The questions we analyse include: What is the impact of a change in the Bank of Finland's one month <b>tender</b> <b>rate</b> on interest rates of longer maturities and on the exchange rate? How do Finnish interest rates and the exchange rate react to turmoil in foreign money and bond markets? To what extent can recent developments in Finnish interest rates be attributed to the Bank of Finland's policies? We find that the effect of a monetary policy shock is limited to the short end of the yield curve. Changes in the Bank of Finland's <b>tender</b> <b>rate</b> seem to signal the future path of short rates for a period of 1 - 2 years. On the other hand, Finnish bond rates appear to follow closely circumstances in the international financial market and do not seem to react systematically to changes in the Bank of Finland's <b>tender</b> <b>rate.</b> We find that monetary policy has contributed little to the large swings in Finnish bond rates experienced over the last few years. Most of the variation in bond rates can be attributed to changes in international long rates and changes in the perceived overall credibility of the Finnish economy.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{measurement}} of anticipated interest rate policy {{and the effects of}} these expectations on the term structure of nominal interest rates. It is shown that, under the expectations hypothesis, the level of long-term interest rates depends on three factors: the level of the monetary policy interest rate, ie the steering rate; the spread between the market interest rate and the steering rate; and market expectations of the next steering rate change. The theoretical model builds on the assumption that market participants have only imperfect knowledge of the mechanism whereby changes in the steering rate are determined. As a consequence, expectations formation, although realistic, need not be entirely rational. Steering rate changes take the form of discrete jumps and occur infrequently on a daily scale. Given these assumptions, discussion of the determination of the term structure is related to the literature on uncertainty about monetary policy regimes and small samples, ie "peso" problems. Empirical analysis based on Nelson–Siegel estimates of the daily yield curves in Finland in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 October 1997 complements the theoretical discussion. The observed differences between estimated market expectations and actual <b>tender</b> <b>rate</b> changes are quite large in the sample, particularly for the longer maturities. The approach applied in this study is promising, not only in the sense of potentially providing estimates of market expectations concerning future discrete changes in monetary policy interest rates but also in the sense of its apparent potential in accounting for the often reported poor empirical performance of the expectations hypothesis. term structure of interest rates; expectations; target changes; peso problems...|$|E

40|$|Most OECD {{central banks}} {{implement}} monetary policy by supplying reserves to the banking sector {{with the aim}} of influencing short-term interbank interest rates. To interpret the monetary policy stance accurately, one needs to be familiar with the mechanism for determining the money market equilibrium. The aim {{of this study is to}} deepen our understanding of the various effects of different intervention styles on the short-term money market when monetary policy is implemented with an operational framework similar to that of the European Central Bank (ECB). In the first essay of this study, we model banks' demand for central bank reserves (liquidity) for each day of an n-day reserve maintenance period and analyse liquidity determination under alternative liquidity policy rules that a central bank might apply in fixed rate tenders. It is shown that there is a tradeoff between the central bank's ability to keep a market interest rate close to the <b>tender</b> <b>rate</b> and the stability of liquidity holdings within a maintenance period. The second essay presents a model of a single bank's optimal bidding in the context of fixed rate liquidity tenders. It is shown that banks' bidding crucially depends on the central bank's liquidity policy for tender allotments. This essay also analyses ECB liquidity policy in terms of the model. The final essay models the money market equilibrium and analyses banks' bidding when the central bank uses variable rate tenders. The liquidity supply is fully endogenised by having the central bank minimise a loss function the includes deviations-from-target of interest rate and liquidity.

40|$|Upon Austria's {{entry into}} Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) took on new tasks {{in the field}} of payment systems. January 4, 1999, marked the launch of the {{cross-border}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system TARGET. This system, in which EU-wide some 5, 000 credit institutions participate, is composed of the national RTGS payment systems operated in the EU countries, the ECB Payment Mechanism (EPM) and an interface component called Interlinking. Austria's RTGS system, ARTIS, is integrated into TARGET. TARGET was designed as a real-time system, i. e., in normal circumstances payments reach their destination within a few seconds or minutes after being debited from the account of the sending participants, with all payments treated equally, irrespective of their value and destination. As a gross settlement system, TARGET guarantees intraday finality of payments, since transactions are settled individually. Throughout a business day, TARGET enables participating credit institutions to flexibly manage their liquidity, as they may use their minimum reserves for settlement purposes during the day. Banks may obtain unlimited intraday credit free of charge by providing adequate collateral, namely tier-one and tier-two assets. Euro 1 set up by the Euro Banking Association (EBA), Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) and the Paris Net Settlement (PNS) system, among others, provide key alternative channels for processing payments in euro. Compared with centralised systems, TARGET with its multitude of interfaces is more susceptible to technical incidents. Even though its fees are higher, the majority of euro-denominated payments are processed via TARGET. Starting with the January 1998 reporting period, the OeNB introduced a new balance-of-payments presentation scheme. Transactions associated with the settlement of TARGET payments are recorded under "Currency and deposits" of monetary authorities (liabilities side) under the other investment sub-account of the financial account. In the first half of 1999, such transactions ran to ATS 66. 4 billion net. This item may not, however, be explained as an opposite position of the structural current account deficit of Austria vis-à-vis the EU 15, since TARGET transactions fall predominantly under the interbank category. The capital imported via central bank payment traffic is tantamount to borrowing by the "Austrian economy" that is basically financed at most favourable (<b>tender</b> <b>rate)</b> conditions.

40|$|Open market {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in allocating central bank funds to the banking system and thereby to steer short-term interest rates in line with the stance of monetary policy. This note presents some elements of a theory of bidding in central bank tenders in a framework such as the one of the Eurosystem, i. e. with high reserve requirements and averaging and possible expectations of rate changes within the reserve maintenance period in which a tender is executed. The ECB has so far used fixed <b>rate</b> <b>tenders</b> and a variant of the variable <b>rate</b> <b>tender,</b> which may be similar to a fixed <b>rate</b> <b>tender</b> depending on market circumstances.

We model equilibrium bid behaviour in the tenders and explain the underbidding phenomenon resulting from the minimum bid rate. We also show that, when maturities of consecutive operations overlap, the expected market interest rate will rise above the CB’s target whenever a target rate change (hike or cut) is expected {{to occur in the}} same reserve maintenance period.
