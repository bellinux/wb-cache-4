5|$|The fifth {{match was}} the main event from the SmackDown brand, a {{standard}} match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At {{the beginning of the}} match, Lesnar <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away from the ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including DDT and Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon, who had accompanied Lesnar to the ring, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1849, {{stores were}} taken from a hut on Thomas Cooper Horn's station and a hutkeeper and {{shepherd}} were threatened by Aboriginal people, who left with the goods they had taken. The station owner {{and some of his}} station hands pursued the group, and when they caught up with the fleeing party of Aboriginal people shots were fired and spears thrown. The Aboriginal group split in two, and Horn and his men followed one party to the Waterloo Bay cliffs, which the group tried to climb down in order to make their escape. Horn and his men opened fire, and two Aboriginal people were killed and one was fatally wounded, with several more being captured. The Government Resident and the police inspector from Port Lincoln both wrote detailed accounts of the incident, neither of which mentioned a large number of casualties. One specified that only two Aboriginal people were killed. In September, a group of Aboriginal men were transported to Adelaide for trial. Two were convicted of the murder of Beevor, and were transported back to the Elliston district where they were hanged outside his hut. Three were charged with the murder of Easton, but were acquitted due to lack of evidence. A number of others were charged over the confrontation at the hut on Horn's station. Shortly after this, two more Aboriginal men were arrested in Port Lincoln by the police and charged with the murder of Hamp. Found guilty and sentenced to death, they were later released when doubts were raised about the testimony of Aboriginal witnesses located by the police. In February 1852 another Aboriginal male was arrested as an accomplice in Hamp's murder, but after being transported to Adelaide, he too was released due to lack of evidence. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> home to his country, and was murdered by four Aboriginal men for trespassing.|$|E
5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out on the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while they searched for a new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving coach Steve Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties for a month and oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the top table, however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held the unwanted distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E

2500|$|The {{only person}} {{to survive the}} crash was Paul Olsen, {{one of the two}} radio operators. He was sitting in the aircraft's rear in one of the Catalina's side blisters. Upon impact he was ejected [...] from the aircraft. Olsen stated that he did not recall {{anything}} from the accident and that he initially was unconscious. After waking up he tried calling to the other crew members. He then <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around, but the pain in his foot made this impossible. The aircraft was still on fire and he dared not approach it. Because of the aircraft's poor insulation, Olsen was wearing a leather jacket and a sheepskin sweater, which kept him warm until he was rescued.|$|E
2500|$|In the Third Test at Melbourne Tony Greig was {{controversially}} run {{out when}} England were 157/6. Ian Chappell had thrown {{the ball in}} from the boundary as Greig was completing his third run and Marsh caught the ball and smashed the stumps as the 6'7" [...] South African reached for the crease with his long handled bat. Photographs later showed {{that he had just}} made his ground, but Bailhache gave him out and Greig refused to go until rudely told to leave by Greg Chappell. In the Fifth Test at the Adelaide Oval Max Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee as Mike Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> to keep Walker in as he was the better batsman, but Dennis Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go as Lillee has not left his ground and the umpire agreed. Walker had trouble again (see the above quote) in the Sixth Test at Melbourne: the burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out that sent both to the ground, but Walker survived with his wicket intact. In the Third Test at Melbourne John Edrich tried to glance a ball from Ashley Mallett and was caught by Rod Marsh for 49. Bailhache gave him out, though the batsmen later said he had missed and the ball had come off his pads.|$|E
2500|$|At one Canadian service, {{hidden cameras}} showed {{a mother who}} was {{carrying}} her muscular dystrophy-afflicted daughter, Grace, being stopped by two screeners when they attempted {{to get into the}} line for a possible blessing from Hinn. The screeners asked the mother if Grace had been healed, and when the mother replied in the negative, they were told to return to their seats; the pair got out of line, but Grace, wanting [...] "Pastor Benny to pray for ," [...] asked her mother to support her as she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> as a show of [...] "her faith in action," [...] according to the mother. After several unsuccessful attempts at walking, the pair left the arena in tears, both mother and daughter visibly upset at being turned aside and crying as they explained to the undercover reporters that all Grace had wanted was for Hinn to pray for her, but the staffers rushed them out of the line when they found out Grace had not been healed. A week later at a service in Toronto, Baptist evangelist Justin Peters, who wrote his Masters in Divinity thesis on Benny Hinn and has attended numerous Hinn crusades since 2000 as part of his research for his thesis and for a seminar he developed about the Word of Faith movement entitled A Call for Discernment, also demonstrated to the hidden cameras that [...] "people who look like me"—Peters has cerebral palsy, walks with arm-crutches, and is obviously and visibly disabled—"are never allowed on stage [...] it's always somebody who has some disability or disease that cannot be readily seen." [...] Like Grace and her mother, Peters was quickly intercepted as {{he came out of the}} wheelchair section (there is one at every crusade, situated at the back of the audience, far away from the stage, and never filmed for Hinn's TV show) in an attempt to join the line of those waiting to go onstage, and was told to take a seat.|$|E

2500|$|Several months later, in February 1924, Judge Thayer {{asked one}} of the {{firearms}} experts for the prosecution, Capt. Charles Van Amburgh, to reinspect Sacco's Colt and determine its condition. With District Attorney Katzmann present, Van Amburgh took the gun from the clerk and started to take it apart. Van Amburgh quickly noticed that the barrel to Sacco's gun was brand new, being still covered in the manufacturer's protective rust preventative. Judge Thayer began private hearings to determine who had tampered with the evidence by switching the barrel on Sacco's gun. During three weeks of hearings, Albert Hamilton and Captain Van Amburgh squared off, challenging each other's authority. [...] Testimony suggested that Sacco's gun had been treated with little care, and frequently disassembled for inspection. [...] New defense attorney William Thompson insisted that no one on his side could have switched the barrels [...] "unless they wanted to run their necks into a noose." [...] Albert Hamilton swore he had only taken the gun apart while being watched by Judge Thayer. [...] Judge Thayer made no finding as to who had switched the [...]32 Colt barrels, but ordered the rusty barrel returned to Sacco's Colt. [...] After the hearing concluded, unannounced to Judge Thayer, Captain Van Amburgh took both Sacco's and Vanzetti's guns, along with the bullets and shells involved in the crime to his home where he kept them until a Boston Globe expose revealed the misappropriation in 1960. [...] Meanwhile, Van Amburgh bolstered his own credentials by writing an article on the case for True Detective Mysteries. [...] The 1935 article charged that prior to the discovery of the gun barrel switch, Albert Hamilton had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of the courtroom with Sacco's gun but was stopped by Judge Thayer. [...] Although several historians of the case, including Francis Russell, have reported this story as factual, nowhere in transcripts of the private hearing on the gun barrel switch was this incident ever mentioned. [...] The same year the True Detective article was published, a study of ballistics in the case concluded, [...] "what might have been almost indubitable evidence was in fact rendered more than useless by the bungling of the experts." ...|$|E
