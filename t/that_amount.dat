5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, {{and the role of}} experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire <b>that</b> <b>amount</b> of data.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of <b>that</b> <b>amount</b> would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

The payment per home match increases to US$550,000 in the round of 16. The prize money then increases as each quarterfinalist receives US$650,000, US$700,000 is given to each semifinalist, US$1,000,000 is awarded the runner-up, and the winner earns US$2,300,000.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{production}} of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only {{started in the}} 1870s after {{the discovery of the}} Diamond fields in South Africa. Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5billion carats have been mined since that date. About 20% of <b>that</b> <b>amount</b> has been mined in the last 5 years alone, and during the last ten years 9 new mines have started production while 4 more are waiting to be opened soon. Most of these mines are located in Canada, Zimbabwe, Angola, and one in Russia.|$|E
5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for <b>that</b> <b>amount,</b> possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E

5|$|Nauru {{and nearby}} Ocean Island were {{important}} sources of phosphate for Australian and New Zealand fertilizer production and {{played an important}} role on both countries agriculture industries at the time of World War II. The Melbourne-based British Phosphate Commission (BPC) managed the extraction and export of phosphate from the islands and dominated all aspects of Nauruan life. During the year ending 30June 1940, the BPC shipped almost a million tons of phosphate from Nauru and about half <b>that</b> <b>amount</b> from Ocean Island using its fleet of four vessels (Triadic, Triaster, Triona and Trienza) and chartered merchant ships.|$|E

CityBridge stated in a press release that the network would be free for all users, and that the service would be funded by advertisements. This advertising will provide revenue for New York City {{as well as for}} the partners involved in CityBridge. The advertising is estimated to bring in over $1 billion in profits over twelve years, with the City of New York receiving over $500 million, or about half of <b>that</b> <b>amount.</b> Technically, the LinkNYC network is intended to act as a public internet utility with advertising services.|$|E

The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdin's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3million units in its first month, but it was less than the number of copies, sold in <b>that</b> <b>amount</b> of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels.|$|E
5|$|Packer {{estimates}} {{more than}} 200 Tanzanians are killed {{each year by}} lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos, and snakes, and that the numbers could be double <b>that</b> <b>amount,</b> with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters {{not just because of}} ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts. They are {{free from the}} income tax paid by individuals and companies, and also the corporation tax paid by incorporated and unincorporated associations. There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on <b>that</b> <b>amount,</b> while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is deflected {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is deflected as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 arc seconds in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 of a degree). In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument can be made that leads to light deflection by half <b>that</b> <b>amount.</b> The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of radio astronomy, have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E
5|$|After its {{enactment}} in 1965, the law immediately decreased {{racial discrimination}} in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for {{high numbers of}} racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), {{and a majority of}} African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, <b>that</b> <b>amount</b> nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.|$|E
