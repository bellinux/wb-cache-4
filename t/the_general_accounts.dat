50|$|Dimitrios N. Levidis (Constantinople 1806 - Athens 1893), was a Greek statesman. Managed {{to escape}} the Constantinople massacres and flee to Odessa with his family, under the {{protection}} of the famous General Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, then governor of Odessa. Prince Vorontsov owed to the Levidis family, who had supported him before the Grand Vizier during an aerlier diplomatic visit to Constantinople. Levidis finished his studies in Accountancy as a bursar of Tsar Alexander I at the lycée Richelieu in Odessa, having Alexander Rizos Rangabé and Constantine Paparrigopoulos as classmates. After graduation, Levidis was under obligation to serve as officer in the Imperial Russian army, but soon persuaded the Emperor to grant him special permission to laeve the army and go to Greece, in order to join the Greek War of Independence. After Independence, he was appointed by Greek governor Ioannis Kapodistrias public commissioner in Nafplion. Later he was Chief Accountant of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Accounts</b> Office and, in 1846, Minister of Finance. Served twice as Minister of Finance at the cabinet of the Epameinondas Deligeorgis government (1876-77). He was the founder of the Political Employees Fund (TPY).|$|E

50|$|Diet {{seems to}} have been {{improved}} in the early 14th century by the same process of earmarking revenues to it. In 1332 Abbot Nicholas of Longnor, as part of a more general package of reforms, issued an ordinance on the abbey's culinary arrangements. This allocated the proceeds from the churches at Hunstanton and Ruyton XI Towns, together with those of the Dee and Severn fisheries, to the purchase of meat and fish. Longnor arranged for a new set of kitchens to be constructed:Fuel, flour, peas, cheese, butter, and pottage were still to be provided from <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>accounts.</b> Longnor also ordained a piggery:Two loads of flour were requisitioned annually for pastry. It is unclear to what extent the large quantities of meat actually formed part of the monastic diet, as there was also an infirmary on the premises and this must have absorbed some of the food supplies. The kitchener was ordered to render account to the abbot four times a year. A cellarer was responsible for the supply of both beer and bread, including that required at the abbey's granges. the abbot ate from the same kitchens as the canons and could feed guests free of charge when on the premises, but he, the steward and the chaplain were to feed themselves when away from the abbey. Abbot Longnor established a substantial garden at the abbey and in later centuries a dovecote was installed there, providing another convenient source of meat.|$|E

40|$|My main {{aim is to}} {{contribute}} to the exploration {{of the nature of the}} epistemic state of understanding. It seems that the most productive way in which this might be done is by (i) investigating what sort of conditions must be fulfilled in order for one to understand, and (ii) comparing understanding’s place in certain contemporary debates to the place that knowledge has in those debates. Regarding conditions for understanding, I will argue that there are two types of understanding that are most relevant to epistemology—objectual understanding and atomistic understanding. I will contend that atomistic understanding is entirely factive while objectual understanding is moderately factive, that objectual understanding admits of degrees, that both types involve some sort of grasp of explanatory relations, that both possess a measure of luck immunity, and that both are cognitive achievements with instrumental, teleological, contributory and (crucially) final value. It must be stressed that <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>accounts</b> of both types of understanding that I attempt to provide are not supposed to be exhaustive sets of necessary and sufficient conditions—I remain particularly open to the possibility that there are further necessary conditions that are as yet undiscovered, especially for objectual understanding. Regarding understanding’s place in contemporary debates, it is perplexing that existing work does not capitalise on the thought that treating understanding in conjunction with many of the most prominent issues in recent epistemology is a worthwhile project that could yield interesting and important results. I will summarise understanding's potential significance for a number of these topics, looking at all of the following (in varying degrees of detail) : factivity, coherentism, norms of assertion, the transmission of epistemic properties, epistemic luck, the nature of cognitive achievement, and epistemic value. This last topic is one that I think is particularly important to an investigation into understanding, because it is quite plausible that there is a particularly strong revisionist theory of epistemic value focused on understanding. Such a view would be one on which knowledge is not finally valuable, but one by way of which we could nonetheless explain why we might pre-theoretically think that knowledge is finally valuable. Since revisionist views often involve a claim that we should think of a different, closely related epistemic state as distinctively valuable, it is natural to consider understanding as a prime candidate for the focus of such a theory.

40|$|Housing finance {{system have}} been constituting {{one of the}} major fields of the welfare state system which should {{ultimately}} produce the affordable housing in every advanced countries. But at the same time, housing finance markets have been attracting public attention {{as one of the most}} drastically changing markets where financial liberalization and the securitization accompanied with structural transformation of the financial system. In such field, how the structural changes of economic and financial circumstances have affected the welfare state system and the crisis management policies? What are the feature of the new developments of welfare state system and the crisis management policies? And how should we appreciate the characteristics and perspectives of the welfare state mixes composed of public and private entities in Japan and the U. S. ? This paper examines how has the government roles in housing finance markets been changing on the process of the financial liberalization and the securitization in Japan and the United States. In the consideration of the government roles in such filed, it is needless to say that effectiveness of the government intervention should be essential to examine, but yielding such study to Professor Gary Dymski in this same series of this discussion papers, this paper focuses on the differences and its backgrounds of the forms of government intervention in the housing finance markets, and the costs of the government intervention through the process of financial liberalization and securitization from the view points of comparison of Japan and the U. S. Section 1 surveys, at first, the general trends of the broader welfare state system which can be commonly seen in the most of advanced countries. And in the Section 2, after examining the framework of the housing welfare state system focusing on the reasons and forms of the government intervention in the housing markets, differences of the government roles and their back ground in Japan and the U. S. are made clear, that is, in the U. S,, because of the existence of traditionally specialized private financial institutions in the markets affected the indirect and multiply intervention forms of the government into the markets, whereas, in Japan, government direct loan programs are given much weight because of the lack of the private housing finance institutions. And in Section 3, reorganization of the government programs are surveyed in both countries, and presented that, in the U. S., further indirect interventions were seeked on the process of financial liberalization and securitization, but paradoxical expansion of the government coverage on the market which resulted in the heavy fiscal burdens since 1980 s, whereas, in Japan, steady enlargement of the interest rate subsidies from <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>accounts</b> of the central government to the government lending agencies have appeared linking to the business cycle countermeasure policies of the government. Through such considerations, this paper concludes that different courses to reorganize the government programs have not produced the much difference in the social costs, and moreover income reallocation system through the public sector can not be abolished as long as the some external economies or ‘the attempts to shed light on {{one of the major}} aspects of today 2 ̆ 7 s changing welfare state system and crisis management policies...|$|E
