5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} started {{moving away from}} the {{automobile}} and towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the Link light rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington opened on March 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north, Des Moines to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023. Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{a severe}} fiscal crisis after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bloomberg {{introduced}} a $3 billion <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of}} the fiscal 2003 year. The move is credited with stabilizing the city's finances, which since recovered. Some critics, however, opined that he should have instead sought to cut government spending instead of raising taxes.|$|E

25|$|Critics, {{including}} some conservatives, complained that Romney was using these fees increases as a <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> disguise after having promised {{he would not}} raise taxes. Romney said that the fees were distinct from taxes because fees were charged for particular services provided whereas taxes were assessed more broadly, without expectation of any specific services — although critics noted that this explanation applied to {{only some of the}} fees Romney proposed.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2007 {{interview}} with Yevgeny Shevchuk, the then-speaker of the Transnistrian Supreme Council, Transnistria is {{in a difficult}} economic situation. Despite a 30% <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 2007, the pension fund is still lacking money and emergency measures must be taken. However, Shevchuk mentioned {{that the situation is}} not hopeless and it cannot be considered a crisis, as a crisis means three-month delays in payment of pensions and salaries.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1953, tolls {{were charged}} on the Hart, Mathews, Fuller Warren and the Main Street bridges {{to pay for}} bridge construction, renovations and many other highway projects. As Jacksonville grew, toll plazas created {{bottlenecks}} and caused delays and accidents during rush hours. In 1988, Jacksonville voters chose to eliminate toll collection and replace the revenue with a ½ cent local sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase.</b> <b>In</b> 1989, the toll booths were removed.|$|E
25|$|In the November 2012 general elections, voters {{approved}} Brown's proposed <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of}} Proposition 30. Prop 30 raised the state personal income <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> over seven years for California residents with an annual income over US$250,000 and <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> the state sales tax by 0.25 percent over four years. It allowed the state to avoid nearly $6 billion in cuts to public education.|$|R

25|$|In 1994, Hayworth ran in {{what was}} then the 6th District and {{defeated}} incumbent Democrat Karan English, taking 54 percent of the vote to English's 42 percent. Hayworth criticized English's support for Bill Clinton's budget plan, which Hayworth termed the largest <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> history. English had been endorsed in her successful 1992 campaign by the former Arizona Republican icon Barry Goldwater when she ran against Doug Wead, but not in 1994 when she ran against Hayworth.|$|E
25|$|The New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies, {{and other}} devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never {{completely}} {{gave up trying to}} balance the budget. Between 1933 and 1941 the average federal budget deficit was 3% per year. Roosevelt did not fully utilize deficit spending. The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 1932, whose full effects for the first time were felt in 1933, and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians like Paul Krugman the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run {{as it was in the}} long run.|$|E
25|$|The Lee County Board of Education has {{announced}} plans to close Beattyville Elementary and transfer the students to Southside Elementary. To accommodate the influx of students, an expansion of the facilities at Southside will be required. The decision was not popular with residents of the community The Board of Education exhausted its bonding capacity to fund the addition to Southside, so it proposed a <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 2013 to fund other repairs at other facilities. Residents of the county signed a petition to place the tax increase on the ballot. The school board decided to delay the implementation of the tax until 2014 so as not to have to pay approximately $20,000 to fund a special election. The school board passed the tax in 2014 and again, a petition was filed placing the matter on the ballot for the fall 2014 general election. The proposed tax increase was defeated by a large margin at the polls.|$|E

500|$|... "Arguably, {{the single}} most {{important}} legislative responsibility that aldermen have is voting on the city budget each year," [...] Shiller said. She was the lone dissenting vote on Daley's 1996, 1997 and 1998 budgets. During hearings on Daley's 1996 budget, which included a $19.5 million property-tax increase, she submitted 123 questions on the budget in writing to department heads, but only 35 were answered. She objected to the <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> a period of several years of budget surpluses. She attended every hearing on Daley's 1997 budget armed with policy questions that she said went unanswered. She was often the only alderman present at budget hearings.|$|E
500|$|The {{widening}} {{project began}} construction on April 14, 1989, {{with the first}} project adding two lanes between San Marcos Boulevard and I-15. Additional funding was secured with a local sales <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 1987, providing $80million (about $ in [...] dollars), and an additional $7.8million (about $ in [...] dollars) from the California Transportation Commission. By March 1991, {{another part of the}} project from College Boulevard to Melrose Drive began the bidding process. The next year, the project began to wind down, with bidding on the final part of the work between Nordahl Road and I-15. The widening was complete by the beginning of 1994.|$|E
500|$|What is now I-370 was {{originally}} proposed {{as part of}} the Intercounty Connector in the late 1970s. The I-370 freeway opened on December 17, 1988, connecting I-270 to the Shady Grove Metro station. After {{three and a half years}} of construction, the freeway was four lanes wide and [...] long. Its construction cost $169 million, with federal funds paying for ninety percent of the cost. The state of Maryland's portion of the cost was funded with a portion of the proceeds of a nickel-per-gallon gas <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 1987. Prior to its opening, driving from I-270 to the Shady Grove Metro station involved exiting at Shady Grove Road and passing six traffic lights to arrive at the station. Upon its opening, the remainder of the Intercounty Connector was planned but not yet built. At the time, it was the third shortest interstate, after I-878 in New York and I-395 in Baltimore.|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the reforms}} of Isabella I which reduced noble power were {{reversed}} as a price for luring the nobility to the royalist side. [...] However, Charles understood that noble encroachment of power had helped cause the revolt, and embarked upon a new reform program. [...] Unpopular, corrupt, and ineffective officials were replaced; judicial functions of the Royal Council were limited; and local courts were revitalized. [...] Charles also adjusted {{the membership of the}} Royal Council; its hated president was replaced, the aristocracy's role reduced, and more gentry were added to it. [...] Realizing that the urban elite needed to have a stake in the royal government once more, Charles gave many of them positions, privileges, and government salaries. [...] The Cortes, while not as important as the comuneros had hoped, nevertheless maintained its power; it was still required to approve new taxes and could advise the king. [...] Charles also discouraged his officials from using overly coercive methods, after seeing his heavy-handed treatment of the Cortes of Corunna backfire. [...] If anything, the co-option of the middle class worked too well; when Charles' successor King Phillip II demanded a ruinously large <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the 1580s, the Cortes was too dependent on the Crown for money to effectively resist policies that would wreck the economy.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and earned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E

Abe's decision to delay the consumption <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> November 2014 and his push for a large fiscal deficit in the 2015 budget without social security cuts was interpreted as a victory for this faction within the LDP.
