5|$|Brønnøysund Airport {{installed}} the SCAT-I satellite-based landing system on 29 October 2007. Avinor's Steinar Hamar stated {{at the opening}} ceremony that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> have prevented both Flight 710 and Flight 744 at Namsos Airport in 1993. The roll-out, taking place at most of Avinor's regional airports, is scheduled for completion in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{was to be}} {{operable}} {{with the}} current battle command control and communications suite but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. It would provide exportable electrical power, and a battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the BCT Soldier subsystems. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be capable of integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{election}} there were concerns that a change to <b>the</b> electoral <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be required, as <b>the</b> pre-existing <b>system</b> <b>would</b> have favoured <b>the</b> National Democratic Party, the party of Mubarak loyalists. The National Democratic Party was dissolved in April, however.|$|R

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for Barbados, St. Vincent, and Saint Lucia on August15. The following day the watches were changed to warnings, since forecasters predicted that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> reach tropical storm status. Additional watches and warnings were also issued {{for the rest of}} Windward Islands.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because they believed that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|By August31, {{the storm}} began to slow and turn towards the west-northwest. The NHC {{noted that they}} did not have a firm grip on the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity. Below average sea surface {{temperatures}} ahead of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> hamper significant development. Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E

5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% {{of the time in}} order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tropical}} cyclone's short life, overall track errors in model guidance were not significant, and most models accurately indicated Jerry's westward to west-northwest course into the Caribbean Sea. Most models and official forecasts {{did not anticipate}} Jerry's dissipation, and numerous models indicated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> reach hurricane status within {{two to three days}} under favorable conditions. Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that indicated the depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT.|$|E
5|$|Early on September5, {{reconnaissance}} found {{a central}} barometric pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.38inHg), the lowest recorded {{in relation to}} the storm. Around this time, Babe also intensified into a hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 75mph (120km/h). Later that day, Hurricane Babe made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. By landfall, the eye of Babe had contracted to roughly 14mi (23km). On September6, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression and was moving northeast into Mississippi. The system continued this movement for the following two days. While crossing South Carolina, forecasters thought that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> emerge into the Atlantic Ocean and regenerate into a tropical depression. However, the remnants of Babe dissipated shortly before crossing into North Carolina early on September9.|$|E

5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered {{up for the}} first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans called for the system to open in 1966, with the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø Line and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway, and the new Furuset Line and Grorud Line. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third-rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways in Oslo. The first units in the T1000 series were two single-car prototypes designated T. They were test-run on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960, and were then put into service on the Kolsås Line. Prone to technical faults, they were taken out of regular service in 1982.|$|E

These <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> also randomly shut down due to high internal temperatures. Overheating in these Inspiron systems is mainly caused by performance-consuming tasks and software. This problem {{was determined to be}} due to the design of the air-flow from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> It <b>would</b> draw in dirt/dust and clog the heat sink, making air unable to pass through in order to cool <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> Affected models include the Dell Inspiron 1100, 1150, 5100, 5150, and 5160. Also affected is the Latitude 100L, a near-clone of these models.|$|R

Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out {{of a desire to}} keep them out of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston.

5|$|Late on November6, Ida re-emerged over water, {{entering}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Upon moving back over water, the storm quickly began to redevelop, with convection increasing around {{the center of}} circulation. Early on November7, Ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west of due north. Very warm sea surface temperatures ahead of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> have allowed for substantial intensification; however, wind shear over the area quickly increased, resulting in modest strengthening. Later that day, the storm turned northwestward {{in response to a}} strong trough over Mexico and a mid-level ridge extending from the Southeast United States to Hispaniola. As Ida neared the Yucatán Channel, an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane. By the morning of November8, the storm had attained Category2 status with winds of 100mph (155km/h).|$|E
5|$|Marked {{structural}} improvements {{took place}} on October17 and the NHC assessed a high probability of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48hours. That evening, corroborating data from ships, satellite imagery, and scatterometer estimates indicated {{the formation of a}} tropical depression by 12:00UTC. With the cyclone located over warm waters of 86°F (30°C) and within a very moist region with low wind shear, intensification was a certainty as the depression approached Mexico. Uncertainties existed as to how fast <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> move. Some forecast models depicting the system as stalling just offshore for several days, though forecasters indicated that a steady northward movement would lead to dissipation within 48hours.|$|E

5|$|Much {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the role of human error in the collision; once the engineer had forgotten (or missed) the approach signal there was no automatic system to prevent the collision. The NTSB noted that had a positive train control system been in place on the Metropolitan Subdivision the collision would have been less likely: <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> have detected MARC #286's unauthorized speed and stopped the train. The NTSB also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal Transit Administration for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part of capacity improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision. The NTSB argued that having this signal after Kensington would have reduced the likelihood of the sort of human error which caused the crash, and in the NTSB's view CSX and the FTA did not properly assess the effects of removing the signal.|$|E
5|$|Operation Igloo White was {{a covert}} United States joint {{military}} electronic warfare operation conducted from late January 1968 until February 1973, during the Vietnam War. These missions {{were carried out}} by the 553d Reconnaissance Wing, a U.S. Air Force unit flying modified EC-121R Warning Star aircraft, and VO-67, a specialized U.S. Navy unit flying highly modified OP-2E Neptune aircraft. This state-of-the-art operation utilized electronic sensors, computers, and communications relay aircraft in an attempt to automate intelligence collection. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> then assist in the direction of strike aircraft to their targets. The objective of those attacks was the logistical system of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) that snaked through southeastern Laos and was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese).|$|E
5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
