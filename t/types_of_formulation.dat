40|$|Purpose: To {{develop and}} {{characterize}} an oral extended-release matrix tablet of metformin hydrochloride {{using a combination}} of a hydrophobic carrier and a hydrophilic polymer, and two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulation</b> techniques. Methods: Various metformin hydrochloride formulations containing a hydrophobic carrier (stearic acid) and a hydrophilic polymer (polyethylene oxide) were prepared using a 32 factorial design. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulation</b> techniques – melt granulation and direct compression – were evaluated. The influence of the carrier, polymer and preparation method on metformin release from the formulations in vitro as well as other physicochemical properties were studied. The release data were subjected to various release kinetic models and also compared with those of a commercial brand. Results: The physicochemical characteristics of all the granules and tablets were generally satisfactory. Optimization results indicate that the release rate of metformin HCl was directly proportional to the levels of stearic acid (SA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) in the tablet formulations. Release rate was also dependent on the method of granulation used.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use pinhão derivatives, starch and coat extract, as new natural ingredients to develop cosmetic formulations. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulation,</b> gel and emulgel, and their controls were developed. The formulations were characterized by stability studies using thermal stress. The parameters analyzed were resistance to centrifugation, pH, spreadability, rheology, content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Sensory analysis was also performed to verify the acceptability of the ingredients to potential consumers. The pH was kept the same after heating/freezing cycles for all formulations, and the formulations showed stability by resistance to centrifugation. The formulations did not induce any skin irritation or cutaneous pH alteration. The pinhão starch addition improved spreadability stability and increased viscosity when compared with control formulations. The pinhão coat extract used in these formulations is a good source of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Moreover, sensory analysis indicates that the emulgel formulation is the best vehicle for adding pinhão starch and pinhão coat extract...|$|E

Currently, the most used ones can be fitted into two classes, namely vehicle flow formulations and set partitioning <b>formulations.</b> These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulations</b> differ from each other not only due to their variables and constraints but also due to their main features. Vehicle flow formulations {{have the advantage of}} being compact models, so general-purpose optimization packages can be used to straightforwardly solve them. However, they typically show weak linear relaxations and have a large number of constraints. Branch-and-cut methods based on specialized valid inequalities can also be devised to solve these formulations, but they have not shown to be effective for large-scale instances. On the other hand, set partitioning formulations have stronger linear relaxations, but requires the implementation of sophisticate techniques such as column generation and specialized branch-and-price methods.

Aims: To evaluate {{the release of}} dibucaine hydrochloride from semisolid vehicles of oil/aqueous type emulsion and aqueous gels, stabilized by using chitosan (CH) or chitosan acetate (CHAc). Methods: Emulsions were developed by varying the emulsifying agent: polysorbate 80, CH or CHAc and by combining CH with polysorbate 80 or CHAc with polysorbate 80. The hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose F 4 M was added as a stabilizing agent in gel formulations. The release rates of model drug from semisolid vehicles were measured by using a dialysis sac. Drug release was also quantified by using a validated UV-VIS spectrophotometric method. Results: The pH values showed minimal changes for emulsion and gel formulations. The drug is a cationic salt, {{and it is not}} able to bind polymer cations by electrostatic repulsion.

40|$|AbstractTransfenac, a lotion-like {{formulation}} of diclofenac, is described. It consists of pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients and mediates the agent transport through intact skin {{and into the}} target tissues. Therapeutically meaningful drug concentrations in the target tissue are reached even when the administered drug dose in Transfenac is below 0. 5 mg/kg body weight. Ultradeformable agent carriers, called Transfersomes, {{form the basis of}} Transfenac. These Transfersomes are proposed to cross the skin spontaneously under the influence of transepidermal water activity gradient (see [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1104 (1992) 226]). Diclofenac association with ultradeformable carriers permits it to have a longer effect and to reach 10 -times higher concentrations in the tissues under the skin in comparison with the drug from a commercial hydrogel. For example, Transfenac achieves intramuscular agent concentrations between 0. 5 and 2 μg/g and 2 and 20 μg/g at t= 12 h, depending on the tissue depth, when it is administered in the dose range 0. 25 – 2 mg/kg of rat body weight. A much higher drug concentration in a hydrogel (1. 25 – 10 mg/kg body weight) creates the drug level of only < 0. 5 μg/g in the muscle. The drug concentration in the rat patella for these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulation</b> is between 1 μg/g and 5 μg/g or 0. 4 μg/g, respectively. The relative advantage of diclofenac delivery by means of ultradeformable carriers increases with the treated muscle thickness and with decreasing drug dose, as seen in mice, rats and pigs; this can be explained by assuming that the drug associated with carriers is cleared less efficiently by the dermal capillary plexus. In pigs it suffices to use 0. 3 mg of diclofenac in highly deformable vesicles per kg body weight, spread over an area of 25 cm 2, to ensure therapeutic drug concentration in a 5 -cm thick muscle specimen, collected under the agent application site. When the drug is used in a hydrogel at 8 times higher dose, the average intramuscular concentration is at least three times lower and subtherapeutic. This suggests that diclofenac in Transfersomes has the potential to replace combined oral/topical diclofenac administration in humans...|$|E
40|$|Antisense oligonucleotides (AODNs) can {{selectively}} inhibit individual {{gene expression}} by binding specifically to rnRNA. The over-expression of the {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) has been observed in human breast and glioblastoma tumours and therefore AODNs designed to target the EGFR would be a logical approach to treat such tumours. However, poor pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and cellular uptake properties of AODNs have limited their potential to become successful therapeutic agents. Biodegradable polymeric poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (P(LA-GA)) and dendrimer delivery systems may allow us to overcome these problems. The use of combination therapy of AODNs and cytotoxic agents such as 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) in biodegradable polymeric formulations may further improve therapeutic efficacy. AODN and 5 -FU were either co-entrapped in a single microsphere formulation or individually entrapped in two separate microsphere formulations (double emulsion method) and release profiles determined in vitro. The release rates (biphasic) of the two agents were significantly slower when co-entrapped as a single microsphere formulation compared to those obtained with the separate formulations. Sustained release over 35 days was observed in both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulation.</b> Naked and microsphere-loaded AODN and 5 -FU (in separate formulations) were tested on an A 431 vulval carcinoma cell line. Combining naked or encapsulated drugs produced a greater reduction in viable cell number as compared with either agent alone. However, controls and Western blotting indicated that non-sequence specific cytotoxic effects {{were responsible for the}} differences in viable cell number. The uptake properties of an anionic dendrimer based on a pentaerythritol structure covalently linked to AODNs (targeting the EGFR) have been characterised. The cellular uptake of AODN linked to the dendrimer was up to 3. 5 -fold higher in A 431 cells as compared to naked AODN. Mechanistic studies suggested that receptor-mediated and adsorptive (binding protein-mediated) endocytosis were the predominant uptake mechanisms for the dendrimer-AODN. RNase H cleavage assay suggested that the dendrimer-AODN was able to bind and cleave the target site. A reduction of 20 %, 28 % and 45 % in EGFR expression was observed with 0. 05 μM, 0. 1 μM and 0. 5 μM dendrimer-AODN treatments respectively with a reduction in viable cell number. These results indicated that the dendrimer delivery system may reduce viable cell number by an antisense specific mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Recently, stimuli-responsive protein {{surfactants}} {{have been}} developed to control foams with applications in food, household, personal care products and industrial processes. Such protein surfactants can alter their interfacial properties in response to external stimuli such as pH and metal ions, offering a high level of foaming control. However, two main challenges have been hindering the widespread applications of such new generation of bio-surfactants, their high cost and the lack of fundamental knowledge that guides the design of formulation. To address these challenges, this research project aimed to: i) develop formulation for a designed stimuli-responsive protein surfactant DAMP 4 for foaming control with lowered overall cost; ii) deliver fundamental knowledge on interfacial physio-chemical properties of the mixture system of protein DAMP 4 and chemical surfactants/polymers; and iii) link the interfacial properties with the control of foaming. A multi-disciplinary approach has been deployed to study the protein surfactants at three different scales: i) at a macro-scale, the foam stability has been determined with foaming assay method while adsorption kinetic has been studied by dynamic surface tension measurements; ii) at a molecular level, dynamic change of interfacial structure of the mixture systems including film thickness and surface excess of individual components has been determined by X-ray and neutron reflectometry techniques, and iii) at a micro-scale, the dynamic three-dimensional microstructure of the foams has been revealed by the X-ray phase-contrast tomography technique. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulation</b> have been explored to improve the control of DAMP 4 -based foaming. The first type of formulation is based on the mixture of DAMP 4 and conventional chemical surfactants, and the second type concerns a mixing system of DAMP 4 and polysaccharide. Single DAMP 4 at low concentration (5 µM) did not give high stability of foams. However, with addition of small amount of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS, 18 - 54 µM, less than 1 % of its critical micelle concentration) to low concentration of DAMP 4 could significantly enhance the stability of foams. Importantly, foams of the DAMP 4 -SDS system can still be destabilized by Zn 2 + addition, retaining stimuli-response feature of the DAMP 4 systems. For the second type of formulation, two types of polysaccharides, which are surface active hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HMPC) and surface inactive pectin, have been used for the comparison of their control of DAMP 4 -based foams. At a polysaccharide concertation of 10 - 1 wt%, DAMP 4 -HPMC system showed higher foam stability whereas DAMP 4 -pectin system established defoaming ability. Combining fundamental knowledge at multi-scales (macro-, micro- and molecular levels), this research project has identified two key factors, the molecular interactions and subsequent adsorption kinetics, that affect the interfacial properties of the mixture systems and subsequently the foam stability. First, the molecular interactions in the mixture systems affect both adsorption kinetics and compositions of the adsorbed interfacial layer. The adsorption of protein DAMP 4 to the air-water interface requires an unfolding of its four-helix bundle in bulk solution to adapt a linear structure at the surface. Upon mixing with SDS, the DAMP 4 -SDS interactions could promote and stabilize the unfolding of this four-helix bundle, reducing the energy barrier required for DAMP 4 adsorption and thus enhancing adsorption kinetics of DAMP 4. Due to different surface-activity and charge nature of the polysaccharides used, HPMC and pectin have different interactions with DAMP 4. DAMP 4 -HPMC and DAMP 4 -pectin polysaccharide mixture systems adsorbed to the air-water interface in different manners. Competitive adsorption between DAMP 4 and HMPC was observed while co-adsorption of DAMP 4 and pectin occurred at the interface. Second, the adsorption kinetics {{plays a key role in}} determining the foam stability. Foaming systems with fast adsorption kinetics, which possess a smaller time constant (t 1 / 2), produce higher stability foams. The addition of small amount of SDS (18 µM) can decrease the adsorption time constant by a factor of 10, significantly enhancing the foam stability of DAMP 4 -SDS mixture system. On the other hand, additives such as Zn 2 + or polysaccharide pectin could prompt DAMP 4 to form aggregates or complexes that significantly slowed down the adsorption kinetics. As a result, destabilization of foams occurred. Third, molecular interactions affect not only the foam stability but also the three-dimensional microstructure of the foams. The foams in DAMP 4 -SDS mixture system adopted a polyhedral structure, which was similar to SDS foams, with a liquid volume fraction lower than that of single DAMP 4 but slightly higher than that of single SDS. In the DAMP 4 -HPMC mixed system, the resulted average bubble size of the DAMP 4 -HPMC mixture foam was similar to that of single DAMP 4 system but the liquid volume was higher than that of both single DAMP 4 and single HPMC foams. In summary, the PhD work has linked the molecular characteristics of DAMP 4, chemical surfactant and polysaccharide with their interfacial properties at macro-, micro- and molecular scales. The knowledge discovered could support future development of the next generation of protein surfactants and their formulations. Particularly, it offers opportunities to achieve higher level of foaming control (e. g., stimuli responsive feature) at lower cost through rational formulation design...|$|E

Here, we compared the immunogenic roles <b>of</b> these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>formulations</b> and also studied general immunomodulation by Shigella OMVs in adult BALB/c mice. The production of various pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 12, IL- 18, IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 4 and IL- 10) cytokine profile were assessed by in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro studies. MOMVs treated mice showed significantly enhanced cytokine production compared to SOMVs treated mice. MOMVs treatment has also upregulated iNOS mRNA synthesis in macrophages. Overall the OMVs of Shigella were found to show a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 response and maintain the balance between pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation in mice. This will be crucial {{in the development of}} the next generation OMVs based vaccine against shigellosis...|$|R
