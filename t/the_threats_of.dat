40|$|The study {{centers on}} the power of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) as {{predictors}} of prejudice against stereotypical and nonstereotypical homosexuals under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty. Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) is an individual difference variable that measures the tendency for individuals to unquestionably follow those perceived to be authorities. Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) is an individual difference variable that measures the degree to which an individual prefers inequality among social groups. The RWA and SDO Scales are considered to be two of the strongest predictors of prejudice, such as prejudice against homosexuals. The study focuses on the unique predictive power of these two variables in predicting prejudice against homosexuals. The study also examines <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> situational <b>threat</b> in prejudice, specifically <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death (mortality salience) and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty (uncertainty salience). Competing predictions from theories involving <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death (Terror Management Theory) and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty (Uncertainty Management Theory) are also tested. The preference for expected information in the form of stereotypes concerning male homosexuals (that is, a stereotypical or non-stereotypical homosexual) were tested. The difference between the predictive power ofRWA and SDO was examined by measuring how these variables predict liking of a stereotypical or non-stereotypical homosexual under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, or a control condition. Along with completing a measure for RWA and a measure for SDO, participants were asked to think of their own death, of their being uncertain or about watching television then were asked to read about a week in the life of either a stereotypical or non-stereotypical male homosexual. Participants were then asked to evaluate the individual and his essay. Based on the participants' evaluations, results from 180 heterosexual university students show that RWA and SDO are strong predictors for disliking of a stereotypical homosexual under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and disliking of a non-stereotypical homosexual under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death. Furthermore, however, results show that RWA is a particularly strong predictor of disliking of a stereotypical homosexual under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, whereas SDO is an exceptionally strong predictor of disliking of the non-stereotypical homosexual under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death. This further adds to the notion that RWA and SDO are indeed unique predictors of prejudice. Implications are also explored, including the fact that the study simuhaneously examined the role of individual difference variables and situational threat variables, as well as exploratory analysis on Dominating Authoritarians...|$|R
25|$|The {{publications}} {{among other}} issues also analyzed the German response to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> guerrilla warfare.

5|$|The film brings {{together}} the video diaries recorded by four friends and {{students at the}} Tariq bin Ziad High School for Boys in Zayouna, a mixed-race, middle-class area in the Karrada suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. Entering their final year in 2006, each has high expectations for the year ahead and hope to graduate so {{they can have a}} chance to attend university. At the same time, the boys must also deal with the increasing sectarian violence that is starting to extend into Karrada. They face <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> roadside bombings, the hassles of security checkpoints on their way to school, frequent curfews, the constant presence of American Apache helicopters overhead, and the deterioration of their neighbourhood which becomes rife with assassinations, muggings and kidnappings. Many of their fellow students, unmotivated and academically underperforming, are absent from school.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Auxois is very low, {{and it is}} one of the rarest of the nine French draft horse breeds. In 2001, it had the eighth-smallest {{population of}} the nine breeds, making <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> inbreeding and extinction very real. In 2006, 250 active breeding mares and 32 stallions were reported, with 125 breeders (the term breeder applying to any person owning at least one active breeding mare). The Auxois represented 1 percent of total French draft horse registrations in 2007. Burgundy is by far the main breeding area, with a few horses in the Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions. There are no known registered Auxois living outside France and it is almost unknown outside of its home region, even within the rest of France. Of the nine French draft horse breeds, the Auxois is the only one that is not exported. Between 1992 and 2011, between 80 and 146 foals were born each year, with numbers ranging from 105 to 128 between 2007 and 2011.|$|E

40|$|Changes at {{work are}} often {{accompanied}} with <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of,</b> or actual, resource loss. Through an experiment, we investigated the detrimental effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss on adaptive task performance. Self-regulation (i. e., task focus and emotion control) was hypothesized to buffer the {{negative relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss and adaptive task performance. Adaptation was conceptualized as relearning after a change in task execution rules. <b>Threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss was manipulated for 100 participants undertaking an air traffic control task. Using discontinuous growth curve modeling, 2 kinds of adaptation—transition adaptation and reacquisition adaptation—were differentiated. The results showed that individuals who experienced <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss had a stronger drop in performance (less transition adaptation) and a subsequent slower recovery (less reacquisition adaptation) compared with the control group who experienced no threat. Emotion control (but not task focus) moderated the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss and transition adaptation. In this respect, individuals who felt threatened but regulated their emotions performed better immediately after the task change (but not later on) compared with those individuals who felt threatened and did not regulate their emotions as well. However, later on, relearning (reacquisition adaptation) under <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss was facilitated when individuals concentrated on the task at hand...|$|R
