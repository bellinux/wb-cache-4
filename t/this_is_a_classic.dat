25|$|Built in 1911, the Guelph Central Station (still in use), was {{constructed}} by the Grand Trunk Railway which had arrived in Guelph in 1856; years later, it {{was taken over by}} the Canadian National Railway. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of early 20th Century Canadian railway station design and has been designated as a heritage structure per the Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act. The Romanesque Revival building, with its Italianate tower, has been listed on the Canadian Register since 2006 and was formally recognized as one of Canada's Historic Places in November 1992. A renovation project in 2016-2017 provided various benefits, including repairs to maintain and restore heritage aspects.|$|E
25|$|A second, longer eastern ridge {{runs out}} {{to the north of}} Bowscale Fell, forming the {{northern}} wall of Bullfell Beck. This has two subsidiary tops at 2,017ft and 1,981ft and ends steeply at Raven Crag above the Mungrisdale to Heskett Newmarket road. Perched in a bowl scooped out on the northern face of this ridge is Bowscale Tarn. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> corrie tarn, held in by a whalebacked moraine and having a depth of around 60ft. Bowscale Tarn was a popular tourist attraction in Victorian times, visitors being brought by pony to observe its wild and moody setting. Tastes change and the tarn now finds itself on few itineraries for a grand tour of the District. Legend had it that the tarn was home to two immortal fish, one version of the tale also crediting them with the gift of speech. Above the water is Tarn Crag, the steepest face on the fell.|$|E

25|$|From outside, {{the temple}} {{actually}} looks like a ekakuta (single tower and shrine) temple because the two lateral shrines are simple extensions of {{the wall of the}} mantapa. Their towers are a later addition. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of a trikuta (three shrines and towers) that looks like a ekakuta. A large open hall with tall pillars was added during later times making the original porch and closed mantapa look like the inner portion of the temple. The central shrine has five projections per side and the tower is complete though without the kalasha (decorative structure on top). Since the shrine is square in plan, the topping roof (a helmet like sculptured stone) follows the same plan. There are three tiers of decorative smaller roofs bearing their own kalasa that form the body of the main tower. The superstructure on top of the vestibule (forming the nose) has only two tiers of decorative roofs. This is why the sukanasi looks like an extension of the main tower. The two lateral shrines also have five projections per side. The top of these shrines and the wall of the mantapa are crowned with a row of decorated roofs just like the main shrine.|$|E
500|$|A second key {{criticism}} of the Act is that it lacked support from the business community, and thus was doomed to failure. Business support for national planning and government intervention was very strong in 1933, but had collapsed by mid-1934. Many studies conclude, however, that business support for NIRA was never uniform. Larger, older businesses embraced the legislation while smaller, newer ones (more nimble in a highly competitive market and with less capital investment to lose if they failed) did not. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> problem of cartels, and thus NIRA codes failed as small business abandoned the cartels. Studies of the steel, automobile manufacturing, lumber, textile, and rubber industries and the level and source {{of support for the}} NIRA tend to support this conclusion. Without the support of [...] industry, the Act could never have performed as it was intended.|$|E

2500|$|The next moña layers {{are from}} the descarga [...] "Guatacando" [...] by the Fania All-Stars (1968). [...] The trumpet figure is one clave in length, while the {{trombone}} figure is two claves. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of how moñas are layered. The trombone Moña consists of two parts, a call-and-response structure. The trumpet moña begins on the last note of {{first half of the}} trombone moña. The second half of the trombone moña begins on the pulse (subdivision) immediately following the last note of the trumpet moña.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Takeshi Yamakawa {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} fuzzy control, {{through a set of}} simple dedicated fuzzy logic chips, in an [...] "inverted pendulum" [...] experiment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> control problem, in which a vehicle tries to keep a pole mounted on its top by a hinge upright by moving back and forth. Yamakawa subsequently made the demonstration more sophisticated by mounting a wine glass containing water and even a live mouse {{to the top of the}} pendulum: the system maintained stability in both cases. Yamakawa eventually went on to organize his own fuzzy-systems research lab to help exploit his patents in the field.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{institutions}} have undertaken zero-tolerance policies, for example, in the military, in the workplace, and in schools, {{in an effort}} to eliminate various kinds of illegal behavior, such as harassment. Proponents hope that such policies will underscore the commitment of administrators to prevent such behavior. Others raise a concern about this use of zero-tolerance policies, a concern which derives from analysis of errors of omission versus errors of commission. Here is the reasoning: Failure to proscribe unacceptable behavior may lead to errors of omission—too little will be done. But zero tolerance may be seen as a kind of ruthless management, which may lead to a perception of [...] "too much being done". If people fear that their co-workers or fellow students may be fired, terminated, or expelled, they may not come forward at all when they see behavior deemed unacceptable. (<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> example of Type I and type II errors.) The Type Two error, where it occurs with respect to zero tolerance, leads to the situation where too stringent a policy may actually reduce reports of illegal behavior.|$|E
50|$|King Béla IV of Hungary had summoned {{a council}} of war at Esztergom, {{a large and}} {{important}} settlement upriver from Buda and Pest. <b>As</b> Batu <b>was</b> advancing on Hungary from the northeast, the Hungarian leadership decided to concentrate their strength at Pest and then head north to confront the Mongol army. When news of the Hungarian battle strategy reached the Mongol commanders, they slowly withdrew to the Sajo River, drawing their enemies on. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> Mongol strategy, ultimately perfected by Subutai. He prepared a battlefield suitable to his tactics, and waited for his enemies to blunder in. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strong position, because woods prevented their ranks from being clearly scouted or seen, while across the river on the plain of Mohi, the Hungarian army was widely exposed.|$|R
25|$|The codename for {{the main}} {{operations}} to take Lae was Operation Postern. Planned as part of wider operations to eventually secure the Huon Peninsula, the operation to capture Lae was planned by General Thomas Blamey, who assumed command of the Allied New Guinea Force, and Australian I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> pincer movement, involving an amphibious assault east of the town, and an airborne landing near Nadzab, 50 kilometres (30mi) to the west. Battle casualties for the 9th Division during Operation Postern amounted to 547, of which 115 were killed and 73 were posted as missing, and 397 were wounded, while the 7th Division suffered 142 casualties, of which 38 were killed. The Japanese lost about 1,500 killed, while <b>a</b> further 2,000 <b>were</b> captured.|$|R

2500|$|Profile: [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> done by many performers. The {{assistant}} stands side-on to {{the board}} and then bends backwards. The impalement artist then aims a series of knives, axes or arrows {{along the line of}} the front edge of the assistant, beginning around the legs and ending with the last throw or shot coming close to the assistant's throat. One aspect of this pose is that it accentuates the vulnerability of the assistant, particularly with the last impact tantalisingly close to the throat. Another important aspect for knifethrowers is that {{the upper part of the}} assistant's body is positioned so that a series of throws can be landed above it - a flexible target girl might be able to place her neck and the upper part of her chest in a horizontal line. A skilled thrower can use the way that a knife turns in flight to land it sloping at a downward angle from the board; thus, the point of the knife can impact safely above the assistant but the rest of the knife can slope down and come very close indeed to the assistant's body, even making contact on some occasions.|$|E

25|$|Tutsis {{naturally}} welcomed this ethnic schism because {{thinking in}} these racialized terms had tangible social benefits – it vindicated their minority domination over the majority Hutus. This administrative propaganda had a subconscious effect of convincing Hutus and Tutsis {{that they were}} in fact members of separate ethnic, not social groups. For Belgian colonial elites, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> “divide and conquer” strategy: cleaving groups along salient social boundaries served as a mechanism in securing colonial control over indigenous groups. Initially, Belgian administrators used an expedient method of classification {{based on the number of}} cattle a person owned – anyone with ten or more cattle <b>was</b> considered <b>a</b> member of the aristocratic Tutsi class. However, the presence of wealthy Hutu was problematic. Then in 1933, the colonial administration institutionalized a more rigid ethnic classification by issuing ethnic identification cards; every Rwandan <b>was</b> officially branded <b>a</b> Tutsi, Hutu, or Twa.|$|R
