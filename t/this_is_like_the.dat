2500|$|After 22 to 28 days in {{the nest}} (depending on the owners preference) the young birds are removed {{and placed in a}} section of a large loft or in a smaller loft built for the purpose. After a few days of {{learning}} how to locate the water and eating by themselves they are allowed to wander out of the loft and peck around in the garden, while doing this they are constantly observing their surroundings and becoming familiar with them. At about age six to seven weeks the birds will begin taking off, flying in very small circles around their loft and owners house. As their confidence grows they gradually wander farther and farther from home until they are out of sight and can remain so for as much as two hours before returning. When a few trainers fly their pigeons in the same area, these flying [...] "batches" [...] (as flocks of pigeons are called) can number in the thousands. It does not, however, help them much in relation to finding their home from long distances away, a fundamental of pigeon racing. As confident flyers, the young pigeons are taken on progressively longer 'training tosses', driven a distance away from their home and released. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> format of a real race, however on a much smaller scale and it is usually not timed {{in the same way as}} a race. This practice of loft flying and tossing continues throughout a pigeon's career.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1989 posthumous book, The Global Village, McLuhan, {{collaborating with}} Bruce R. Powers, {{provided}} a strong {{conceptual framework for}} understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated {{with the rise of}} a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. [...] "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere." [...] The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic {{with the advent of the}} global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The [...] "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow" [...] inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.|$|E

60|$|Of {{important}} intelligence nothing occurs {{save the}} termination of all suspense {{on the subject of}} poor James Macdonald Buchanan. He died at Malta. The celebrated Dugald Stewart is also dead, famous for his intimate acquaintance with the history and philosophy of the human mind. There is much of water-painting in all metaphysics, which consist rather of words than ideas. But Stewart was most impressive and eloquent. In former days I was frequently with him, but not for many years. Latterly, I am told, he had lost not the power of thinking, but the power of expressing his thoughts by speech. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Metamorphosis of Ovid, the bark binding in and hardening the living flesh.|$|E

60|$|The second-sight is {{likewise}} in the Isle of Man, as appears by this instance: Captain Leathes, the chief commander of Belfast, in his voyage 1690, lost thirteen men by a violent storm; and upon his {{landing in the}} Isle of Man, an ancient man, clerk to a parish there, told him immediately {{that he had lost}} thirteen men there; the captain inquired how he came to the knowledge of that; he answered that it was by thirteen lights, which he had seen come into the churchyard; as Mr. Sacheverel tells us in his late description of the Isle of Man.

60|$|And {{since in}} any bulk of matter our {{thoughts}} can never {{arrive at the}} utmost divisibility, therefore there is an apparent infinity to us also in that, which has the infinity also of number; but with this difference,--that, in the former considerations of the infinity of space and duration, we only use addition of numbers; whereas <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> division of an unit into its fractions, wherein the mind also can proceed in infinitum, {{as well as in}} the former additions; it being indeed but the addition still of new numbers: though in the addition of the one, we can have no more the POSITIVE idea of a space infinitely great, than, in the division of the other, we can have the positive idea of a body infinitely little;--our idea of infinity being, as I may say, a growing or fugitive idea, still in a boundless progression, that can stop nowhere.|$|E

But the blessedness that we shall enjoy in heaven, in the very substance of it, consisteth not wholly, nor principally, in a resemblance of, but in {{the enjoyment}} of God himself; 'Heirs of God.' Wherefore there shall not be in us a likeness only to, but the very nature of God: 'Heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ' (Rom 8:17). Hence the apostle tells us, that he 'rejoiced in hope of the glory of God' (Rom 5:2). Not only in hope of a resemblance of it. 'The Lord is my portion, saith my soul.'

60|$|I do {{not know}} of any poetry to quote which {{adequately}} expresses this yearning for the Wild. Approached from this side, the best poetry is tame. I {{do not know}} where to find in any literature, ancient or modern, any account which contents me of that Nature with which even I am acquainted. You will perceive that I demand something which no Augustan nor Elizabethan age, which no culture, in short, can give. Mythology comes nearer to it than anything. How much more fertile a Nature, at least, has Grecian mythology its root in than English literature! Mythology is the crop which the Old World bore before its soil was exhausted, before the fancy and imagination were affected with blight; and which it still bears, wherever its pristine vigor is unabated. All other literatures endure only as the elms which overshadow our houses; but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> great dragon-tree of the Western Isles, as old as mankind, and, whether that does or not, will endure as long; for the decay of other literatures makes the soil in which it thrives.|$|E
60|$|The inferences {{were drawn}} (by myself and others) that Elizabeth had told de Quadra, on September 3, 'the third of THIS month' (as Mr. Froude, by {{a slip of}} the pen, {{translates}} 'a tres del passado'), that she would marry the Arch Duke; that Cecil spoke to de Quadra on the same day, and that 'the day after this conversation' (September 4) the Queen told de Quadra that Amy 'was dead or nearly so.' The presumption {{would be that the}} Queen spoke of Amy's death FOUR DAYS BEFORE IT OCCURRED, and a very awkward position, in that case, would be the Queen's. Guilty foreknowledge would be attributed to her. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> real situation if Dr. Ernst Bekker is right.* Dr. Bekker, knowing from the portion of de Quadra's letter omitted by Mr. Froude, that he reached the Court at Windsor on September 6, 1560, supposes that he had interviews with Elizabeth and Cecil on that day, and that Elizabeth, prematurely, announced to him Amy's death, next day, on September 7. But Mr. Gairdner has proved that this scheme of dates is highly improbable.|$|E
60|$|Doubt not, O poet, but persist. Say 'It is in me, {{and shall}} out.' Stand there, balked and dumb, {{stuttering}} and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand and strive, {{until at last}} rage draw out of thee that dream-power which every night shows thee is thine own; a power transcending all limit and privacy, and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity. Nothing walks, or creeps, or grows, or exists, which must not in turn arise and walk before him as exponent of his meaning. Comes he to that power, his genius is no longer exhaustible. All the creatures by pairs and by tribes pour into his mind as into a Noah's ark, to come forth again to people a new world. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> stock of air for our respiration or for the combustion of our fireplace; not a measure of gallons, but the entire atmosphere if wanted.
