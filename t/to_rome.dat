5|$|Germanicus' {{successes in}} Germany {{had made him}} popular with the soldiers.

Tiberius took notice, and had Germanicus recalled <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> and informed {{him that he would}} be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command.|$|E

5|$|On the {{question}} of Malcolm's putative pilgrimage, pilgrimages <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> or other long-distance journeys, were far from unusual. Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Cnut and Mac Bethad have already been mentioned. Rognvald Kali Kolsson {{is known to have}} gone crusading in the Mediterranean in the 12th century. Nearer in time, Dyfnwal of Strathclyde died on pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> in 975 as did Máel Ruanaid uá Máele Doraid, King of the Cenél Conaill, in 1025.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais {{was brought}} before the king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, before which the king seized his lands. At the trial, St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then asked for an appeal <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> his fief, or lands, was forfeit. Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to appeal <b>to</b> <b>Rome.</b>|$|E

The archbishop went <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> along with Bishop Cyneberht of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope. After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield back down to a bishopric. Besides these papal actions, {{there are indications that}} the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognised the elevation of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Crínán, Macbeth was evidently unchallenged. Marianus Scotus tells how the king made a pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> in 1050, where, Marianus says, he gave money to the poor {{as if it were}} seed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70, who headed an interim government with Domitian as the representative of the Flavian family in the Senate. Upon receiving the tidings of his rival's defeat and death at Alexandria, the new Emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> along with an edict or a declaration of policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero, especially those relating to treason. In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt however, continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing. By the end 70, he finally returned <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> and was properly installed as Emperor.|$|E
50|$|A fourth law, the Lex Clodia Frumentaria {{required}} {{the distribution of}} grain <b>to</b> <b>Rome's</b> poor citizens for free. Before this law, grain had been distributed <b>to</b> <b>Rome's</b> poor at a low price instead. This was somewhat radical, as during the first centuries of the republic, as per the Valerian and Porcian laws, several citizens had been executed for distributing free grain to the poor, under the concern that they were plotting to win popular support in order {{to overthrow the government}} and seize a tyranny.|$|R

50|$|During {{the next}} two years he {{remained}} in Rome, shoring up political support for Gaius, while Gaius campaigned in Spain, Epirus and Greece. After the Battle of Pharsalus, Gaius was appointed Dictator, and he proceeded to transfer some of his veteran legions to Italy. However, the legions became mutinous, forcing Mark Antony, the Master of the Horse, <b>to</b> leave <b>Rome</b> <b>to</b> deal with them (47 BC). In an unprecedented procedure, Antonius appointed Lucius as Praefectus urbi, with orders <b>to</b> keep <b>Rome</b> secure while Antonius was absent. Unfortunately, Lucius proved unable <b>to</b> prevent <b>Rome</b> from falling into turmoil.|$|R
25|$|In August 2006 {{extracts}} from the 60-year-old {{diary of a}} nun of the Convent of Santi Quattro Coronati {{were published in the}} Italian press, claiming that Pius XII had issued such an order <b>to</b> <b>Rome's</b> convents and monasteries.|$|R

5|$|He {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> and was consul for {{a second}} time in 7BC, and in 6BC was granted tribunician power (tribunicia potestas) and control in the East, all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held.

5|$|In 1064, Echmarcach {{seems to}} have {{accompanied}} by Donnchad upon a pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>Rome.</b> By this time the two {{may well have been}} of an advanced age, and both appear to have died in the city soon afterwards. Surviving sources give conflicting dates for Echmarcach's passing, and it is uncertain whether he died in 1064 or 1065. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of Loch Cé, and the Annals of Ulster indicate that he died in 1064. The eleventh-century Chronicon of Marianus Scotus (died 1082) records that Echmarcach died in 1065, in a statement which implies that Echmarcach and Donnchad travelled <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> together. Donnchad himself {{seems to have}} died in 1064, as a multitude of sources report his pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> and demise that year. Several of these sources appear to indicate that Donnchad died at Santo Stefano Rotondo, an ancient basilica on the Caelian Hill. This building was an important place of pilgrimage to contemporaries, and apparently housed both Echmarcach and Donnchad before they died. Pilgrimages such as those of Echmarcach and Donnchad were not unheard of amongst high-ranking Gaelic and Norse-Gaelic contemporaries, and several such high-status figures are known to have perished undertaking pilgrimages of their own <b>to</b> <b>Rome.</b> If Echmarcach's father was indeed Ragnall mac Gofraid, and if Echmarcach had been born only a few years before his father's death, Echmarcach would have thus been about sixty-five when he himself was laid to rest.|$|E
5|$|In 1143, Nigel became {{involved}} in a quarrel with the powerful Henry of Blois. Charges of depriving a priest of a church, giving church property to laymen, and encouraging sedition were brought against Nigel, and {{he was forced to}} go <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> to defend himself, only reaching Rome in 1144. He did not return to his diocese until 1145. He probably accompanied Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who went <b>to</b> <b>Rome</b> around this time on separate business. While he was in Rome, Pope Lucius II issued a number of rulings in Nigel's favor, ordering his restitution to Ely. He was then finally reconciled with Stephen by paying a fine of £200 and offering his son Richard fitzNeal as a hostage. While Nigel was at Rome, Ely was attacked by the king's forces. The monks sent to Geoffrey de Mandeville for aid, and Geoffrey came and occupied the Isle of Ely, while the king's forces occupied the lands of the diocese outside the Isle. Both occupying forces did damage to the lands of the diocese and the cathedral chapter. The monks, in the Liber Eliensis, complained that Nigel had taken items from the church to finance his trip <b>to</b> <b>Rome,</b> and that they were required to help contribute to the bribe when Nigel was reconciled with Stephen.|$|E
