40|$|In recent years, the Swedish {{railway track}} {{system has been}} {{neglected}} in terms of capacity and maintenance. To adapt the existing system to current traffic load {{there is a great}} need for extensive improvement and maintenance. Shortcomings are especially occurring on older embankments running over soft subgrades. To select the most suitable method for reinforcement of the embankment, it is important to evaluate different solutions from a life cycle cost perspective. In long-term perspective, it is often shown that a method with low investment cost causes a higher maintenance cost and a shorter technical lifetime. Today, most of the decisions regarding reinforcement and maintenance are based on existing experience and budgetary constraints. This can often limit the ability to think long term and make sustainable cost efficiencies. Currently the most common reinforcement method is ballast cleaning with frost insulation. A method that should be seen as relatively short-term and in most cases does not increase the capacity to a desired level. An alternative to this method is to reinforce the embankment with geogrid and shift the ballast in the <b>top</b> <b>ballast</b> layers. The method is practical more comprehensive but from a theoretical perspective it is more beneficial. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to investigate whether reinforcement of track bed using geogrids and shift ballast in the overlaying ballast layer is more beneficial from a life-cycle cost perspective, than ballast cleaning and new frost insulation. This study is based on a simplified life cycle cost analysis that includes investment costs, maintenance costs and energy costs. System boundaries and model specifications will be based on a literature review, reference projects and interviews with suppliers of used products and technical solutions. The established model should be seen as a simplification of reality but seeks to illustrate a realistic case where an older railway embankment over soft subgrade is in need of reinforcement. The life-cycle cost analysis showed that reinforce the track bed with geogrid and shifting ballast in the overlaying ballast layer was the most favorable option from both a cost and environmental standpoint. This is mainly due to the long lifetime and extended maintenance intervals. In the model, there is some uncertainty and it seems to be that an area that is in need of more research. If resources are spent on expanding the use of life-cycle cost analysis in the transport sector there can be economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development...|$|E

The time-history curve of T 4 (Fig.  8 a) shows that the strain was mainly a compressive strain. However, the maximum transversal tensile strain was about 61.222 με, which was almost twice than the corresponding values of other three structures. This reveals that the trackbed with asphalt layer at the <b>top</b> of <b>ballast</b> trackbed mainly experiences transversal tensile stress while being compressed in longitudinal direction, {{which is similar to}} being in the state of simple tensile stress and is adverse to the long-term performance of asphalt layer.|$|R
50|$|Submerging is done {{by opening}} the vents in the <b>top</b> of the <b>ballast</b> tanks, as well as opening the valves in the bottom. This allows water to flood into the tank, and allows the air already present inside the tank to escape through the top vents. as the air escapes from the tank, the vessel's {{buoyancy}} decreases, thus causing it to sink. In order for the submarine to surface, the vents in the <b>top</b> of the <b>ballast</b> tanks are shut, and compressed air is allowed into the tanks. The high-pressure air pocket pushes the water out through the bottom valves and increases the vessel's buoyancy, causing it to rise. A submarine may have several types of ballast tank: the main ballast tanks, which are the main tanks used for diving and surfacing, and trimming tanks, which are used to adjust the submarine's attitude (its 'trim') both {{on the surface and}} when underwater.|$|R

50|$|On vintage submarines, Kingston valves are fitted at {{the bottom}} of certain ballast tanks, such as safety, negative, and bow {{buoyancy}} tanks.

During peacetime the Kingston valves are closed when the submarine is on the surface, the valves and vents being opened to dive, but to reduce the time required for diving in wartime the Kingston valves are left permanently open when at sea, the water being kept out of the ballast tanks by the air pressure of the trapped air. This pressure is released when the vents are opened for diving, allowing the water to enter through the open Kingston valves.|$|R
40|$|Repeated train loads produce {{settlements}} in railway tracks, particularly in ballasted trail tracks. When the settlement reaches the allowable limit, a maintenance method {{should be applied}} to bring the railway tracks into the original position. Settlements in railway tracks are hugely influenced by degree of ballast fouling (i. e., a ballast fouling index) in addition to train loads themselves (i. e., from large number of train passes). Sources of ballast fouling vary from ballast layer itself to underneath layers. Fouling materials coming from underneath layers {{is also an important}} source of ballast fouling in addition to particle crushing. Tamping method, stoneblowing and cleaning/replacement are the maintenance methods in practice currently. While replacement method is rarely applied due to huge costs and interruption to regular traffic, tamping method is applied throughout the world. However, tamping application induces particle crushing due to tamping tools in addition to loosening of <b>top</b> <b>ballasts</b> (i. e., thereby reducing original compaction level). Effect of tamping method on settlement characteristics haven’t been studied before. In this research, effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics of fouled ballast were studied conducting scaleddown model tests. Fouled ballast was simulated by gap-graded gradation curves with gravel (i. e., 1 / 5 size of actual ballast) and medium sand (D 50 = 1. 54 mm). In model tests, 100 loading cycles (no. of loading cycles were limited to 100 as this is a manual-controlled process) were applied to simulate cyclic behaviour with the designed vertical stress. After 100 loading cycles were applied, tamping method was simulated as in field conditions using a simple tool. After tamping application, again 100 loading cycles were applied with the same vertical stress. Continuous images were captured during each loading cycle to obtain strain distribution in ballast layer. The results revealed that settlement characteristics are influenced by degree of ballast fouling in addition to tamping application. As anticipated, the results suggested that settlement reduce after tamping application, mainly due to densification of specimen from previous 100 loading cycles. The results further revealed that the largest reduction in settlement occurs at 30 - 50 % of fouling index (FIP,m). Relationship of settlement ? no. of loading cycles was fitted as two processes; initial and residual settlement processes. The results suggested that initial settlement rate (?) becomes smaller after tamping application beyond 15 % of FIP,m. The results also suggested that residual settlement rate increases after taming application beyond 30 % of FIP,m. If results are interpreted in terms of practical application, {{it can be said that}} tamping application is effective only up to 30 % of FIP,m (which is equal to percentage of fouling materials for gadgraded sand-gravel specimens tested in this research). More detailed analysis on effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics were studied using strain distribution evaluated using the images captured during loading cycles in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) software (i. e., Flow-PIV). The PIV results confirmed that tamping application loosens <b>top</b> <b>ballasts,</b> particularly, at the sides of sleeper, where tamping tools are inserted. In next step, void ratio characteristics of sand-gravel specimens (simulating fouled ballasts) were evaluated in YADE (a DEM approach). In YADE, a method was proposed to produce gap-graded gradation curves. Verification of YADE simulations were done by the results of laboratory density tests. The comparison of results showed differences in void ratios (i. e., maximum and minimum void ratios). As laboratory materials consist of irregular particles and DEM simulations were conducted with spheres, the difference in void ratios is assumed to be due to different shapes of particles. Therefore, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced using the results of image analysis (i. e., in ImageJ) on shape characteristics of medium sand and gravel particles. Introduction of clump particles led to have similar results as those of laboratory void ratio characteristics. The results further revealed that variation of void ratios with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics with some accuracy. In next analysis, strength and deformation characteristics of fouled ballast were studied from triaxial compression tests. Triaxial compression tests were conducted in two series; dense and loose specimens simulated by 80 and 50 % of relative density, Dr respectively. The results from laboratory tests suggested that strength properties, represented by peak deviator stress, qf, and failure friction angle, ??f, change with FIP,m with some similarities with variation of ??with FIP,m. In next part, triaxial compression tests were conducted in DEM simulations with spheres. However, as comparison of DEM results with those of laboratory tests is influenced by particle shape, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced in DEM simulations. The results suggested that clump shape can simulate stressstrain behaviours same as laboratory triaxial compression tests. As different gradation curves can be simulated in YADE simulations, the method used can be extended to different type of fouled ballasts through different gradation curves. Also, it is also clear that variation of qf and ?f with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics (particularly, variation of ??) of fouled ballasts with FIP,m with some accuracy. In a simultaneous work, an in-situ method was proposed to evaluate particle size distribution of fouled ballast using image analysis techniques. ImageJ software was used to conduct image analysis. Particles (i. e., both gravel and medium sand) were simulated by different shapes in ImageJ and found the best available shape as ellipse shape to simulate laboratory particles. Gradation curves were evaluated as area-, number of particle- and volume-based gradation curves. Area-based gradation curve was possible to produce the gradation curve evaluated by sieve analysis test with some image analysis techniques. However, number of particles-based gradation curve underestimates that of sieve analysis. However, given both area- and number of particle-based gradation curves are not based on volume of particles (which is the case with sieve analysis test), a method was proposed to evaluate thickness of particles using 2 D images (hence, evaluation of volume of particle is possible). It was also discussed how definition of grain size should be used in image analysis results to compare with those of sieve analysis test. Finally, a simple method was proposed to evaluate volume-based gradation curve of fouled ballast using 2 D images using a size correction factor on grain size...|$|R

The school principal requested the study after expressing concern that the compound, which had leaked from several fluorescent lamp ballast casings, might contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). On December 7, 1981, a wipe sample was collected and analyzed. The surface of a luminaire where the ballast had previously burned out contained 3600 micrograms of PCB which was reported as Aroclor- 1242 (53469219). Other samples contained 0. 9 and 0. 6 micrograms of PCB per 100 square centimeters. The ballasts may have inadequate internal thermal protective mechanisms to prevent overheating and ultimate burnout, {{both of which are}} causes of leakage of the thermal dielectric compound. The author concludes that significant quantities of PCBs were released during ballast burnout. The author suggests that thermally unprotected ballasts be replaced with thermally protected units of Class-P classification. On December 4, 1981, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was requested to determine if the thermal-dielectric compound that had leaked from several fluorescent lamp ballast casings contained polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). On December 7, 1 b 1. bulk solid and wipe samples were obtained to determine the presence of PCBs. A sample of the thermal-dielectric compound obtained from the surface of a luminaire in the cafeteria (where a ballast had previously burned-out) contained 3600 micrograms of PCB (reported as Aroclor 1 4). Samples obtained from the <b>top</b> surfaces of <b>ballasts</b> from the Art Room and Principal 27 s Office contained 0. 9 and 0. 6 micrograms of PCB per 100 square centimeters (reported as Aroclor 1260), respectively. These results indicate that the ballasts tested may have inadequate internal thermal protective mechanisms to prevent overheating and ultimate burnout, both of which are causes of leakage of the thermal-dielectric compound from the fluorescent lamp ballasts. Based upon the health effects associated with exposure to PCBs and studies demonstrating that significant quantities of PCBs are released during ballast burnout, NIOSH recommends replacement of thermally unprotected ballasts with thermally protected units of Class P classification before burnouts occur. The body of the full report offers guidelines for identifying such unprotected ballasts. NIOSHTIC No 0013002...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written in {{collaboration}} with WindFlip AS in order to investigate the behavior of Hywind and WindFlip {{after the release of}} Hywind from the WindFlip vessel. Potential theory has been applied, and no viscosity has been taken into account in any part of the analysis. The interaction between two floating bodies in waves has been the major topic in this thesis. A literature study has been performed on the effects of interaction in steady flow and waves. The findings from the study indicate an increase in motions for the structure placed against the weather, and a reduction in motions for the lee-side structure. This results in a suggested configuration for the release operation, where WindFlip is placed up against the waves and Hywind in the sheltered area behind WindFlip. The motions of a basic single circular cylinder in regular waves are also looked into. By performing simplified analyses in Matlab and Wadam, the fundamental behavior of buoy-like structures such as Hywind and WindFlip was looked into in order to obtain an understanding of how the structures respond to incident waves. The WindFlip barge is to transport the wind turbine lying horizontally on <b>top</b> of WindFlip. <b>Ballasting</b> the barge at location will cause the structures to rotate to vertical position. The flipping procedure is estimated to last about six hours, and within this timeframe the structures will go through many different positions which again will lead to different responses to the waves. Three different positions have been looked into for the coupled WindFlip/Hywind structure, and the results are compared to results from model testing of these configurations. The numerical results compare well to the model test, which implies that the numerical analyses can be trusted and used for further evaluation of the process. Two identical circular cylinders freely floating in waves are looked into by a multibody analysis in the potential theory solver Wadam. The effects of the multibody analyses show the same trends as the literature study – an increase in motions for the weather side cylinder, and a decrease for the lee-side cylinder. The interaction effects do not give large alterations in the motions compared to single body analyses. The reason for this may be the viscous effects in the interaction, which is not accounted for in Wadam. By introducing an offbody point grid showing the free surface around the cylinders we observe lower waves in the wake behind the weather side cylinder. This also corresponds to the sheltering effects found in the literature study, and the reduction in response for the lee side-cylinder found in the multibody analyses. Multibody analyses have been performed for the specific case of WindFlip and Hywind by the use of Wadam. The release configuration suggested from the literature study is applied in the analyses, and regular waves between 5 and 23 seconds are used. Also in this case the responses for the weather side structure (WindFlip) are increased when the spacing between the structures is reduced, and the responses for the lee-side cylinder (Hywind) show a decrease with reduced spacing. The effects from interaction on the response amplitudes are not prominent in this case either, and the viscous effects will most probably have a greater influence on the interaction between the structures. A Matlab script has been made to visualize the motions of the two structures including the interaction effects on the phase angles and response amplitudes. From the visualizations we are able to detect combinations of wave periods and spacing that might be critical for the operation and hence should be looked into more closely. A second Matlab script goes through all possible wave period and spacing combinations, and shows graphically which situations that will cause the structures to collide in either the top or bottom point. The script always uses the response amplitude values for the motions, and by that we end up with an RAO for the horizontal distance between the structures. This RAO for the distance will be further applied by the WindFlip team in order to perform statistical studies on which situations are likely to give collisions between WindFlip and Hywind during the release process. </p...|$|R
