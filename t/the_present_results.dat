60|$|Our only {{conclusion}} is that the psychological conditions which begat the ancient narratives produce the new legends. These surprise us by the apparent good faith in marvel and myth of many otherwise credible narrators, and by the coincidence, accidental or designed, with old stories not generally familiar to the modern public. Do impostors and credulous persons deliberately 'get up' the subject in rare old books? Is there a method of imposture handed down by one generation of bad little girls to another? Is {{there such a thing}} as persistent identity of hallucination among the sane? This was Coleridge's theory, but it is not without difficulties.

60|$|The {{scholarly}} {{method has}} now been applied for many years, {{and what are the}} results? The ideas attained by the method have been so popularised that they are actually made to enter into the education of children, and are published in primers and catechisms of mythology. But what has a discreet scholar to say to the whole business? 'The difficult task of interpreting mythical names has, so far, produced few certain results'--so writes Otto Schrader. {4} Though Schrader still has hopes of better things, it is admitted that <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>results</b> are highly disputable. In England, where one set of these results has become an article of faith, readers chiefly accept the opinions of a single etymological school, and thus escape the difficulty of making up their minds when scholars differ.

60|$|It may be {{that the}} ten commandments and the Book of the Covenant are based upon {{faithful}} traditions of the efforts of a great leader to raise his followers to his own level. For myself, as a matter of pious opinion, I like to think so; as I like to imagine that, between Moses and Samuel, there may have been many a seer, many a herdsman such as him of Tekoah, lonely amidst the hills of Ephraim and Judah, who cherished and kept alive these traditions. In <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>results</b> of Biblical criticism, however, I can discover no justification for the common assumption that, between the time of Joshua and that of Rehoboam, the Israelites were familiar with either the Deuteronomic or the Levitical legislation; or that the theology of the Israelites, from the king who sat on the throne to the lowest of his subjects, was in any important respect different from that which might naturally be expected from their previous history and the conditions of their existence. But there is excellent evidence to the contrary effect. And, for my part, I see no reason to doubt that, {{like the rest of the}} world, the Israelites had passed through a period of mere ghost-worship, and had advanced through Ancestor-worship and Fetishism and Totemism to the theological level at which we find them in the books of Judges and Samuel.|$|E

50|$|Whereas at the {{beginning}} learning involves only basic conditioning, as repertories are acquired the child's learning improves, being aided by the repertoires that are already functional. The way a person experiences the world depends on his/her repertoires. The individual's environment to <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>results</b> in learning a basic behavioral repertoire (BBR). The individual's behavior is function of the life situation and the individual's BBR. The BBRs are both a dependent and an independent variable, as they result from learning and cause behavior, constituting the individual's personality. According to this theory, biological conditions of learning are essential. Biology provides the mechanisms for learning and performance of behavior. For example, a severely brain-damaged child will not learn BBRs in a normal manner.|$|E
50|$|The {{empirical}} research found that European governments adopted multiple strategies during the 1990s {{to fulfill the}} fiscal prerequisites for EMU accession. It concluded that {{the ideology of the}} party in government became the most powerful predictor of fiscal policies and strategies of adjustment. Evidence shows that in the new context, socialist governments preferred to use balanced budgets to finance supply-side policies of capital formation and to maintain public employment, and are reluctant to cut these expenditures even at the expense of public consumption and transfers. In a most broader analysis of the period, from the 1970s to <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> <b>results</b> confirmed the hypotheses that, besides economic conditions, fragmentation of decision-making, ideology of the party in government, and closeness to elections affect fiscal policy in general and adjustment strategies in particular.|$|E

She underwent a formal apprenticeship in calendar divination with a local adept, and was initiated as a diviner in 1976. She says: [...] "The Momostecan calendar embraces both the 260-day cycle and the 365-day solar year, with the four Classic Maya Year-bearers, or Mam, systematically linking the two. The 260-day cycle is conceived as linked firmly to worldly or earthly affairs, mirroring no astronomical period but rather the period of human gestation. Past ethnographic accounts of this cycle contain various conflicting opinions as to what its first day is, but a comparison of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>results</b> and those of previous studies indicates {{that there is no}} fixed first day." ...|$|E

"In {{studies on}} the micro-architecture of {{developing}} brain tissue, {{it has been observed}} that after an initial excess of relatively unorganized synaptic connections, the number of synapses gradually decreased, while the degree of organization of the connections increased (Huttenlocher, 1979; Rakic et al., 1986). It is thus more likely that the observed changes in microstate profile result form the elimination of non-functional connections rather than from the formation of new ones. Another possible relation of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>results</b> with neurobiological processes comes form the observation that with increasing age, asymmetric microstates diminish, while symmetric microstates increase. Assuming that asymmetric microstates result from predominantly unilateral brain activity, while symmetric microstates indicate predominantly bilateral activity, the observed effects {{may be related to the}} growth of the corpus callosum, which continues until late adolescence (e.g., Giedd et al., 1999)." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{toxicity}} of SWNHs {{is a critical}} issue relating to their biomedical application, which has been investigated in vitro and in vivo extensively.

Negative mutagenic and clastogenic potentials suggest that SWNHs are not carcinogenic. The acute peroral {{toxicity of}} SWNHs was found to be quite low—the lethal dosage for rats was more than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. Intratracheal instillation tests revealed that SWNHs rarely damaged rat lung tissue for a 90-day test period, although black pigmentation due to accumulated nanohorns was observed. While further toxicological assessments, including chronic (repeated dose), reproductive, and developmental toxicity studies, are still needed, yet <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>results</b> strongly suggest that as-grown SWNHs have low acute toxicities.|$|E
