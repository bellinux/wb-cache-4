5|$|Othnielosaurus is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur {{that lived}} about 155to 148million years ago, during the Late Jurassic-age Morrison Formation {{of the western}} United States. It is {{named in honor of}} famed {{paleontologist}} Othniel Charles Marsh, and was formerly assigned to the genus Laosaurus. This genus was coined to hold fossils formerly included in Othnielia, which is based on remains that may be too sparse to hold a name; as such, it is part of decades of research <b>to</b> <b>untangle</b> the taxonomy left behind by Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker Cope from the Bone Wars. Othnielosaurus has usually been classified as a hypsilophodont, a type of generalized small bipedal herbivore or omnivore, although recent research has called this and the existence of a distinct group of hypsilophodonts into question.|$|E

30|$|As a final remark, {{the current}} {{findings}} {{are compatible with}} the exhaustive semantic access model and not with the ordered access model, which was supported by Frazier and Rayner’s (1990) eye-tracking study. One possible reason for this discrepancy {{is that while the}} cross-modal lexical priming paradigm, as employed by the current study, displayed quick activations of all meanings associated with an ambiguous word during the initial stage of lexical processing, meanings of different frequencies may still induce differential processing costs at a later stage of lexical access, which the eye-tracking measures reveal. Future research can thus be devoted <b>to</b> <b>untangling</b> the temporal dimension of effects such as meaning frequency, ROM, and contextual congruency using different experimental paradigms.|$|R

The Symposium provides aan opportunity to look bac at these studies and to formulate some methodological and general comments. Success of fisheries management is often jeopardized because change is implemented in a dictatorial way and hindered by bureaucratic slowness as well as technocratic reasoning.

25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt <b>to</b> <b>untangle</b> these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E

Studies of the association between stress and vaccination response in humans were reviewed. There is evidence of a negative association between stress and antibody response to vaccination, which is most apparent with thymus-dependent vaccines and when measured at extended times after vaccination. Preliminary findings implicate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system as potential mechanisms, although a role for unhealthy behaviours cannot be discounted at this stage.

Chopped chiles are used in fish or lamb dishes such as ajoarriero or chilindrón. Pisto is a vegetarian stew with chilies and zucchini as main ingredients.

However, Giacometti had by 1949 used it only in surrealist contexts before Bacon's adaption, and in turn influenced his use in The Cage of 1950. A similar two-dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore's works, notably his maquette for King and Queen, constructed three years after Bacon's Head.

Leal further {{points out that in}} magic realism, [...] "key events have no logical or psychological explanation. The magical realist does not try to copy the surrounding reality or to wound it but to seize the mystery that breathes behind things."

500|$|According to Sorensen, [...] "early {{readers of}} Facundo were deeply {{influenced}} by the struggles that preceded and followed Rosas's dictatorship, and their views sprang from {{their relationship to the}} strife for interpretive and political hegemony". González Echevarría notes that Facundo provided the impetus for other writers to examine dictatorship in Latin America, and contends that it is still read today because Sarmiento created [...] "a voice for modern Latin American authors". The reason for this, according to González Echevarría, is that [...] "Latin American authors struggle with its legacy, rewriting Facundo in their works even as they try <b>to</b> <b>untangle</b> themselves from its discourse". Subsequent dictator novels, such as El Señor Presidente by Miguel Ángel Asturias and The Feast of the Goat by Mario Vargas Llosa, drew upon its ideas, and a knowledge of Facundo enhances the reader’s understanding of these later books.|$|E

500|$|Community {{leaders in}} Lansing have {{proposed}} renaming {{a section of}} Grand River Avenue in Old Town Lansing for César Chávez, the Mexican-American civil rights activist. The group [...] "Lansing for Cesar E. Chavez" [...] was raising funds to rename the section between Oakland and Pine streets in Old Town. Previously, a section of Grand Avenue was renamed for Chávez in 1994, but the voters overturned the decision. The renaming proposal was even mentioned as a way <b>to</b> <b>untangle</b> a maze of different branches of Grand River Avenue running through Old Town. Currently, East Grand River Avenue and North Grand River Avenue bridge between sections of Grand River Avenue, in addition to Grand Avenue which runs along the Grand River near downtown. While Lansing's Latino community supported the proposal, the business community opposed it. One shop owner said she would have $10,000 in costs associated with a name change, adding, [...] "I think there's many beautiful ways to honor such an incredible man. Changing five blocks of a street doesn't seem to do justice." [...] Another business owner cited the work the Old Town Commercial Association has done to market the area using the Grand River Avenue name, marketing that would be useless after a name change. The compromise solution reached in August 2010 was to rename lot 56, where Old Town holds festivals, to Cesar Chavez Plaza. Street signs would be installed marking parts of Grand River Avenue as Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, but only in a memorial capacity; the street would still be officially named Grand River Avenue.|$|E

40|$|Using a within-person approach, we {{investigated}} the boundary {{conditions under which}} activating negative mood may promote or inhibit concurrent creative process engagement (CPE). Drawing on trait activation theory, we propose that dispositional goal orientation (learning goal orientation and avoidance goal orientation) will be expressed in response to trait-relevant work contexts (job control and psychological punishment respectively), thereby moderating the effects of activating negative mood on CPE. As expected, activating negative mood was positively associated with CPE when learning goal orientation and job control were both high. Activating negative mood was negatively related to CPE when learning goal orientation was high but job control was low. Further, activating negative mood had a positive relationship with CPE when both avoidance goal orientation and psychological punishment were low.
