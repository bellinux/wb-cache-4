5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and <b>this</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{engaged in}} a {{strategy}} of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements {{took the form of}} the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of <b>this</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic.|$|E

25|$|Repetition {{involves}} expressing dissent about a topic/issue repeatedly {{at different}} points in time. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> often used when an employee feels nothing is being done to correct the original articulated problem/issue and feel that the issue warrants being repeated. The problem with <b>this</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> that repetition in a short period can be seen as destructive. Especially if the abbreviated time frame does not allow the supervisor enough time to respond. However, if repetition is used over an extended time period it may be considered active–constructive since it may serve as a reminder to the supervisor.|$|E

25|$|By {{combining}} both {{rope and}} mesh bag approaches to bath sponge aquaculture in a “nursery period”, increases may occur in quality and production. In the nursery period method, sponges are initially cultivated in mesh bags until the explants have healed and regenerated to efficiently filter water. The regenerated explants are transferred onto rope to promote optimal growth till harvesting. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> labour-intensive and costly, with growth rates and survival {{found to be}} no greater than when farming occurs solely via the mesh bag method.|$|E
25|$|A model {{organism}} is a non-human {{species that}} is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, {{with the expectation}} that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the use of <b>this</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> {{provided}} by the 2004 Australian Senate election in Tasmania. The Liberal and Labor parties and an independent Labor candidate designated that their above the line vote should transfer to the Family First party in preference to the Green party. Had all voters in Tasmania cast ‘above the line' votes the Green party candidate, who obtained almost a quota of first preference votes, would have lost to a candidate of the little supported Family First party.|$|E

25|$|Operation Halmazag was {{conceived}} {{in line with}} the four-step counterinsurgency doctrine of “Shape-Clear-Hold-Build”. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> described in the US Army Field Manual 3-24 Counterinsurgency. The sequence consists in a previous contact with local friendly authorities to convince the population about the advantages of an improving security environment (shape), the elimination of open insurgent activities (clear), taking measures to make impossible the return of open insurgent presence (hold), and securing the effectiveness of the local government and forces to prevent any further insurgent activity (build). Halzamag was the first operation in Afghanistan whose planning and execution was conducted by the Bundeswehr. A key development toward normalization would be the building of a concrete road linking Char Dara with Quatliam and Isa Khel, under the codename “Little Pluto”.|$|E
25|$|The On-line {{strategy}} makes {{adjustment to}} patient and beam position during the treatment process, based on continuously updated information throughout the procedure. The on-line approach requires a high-level of integration of both software and hardware. The advantage of <b>this</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> {{a reduction in}} both systematic and random errors. An example {{is the use of}} a marker-based program in the treatment of prostate cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Gold markers are implanted into the prostate to provide a surrogate position of the gland. Prior to each day's treatment, portal imaging system results are returned. If the center of the mass has moved greater than 3mm, then the couch is readjusted and a subsequent reference image is created. Other clinics correct for any positional errors, never allowing for >1mm error in any measured axes.|$|E
