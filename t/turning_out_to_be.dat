5|$|Aliens do not {{feature in}} the series, as Grant and Naylor decided {{very early in the}} process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually {{addressed}} with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E
5|$|Between 1993 and 1994, Vikram {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} films where he portrayed supporting roles. He {{appeared in}} three successful Malayalam films by appearing with Mammooty, Suresh Gopi and Jayaram in Joshi's successful action film Dhruvam, before teaming up with Gopi again for Shaji Kailas's Mafia, which explored Bangalore's criminal underworld. Furthermore, Joshi cast him again alongside Mammooty in the action drama Sainyam in the role of an air cadet. During the period, Vikram also appeared in the small budget Telugu film Chirunavvula Varamistava in the lead role and as Akkineni Nageswara Rao's eldest son in the family drama Bangaru Kutumbam with both films failing commercially. A brief return to Tamil films also proved unsuccessful, with his role in Vikraman's multistarrer Pudhiya Mannargal with music composed by A. R. Rahman <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, {{as they have}} few disease problems {{and it is not}} uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15â€“20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E

25|$|It is {{expected}} that BPST-like instantons {{play an important role}} in the vacuum structure of QCD. Instantons are indeed found in lattice calculations. The first computations performed with instantons used the dilute gas approximation. The results obtained did not solve the infrared problem of QCD, making many physicists turn away from instanton physics.

25|$|The Los Angeles trial itself showed {{there was}} a lack of {{physical}} evidence including the sole rape kit <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negative, with no assault findings. To further prove his innocence, Anand Jon submitted to and passed a polygraph test regarding the rape charge for which he was convicted.

25|$|The splashed white {{pattern was}} first studied in Finnish Drafts and Welsh ponies by Klemola in 1933. Klemola's {{multiple}} {{studies on the}} topic have since been largely discredited, his text describing to detail a pattern now recognised as sabino, and his illustrations featuring horses that according to modern knowledge would be a mixture of splashed whites, tobianos, sabinos, and combinations of multiple spotting factors. Originally believed to be very rare outside of Europe, splash is <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more common than previously thought, possibly due to the pattern's tendency to masquerade as modest markings. For example, minimally marked splashed whites {{have been responsible for}} cropouts among American Quarter Horses.|$|E
25|$|Another view {{states that}} BPST-like instantons play an {{important}} role in the vacuum structure of QCD. These instantons were discovered in 1975 by Alexander Belavin, Alexander Markovich Polyakov, Albert S. Schwarz and Yu. S. Tyupkin as topologically stable solutions to the Yang-Mills field equations. They represent tunneling transitions from one vacuum state to another. These instantons are indeed found in lattice calculations. The first computations performed with instantons used the dilute gas approximation. The results obtained did not solve the infrared problem of QCD, making many physicists turn away from instanton physics. Later, though, an instanton liquid model was proposed, <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more promising an approach.|$|E
25|$|Although Burzynski and his {{associates}} claim success {{in the use of}} antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases, and some of the clinic's patients say they have been helped, {{there is no evidence of}} the clinical efficacy of these methods. The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the American Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK among others, is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. While the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity.|$|E

500|$|Chapter 3 {{considers}} {{whether the}} internet and other computing technologies disprove the argument. Cowen writes that while the internet has been fantastic for the intellectually curious, it {{has done little to}} raise material standards of living. The biggest Internet companies employ at most a few thousand people, and relatively few services are paying: [...] "We have a collective historical memory that technological progress brings a big and predictable stream of revenue growth across most of the economy.

500|$|Shearman and Pearson {{analyzed}} the portrayals {{of several of}} the series' regular characters as 1930s villains, noting several meta-references to the wider series. The two noted that, in his portrayal of a Nazi, Jeffrey Spender was allowed to [...] "cut loose and rant like a proper villain rather than a sulky boy hiding in the basement." [...] In contrast, Walter Skinner's 1939 character behaved more like his character in the wider series, his role [...] "charmingly parodying the ambiguity he's been playing all these years and <b>turning</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an American-loving ally who tells our heroes to get their 'asses out of here'." ...|$|E
