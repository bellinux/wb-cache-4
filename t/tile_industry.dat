The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the <b>tile</b> <b>industry</b> has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E
5|$|Combwich Pill, a small creek {{near the}} mouth of the river, had been used for {{shipping}} since the 14th century. From the 1830s, with the development of the brick and <b>tile</b> <b>industry</b> in the Combwich area, the wharf was used by two local brickyards to import coal and export tiles to Wales and parts of Gloucestershire. This traffic ceased in the 1930s; in the late 1950s the wharf was taken over and upgraded by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) to bring in heavy materials for the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations. Construction of Hinkley Point A nuclear power station was ordered in 1957, with a scheduled completion date of 1960, but was not completed until 1965. This was followed by Hinkley Point B nuclear power station, which began operation in 1976. It is proposed to use the wharf again for the construction of Hinkley Point C.|$|E

500|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, {{which had}} been bought out by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1866 and later passed into {{the control of the}} Great Western Railway had, by the {{beginning}} of the First World War, fallen into disrepair due to lack of trade. This trade, particularly the Wales-Somerset traffic after the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886, had been lost to the railways; the canal continued to be used as a source of water. In the mid-1950s, the Port of Bridgwater was importing some [...] of cargo, mainly sand and coal by tonnage, followed by timber and flour. It was also exporting some [...] of bricks and tiles. By then, Bridgwater's brick and <b>tile</b> <b>industry</b> was in terminal decline. In the 1960s, British Rail, the owner of the docks, which were limited by the size of its locks to boats of maximum size , decided that they were commercially non-viable. British Railways offered to sell the docks to any buyer; however, there were no takers, so the docks were closed to river traffic.|$|E
500|$|In {{the medieval}} era {{the river was}} used to {{transport}} Hamstone from the quarry at Ham Hill {{for the construction of}} churches throughout the county. Later, in the 19th century, coal from south Wales, for heating, Bath bricks, bricks and tiles would be carried. Brick making, which had been carried out intermittently in Bridgwater from the 17th century, by the late 18th century had expanded into an industry based on permanent brickyards in the Bridgwater area adjacent to the Parrett. The brick and <b>tile</b> <b>industry</b> made use of the local alluvial clays and the Parrett's coastal trade, using ketches mostly based at Bridgwater to transport their products, which were heavy and bulky, and to bring in coal to heat the kilns. The 19th century industrial revolution opened up mass markets leading to further expansion of the industry, particularly beginning in 1850 when the duty (tax) on bricks was abolished. Brick and tile works, making use of river transport, were opened in the 1840s and 1850s south of Bridgwater at North Petherton and Dunwear, in Bridgwater itself, and downstream at Chilton Trinity, Combwich, Puriton and Pawlett. Numerous brickworks were also opened elsewhere in Somerset, but many of them used the railways to transport their products; some 264 sites are listed in the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society's Gazetteer of sites. Silt was also dredged from the river over a [...] stretch between Somerset Bridge and Castle Fields, Bridgwater, to make Bath bricks, an early abrasive cleaning material patented in 1827.|$|E

Numerical experimentation has shown that it may either enhance or harm performance. Furthermore, there is not yet a general agreement in what a realistic autocorrelation model is or whether it is actually relevant for practical applications. This paper provides a simulation analysis of the effects on performance caused by manufacturing process parameters following autoregressive (AR) processes. AR time series are employed for modeling variations in parameters that happen at a time scale different from the corresponding to process cycle execution. Three basic configurations are analyzed: serial line, assembly process and a disassembly process.

We apply the model to analyse the Spanish ceramic <b>tiles</b> <b>industry</b> where the adoption of the single firing furnace in the 1980 s facilitated the introduction of new product designs as well as to opening new ways of organizing production. Our econometric results show that there is significant complementarity between product and process innovation.
