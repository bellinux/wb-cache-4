40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine the effect of {{interaction}} between implementing <b>total-quality</b> <b>management</b> (TQM) and e-government on the quality of service in the Jordanian public sector. To achieve the objective of the study, a self-administered questionnaire was designed and distributed randomly to 70 middle and top managers working at five governmental institutions. The significance of the study stems from its attempt to clarify the importance of TQM and IT collaboration for administrative-reform programs the public sector. Specifically, the importance of this study lies in the attempt to identify the impact of the integrated relationship between the application of e-government and TQM on improving the quality of service provided by the public sector in Jordan. The results of the study revealed that the studied institutions adopted various dimensions of TQM while implementing some stages of e-government. Also the results revealed a positive correlation between adapting TQM and e-government on service quality. Finally the study uncovered the relationship and impact of the interaction between implementing TQM and e-government on quality service in the Jordanian public sector...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. The {{manufacturing}} sector {{has produced a}} wide variety of techniques in its attempts to find the ultimate solution for the manufacturing process, with these techniques ranging from material requirements planning, just-in-time production, <b>total-quality</b> <b>management,</b> flexible manufacturing systems and computer integrated manufacturing to advanced planning and scheduling. Given the fact that the technique entitled "advanced planning and scheduling" in the manufacturing environment is primarily aimed at resource planning and scheduling during the production process, however, a clamant need was created for manufacturing companies to broaden their focus in order to include all the processes involved in the production environment, as well as the external processes impacting on productivity. A large area that came into focus owing to the latter paradigm shift is known as "supply chain management". Supply chain management is concerned with the integration of and communication between the various elements in the entire supply chain, including elements such as demand planning and forecasting, scheduling, customer sales, supplier purchases, production planning and forecasting, resource planning and warehouse management. This research study will be devoted to an investigation into the issues surrounding supply chain management and all its manifestations, including its basic components and their integration and interaction. This investigation will also cover research into scheduling systems up to current reactive constraintbased scheduling systems, since scheduling is deemed to be the core of the supply chain in terms of the influence it exerts on most other components, be it directly or indirectly. The investigation will also take us into the realm of an exciting new technology whose exponents are known as "intelligent software agents", which agents are aimed at providing autonomy to the objects within a system and which agents are characterised by their behaviour and decision processes. The said agents can be used to perform highly specialised tasks during the manufacturing process, such as scheduling and forecasting. A prototype system will be developed {{in the course of the}} research in a bid to illustrate the integration, evaluation and monitoring of the supply chain elements through the use of intelligent agents. By endowing the system with intelligence, the researchers hope to identify many future uses for intelligent agents in the various segments of the supply chain...|$|E
