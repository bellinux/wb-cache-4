The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{memorial}} stone was erected at Black River, Jamaica, near where Zong would have landed. A sailing ship representing Zong was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 {{to commemorate the}} 200th anniversary of the Act for the Abolition of <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> Trade, {{at a cost of}} £300,000.

5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} {{example of the}} horrors of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade, stimulating {{the development of the}} abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s.

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of <b>The</b> <b>Slave</b> Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of <b>The</b> <b>Slave</b> Community. Despite criticisms, <b>The</b> <b>Slave</b> Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E

50|$|More {{than half}} a century later, when Grenada was {{captured}} by the British during the Seven Years' War (1762) and formally ceded to Britain by the Treaty of Paris, the English began the import their own African slaves for use on their cotton, sugar and tobacco plantations. It is believed that most <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> imported to Grenada embarked from Nigeria (specifically Igbo and Yoruba, more than 37,000, 34% of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of <b>the</b> island) and Ghana (Fante people, more than 18,000, 19% of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of <b>the</b> island). To a lesser extent, slaves were also were imported from Senegambia (more than 5,000, 4.9% of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of <b>the</b> island), Guinea, Sierra Leone (more than 12,000, 11% of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of <b>the</b> island), Windward Coast (more than 14,000, 13% of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of <b>the</b> island), Bight of Benin (more than 5,800, 5,4% of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of <b>the</b> island), Congo (specifically Kongos) and Angola. <b>The</b> <b>slaves</b> of Central Africa numbered more than 12,000 people, 11% of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of Grenada. Many of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> were also Mandinka.The first British census of Grenada, in 1700, recorded 525 slaves and 53 freed <b>slaves</b> living on <b>the</b> island. Julien Fédon, a mulatto plantation owner of the Belvedere estate in the St. John Parish, led a violent rebellion against British rule on the night of 2 March 1795. Clearly influenced by the ideas emerging from the French Revolution, especially the Convention's abolition of slavery in 1794, Fédon and his troops took control of all of Grenada (except the parish of St. George's, the seat of government), who afterwards freed <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> who participated in the rebellion. The struggle of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> for their rights continued {{for a year and a}} half (between March 1795 and June 1796), until the British regained control of the island. The British, as a punishment for disobedience and rebellion, executed the alleged leaders of the rebellion, however Fédon was never captured. Slavery in Grenada was finally abolished by a British law in 1834, and all slaves were freed by 1 August 1838.|$|R
5|$|From the 1830s onward, Mobile {{expanded}} into {{a city of}} commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the coastwise slave trade from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade – people to make clothes, food, and supplies for <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> traders and their wards. The city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from New York City, which was {{deeply involved in the}} cotton industry. Mobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by Montgomery.|$|E

5|$|Magoffin's {{plan was}} to unite <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> states around a set of minimum {{concessions}} {{to see if the}} North would accept them as an alternative to war.

5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming {{an important part}} of the Elizabethan exploration.

As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade, John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> who became {{an important part of}} the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade, was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s, however, {{witnessed}} {{the publication of}} revisionist studies that departed from the traditional historiography of slavery.

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E
