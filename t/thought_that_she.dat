It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was pregnant by this time. Her son, Pedro Pablo, was born on 30 July 1813. Pedro Pablo was adopted by Encarnación Ezcurra and her husband, Juan Manuel de Rosas, who she had married shortly before.|$|E
5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she told them {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not hear from her that evening, they first <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E
5|$|In September, Mary {{was fully}} {{prepared}} to depart for the Netherlands and resume her post {{when she was}} informed of Charles's death. Distressed {{by the death of}} another sibling, the Queen, who had suffered from a heart disease most of her life, had two heart attacks in October. Both were so severe that her doctors <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had died. When Joan visited her, Mary was still determined to fulfill the promise she had given to Charles and assume the regency in the Netherlands, but she was weak and feverish. She died only few weeks later, in Cigales on 18 October 1558.|$|E

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in {{disguise}} fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank's role in breaking Napoleon's Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children– Fanny, Felix, Paul and Rebecka– the best education possible. Fanny became a well-known pianist and amateur composer; originally Abraham had <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But at that time, it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, {{for a woman to}} have a career in music, so Fanny remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it.|$|E
5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be You at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E
5|$|In July 1822, Edward Williams and Percy Shelley drowned {{when their}} boat sank during a storm while {{returning}} to Lerici from Pisa. Shortly before their deaths, Jane dreamed of floods {{and on one}} occasion <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had seen Shelley's ghost through a window. After hearing of their deaths, Jane and Mary travelled back to Pisa for the funerals of their husbands; Williams and Shelley were cremated on consecutive days in August 1822. After Shelley's cremation, Jane was forced to settle a dispute between Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt {{over what to do}} with what they believed was the unburnt heart of Percy Shelley. Though Hunt had initially taken it from Shelley's pyre, Mary insisted that he return it to her. Though Hunt was initially unwilling to do so, Jane later convinced him that it should be returned. Mary Shelley and Jane Williams briefly settled in Albaro, before proceeding to Genoa together. There they separated in September due to Jane's desire to quickly return to England. Jane brought Edward's ashes with her back to England.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after 15:25, {{and without}} warning, {{a series of}} violent explosions tore through the rear part of the ship. She capsized five minutes later. Some <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been torpedoed by a German U-boat or detonated a submarine-laid mine, but {{examination}} of the wreckage revealed that the explosions were internal. The divers sent to investigate the ship reported that the explosions began in either the rear 9.2-inch shellroom or the 3-pounder and small arms magazine. The Admiralty court-martial into the causes of her loss concluded that it was caused by an internal ammunition explosion, possibly due to faulty cordite. The Admiralty issued a revised list {{of the dead and}} missing that totaled 390 in January 1916, but did not list the women and children on board that day. Losses are listed from 390 to 421.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E

50|$|The {{concluding}} {{third of}} the novel recounts Renée’s travels {{from one place to}} another. This part of the story is told primarily in the form of letters to Maxime, sprinkled with accounts of performances, and thoughts about her relationship with him.

25|$|Belle {{only made}} a few {{appearances}} in the strip, but is remembered because of the Belle stuffed animal toys sold in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many {{people who were not}} regular readers of the comic strip mistakenly <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was Snoopy's girlfriend, rather than his sister. In Snoopy's World War I fantasies, Belle is a nurse.|$|E

25|$|Castalia {{was built}} in 1874 by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, Leamouth for the English Channel Steamship Company.

25|$|The initial medical {{prognosis}} was that Meili would succumb to her injuries and die. She was given last rites. The police initially listed the attack as a probable homicide. At best, doctors <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would remain in}} a permanent coma due to her injuries. She {{came out of her}} coma 12 days after her attack, and spent seven weeks in Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem. When she initially emerged from her coma, she was unable to talk, read, or walk.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, Blackwell {{established}} a women's {{medical school in}} London with Sophia Jex-Blake, {{who had been a}} student at the New York Infirmary years earlier. Blackwell had doubts about Jex-Blake, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was dangerous, belligerent and tactless. Nonetheless, Blackwell became deeply involved with the school, and it opened in 1874 as the London School of Medicine for Women, with the primary goal of preparing women for the licensing exam of Apothecaries Hall. Blackwell vehemently opposed the use of vivisections in the laboratory of the school.|$|E

She ran this Camp Fire Group for some 6 years, until the move to Sussex. One of the Camp Fire members was Margaret Bayne Todd - later Margaret, Lady Simey - who appears in Abbey Girls in Town and to whom that title was dedicated.

25|$|Louisa Ulrika {{was born}} in Berlin as the {{daughter}} of Frederick William I of Prussia and his wife Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, and was thus a younger sister of both Wilhelmine of Bayreuth and Frederick the Great. She was given the Swedish name Ulrika because Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden had been her god mother. She exchanged letters with her godmother, and it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would marry a future son by Ulrika Eleonora, as Ulrika Eleonora herself had once been considered as a consort for Louisa Ulrika's father.
