25|$|Determined to trap Cafferty {{once and}} for all, Rebus uses his {{contacts}} {{to set up a}} sting operation, with child molester Andrew McPhail being used as the unwitting bait. Cafferty is caught red-handed attacking McPhail outside the Operation Moneybags surveillance, and is arrested. With Cafferty in jail, the police are able to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at his operation. A farm in the Borders is raided, where Cafferty used to personally execute his enemies. Deek Torrance is amongst those arrested there. In exchange for leniency, Eddie Ringan agrees to testify against Cafferty.|$|E
25|$|The general {{analysis}} strategy begins with high resolution cameras {{to look for}} features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize {{a small portion of}} it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.|$|E

During the Mission Status briefing, lead Flight Director Mike Sarafin said that after having the crew focus the camera on the left OMS pod, it did not appear that there was any damage, but the image analysis team would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at the area.|$|E
25|$|Timekeeper {{announced}} that guests were {{just in time}} for a meeting between H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Nine-Eye hid from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells were hidden. After a brief conversation about their conflicting visions of the Future, Wells walked away, leaving Verne with a model of his Time Machine, which Verne had just criticized as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, Nine-Eye rebutted his claim and appeared to the author. Jules Verne decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at her and tried to grab her. Timekeeper, seeing this, tried to bring her back to the present, but accidentally took Verne as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} paradoxical role of AMPK {{occurs when}} we <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> {{look at the}} energy-sensing enzyme in relation to exercise and long-term training. Similar to short-term acute training scale, long-term endurance training studies also reveal increases in oxidative metabolic enzymes, GLUT-4, mitochondrial size and quantity, and an increased dependency on the oxidation of fatty acids; however, Winder et al. reported in 2002 that despite observing these increased oxidative biochemical adaptations to long-term endurance training (similar to those mentioned above), the AMPK response (activation of AMPK {{with the onset of}} exercise) to acute bouts of exercise decreased in red quadriceps (RQ) with training (3 – see Fig.1). Conversely, the study did not observe the same results in white quadriceps (WQ) and soleus (SOL) muscles that they did in RQ. The trained rats used for that endurance study ran on treadmills 5 days/wk in two 1-h sessions, morning and afternoon. The rats were also running up to 31m/min (grade 15%). Finally, following training, the rats were sacrificed either at rest or following 10 min. of exercise.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Colonel Smith {{heard the}} {{exchange}} of fire from his position in the town moments after he received the request for reinforcements from Laurie. He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead toward the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them. Smith {{was concerned about the}} four companies that had been at Barrett's, since their route to town was now unprotected. When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look. [...] One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed, [...] "If we had fired, I believe we could have killed almost every officer there was in the front, but we had no orders to fire and there wasn't a gun fired." [...] During a tense standoff lasting about 10 minutes, a mentally ill local man named Elias Brown wandered through both sides selling hard cider.|$|E

Despite the SDS-940 crashing earlier in the day, the presentation went off without any major technical glitches. One last notion is that of Engelbart's NLS system. As Fred Turner stated in his book From Counterculture to Cyberculture: [...] "Engelbart promulgated a philosophy of 'bootstrapping', in which each experimental transformation of the socio-technical system that was the NLS would feed back into the system itself, causing it to evolve (and presumably to improve)." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{feminine}} {{categorization of}} Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of Antony and Cleopatra was often summarised as either [...] "the fall {{of a great}} general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it {{can be viewed as}} a celebration of transcendental love." [...] In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony's masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women's Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at both Shakespeare's characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{maintain that}} scripture {{in the original}} languages contains no prohibition of homosexuality, but does record same-sex marriage. [...] "But if we <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look, reading the scripture in the original Hebrew and Greek, we discover that God never condemned homosexuality, and that same-sex marriage existed in Bible times." [...] "To tell a homosexual that the Bible is Good News, (but that) it says that their ability to love on a one-to-one basis (mate level) means they are sinful and perverted in God's eyes is a gross contradiction in terms. What's more, God is not saying this to gay people. God's Word is this: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16, KJV). And that is the Good News for modern gays." ...|$|E
2500|$|John F. Montgomery, {{who served}} in Budapest as U.S. {{ambassador}} from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the Budapest opera house by chanting [...] "Justice for Szálasi!" [...] loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look, he discovered that:two or three men were {{on the floor and}} he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.|$|E
