Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players' shorts in 1969.|$|E

40|$|DE 10126430 C UPAB: 20020910 NOVELTY - <b>The</b> <b>backing</b> {{material}} application {{method has}} <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> material introduced into a housing (1) {{provided with a}} transducer element (2) at its front side via a rear opening (3), before high speed rotation of the housing via a rotation device, so that <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> material is subjected to a centrifugal force {{in the direction of}} the transducer element. USE - <b>The</b> <b>backing</b> material application method is used during manufacture of an ultrasonic transducer with a piezoceramic transducer element using an inverse piezoelectric effect, for preventing backwards radiation of sound waves. ADVANTAGE - The centrifugal force ensures that all recesses etc. are filled by <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> material...|$|R

5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars) are broad and long, extending {{to the front}} margins of the first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina, extending between the molars, but the foramina are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. The palate itself is wide and short, with its back margin between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (foramina) are present on the palate. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> margin of the palate is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> margin, as is present in Rhipidomys. Wilfredomys has <b>the</b> <b>back</b> margin U-shaped instead and has a longer palate, with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> margin behind the M3s.|$|E

5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges {{on the inside of the}} nasal cavity and a ridge at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
25|$|The {{scales were}} wired {{together}} in horizontal rows that were then laced or sewn to <b>the</b> <b>backing.</b> Therefore, each scale had {{from four to}} 12 holes: two or more at each side for wiring to the next in the row, one or two at the top for fastening to <b>the</b> <b>backing,</b> and sometimes one or two at the bottom to secure the scales to <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> or to each other.|$|R
50|$|Villain {{cards are}} laid out similar to Hero cards.

The background on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of a Villain card {{is a pair of}} evil-looking eyes. Similar to the Hero cards, some images show villains in contexts from their non-native universe.|$|R

5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width at <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the front is virtually equal to the width at <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> so that the tooth is about rectangular. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at <b>the</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the house. One of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located toward <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the main room, were also present {{in many of the}} houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
50|$|Dry {{transfers}} (also called rub-ons or rubdowns) are decals {{that can}} be applied without the use of water or other solvent. The decal itself is on a backing material such as paper or plastic sheeting much like a transparency. The dry transfer is placed in the desired location with <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> side up. <b>The</b> decal is then applied by burnishing <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> with a stylus or similar object such as a ballpoint pen. The contact side of the decal includes a pressure-sensitive adhesive; the combination of heat and pressure causes the decal to stick more strongly to the new surface than to <b>the</b> <b>backing.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> is removed, <b>the</b> decal remains. This allows for ink only where needed even if the pattern is delicate, because <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> supports <b>the</b> decal while it is being applied.|$|R
50|$|The {{scales were}} wired or laced {{together}} in horizontal rows that were then laced or sewn to <b>the</b> <b>backing.</b> Therefore, each scale had {{from four to}} 12 holes: two or more at each side for wiring to the next in the row, one or two at the top for fastening to <b>the</b> <b>backing,</b> and sometimes one or two at the bottom to secure the scales to <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> or to each other.|$|R

5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a tow truck.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of jerseys. This was {{because there was no}} major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} screentone sheet {{consists of}} a flexible transparent <b>backing,</b> <b>the</b> printed texture, and a wax adhesive layer.

40|$|A {{flexible}} pile {{thermal barrier}} insulator included {{a plurality of}} upstanding pile yarns. A generally planar <b>backing</b> section supported <b>the</b> upstanding pile yarns. <b>The</b> <b>backing</b> section included a plurality of filler yarns forming a mesh in a first direction. A plurality of warp yarns were looped around said filler yarns and pile yarns in <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> section and formed a mesh in a second direction. A binder prevented separation of the yarns in <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> section...|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{computer}} technology, patches were made by hand. The general process, however, remains the same today. First, a fabric backing is cut to shape. To prevent fraying, the edges of <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> are heat-sealed. Then, the thread is stitched into place. Some designs incorporate <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> as <b>the</b> background of the patch, while others completely cover <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> with stitches. To finish the patch, iron-on adhesive may {{be applied to the}} reverse—a step that was not originally done.|$|R
