5|$|Responding to {{international}} pressures, in 1991 the Soviet government allowed a joint U.S.-British inspection team to tour {{four of its}} main weapons facilities at Biopreparat.

5|$|To {{overcome}} elevator issues, {{the tower}} will use its {{large number of}} efficient elevators {{as well as its}} three sky lobbies, which allows transfers to be made between elevators serving a specific area with no elevator being overburdened. Much was learned from Burj Khalifa that helped with the design of Jeddah Tower not only structurally, but in methods for designing practical mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems, as well as adhering to local regulations and international building codes. Despite all the physical challenges, Adrian Smith states that practicality is still the greater challenge over structural durability, even in such super-tall designs, and that as with all buildings, Jeddah Tower's form was primarily derived respective of what the building's uses would be, then in accordance with the structural factors {{that would have to be}} considered <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature.

40|$|Abstract—Data reneging {{occurs when}} a data {{receiver}} first SACKs data, and later discards that data from its receiver buffer prior <b>to</b> <b>delivering</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the receiving application or socket buffer. Today’s reliable transport protocols such as TCP and SCTP are designed to tolerate data reneging. We argue that this design assumption is wrong, in part based on a hypothesis that data reneging rarely if ever occurs in practice. To support our hypothesis, we present a model for detecting instances of data reneging by analyzing traces of TCP traffic. Using this model, we will investigate the frequency of data reneging in Internet traces provided by CAIDA. Keywords- Data Reneging; SACK; SCTP; TC...|$|R

25|$|In an Engine Management System (EMS), {{electronics}} control {{fuel delivery}} and ignition timing.
