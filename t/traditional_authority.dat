5|$|By {{taking this}} new role, Rainilaiarivony {{became the first}} Hova to {{concurrently}} serve as both Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The sociopolitical transformation that had been triggered by the strangling of RadamaII reached its zenith with Rainilaiarivony's consolidation of administrative power.

The Prime Minister issued new policies and laws in the Queen's name. However, the day-to-day governance, security and diplomatic activities of the kingdom principally originated with, and were managed by, Rainilaiarivony and his counselors. This new level of authority enabled the Prime Minister to amass a vast personal fortune, whether through inheritance, gifts or purchase, including 57 houses, large plantations and rice paddies, numerous cattle and thousands of slaves.

As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally; Jean-Jacques Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{their power}} {{not from the}} ballot box but from a {{supposedly}} ancient wellspring of power, hereditary <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> in postcolonial Africa have frequently posed challenges for incoming ‘democratic’ governments. The situation in post-apartheid South Africa is no different. However contentious their role under the colonial and apartheid systems of government was, the Constitution of the new South Africa (1996) recognised <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> and afforded them opportunities for a political resurgence. This paper reviews the changing status of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> in the Eastern Cape Province over the twenty years since 1994. It explores the resurgence of the chiefs {{in relation to the}} consolidation of both democratic processes and of emergent, neo-patrimonial modes of government. It briefly considers the role of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> in three key and closely related spheres, namely the institution of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders, the question of how gender is handled by and within traditional institutions, and the continuing challenges of land administration and development in rural areas. In all these spheres, and in the face of real opposition, the voice and influence <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> have emerged stronger than ever. We conclude by suggesting that as they are drawn deeper into governance and have to play a formal role in addressing the myriad institutional challenges, new questions will and should be asked about the status and influence of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities,</b> and their substantive contribution to democracy in South Africa...|$|R
25|$|The {{growing number}} of Protestants, Evangelicals and Word of God Catholics {{challenging}} <b>traditional</b> <b>authority</b> has caused religious strife {{in a number of}} indigenous communities.

In the 1970s, caciques began to expel dissidents from their communities for challenging their power, initially with the use of violence. By 2000, more than 20,000 people had been displaced, but state and federal authorities did not act to stop the expulsions. Today, the situation has quieted but the tension remains, especially in very isolated communities.|$|E
25|$|Alexandria, in the Nile delta, was {{established}} by Alexander the Great. Its famous libraries were a center of Hellenistic learning. The Septuagint translation of the Old Testament began there and the Alexandrian text-type is recognized by scholars {{as one of the}} earliest New Testament types. It had a significant Jewish population, of which Philo of Alexandria is probably its most known author. It produced superior scripture and notable church fathers, such as Clement, Origen, and Athanasius, also noteworthy were the nearby Desert Fathers. By the end of the era, Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch were accorded authority over nearby metropolitans. The Council of Nicaea in canon VI affirmed Alexandria's <b>traditional</b> <b>authority</b> over Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis (North Africa) (the Diocese of Egypt) and probably granted Alexandria the right to declare a universal date for the observance of Easter, see also Easter controversy.

25|$|Another {{factor was}} {{the decline of}} the <b>traditional</b> <b>authority</b> structures. Jewish {{autonomy}} remained quite secured; later research debunked Simon Dubnow's claim that the Council of Four Lands' demise in 1746 was a culmination of a long process which destroyed judicial independence and {{paved the way for the}} Hasidic rebbes to serve as leaders (another long-held explanation for the sect's rise advocated by Raphael Mahler, that the Khmelnytsky Uprising effected economic impoverishment and despair, was also refuted). However, the magnates and nobles held much sway over the nomination of both rabbis and communal elders, to such a degree that the masses often perceived them as mere lackeys of the land owners. Their ability to serve as legitimate arbiters in disputes – especially those concerning the regulation of leasehold rights over alcohol distillation and other monopolies in the estates – was severely diminished. The reduced prestige of the establishment, and the need for an alternative source of authority to pass judgement, left a vacuum which Hasidic charismatics eventually filled. They transcended old communal institutions, to which all the Jews of a locality were subordinate, and had groups of followers in each town across vast territories. Often supported by rising strata outside the traditional elite, whether nouveau riche or various low-level religious functionaries, they created a modern form of leadership.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{interactive}} process between decentralized structures and <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> in Wenchi district, {{with a view}} to generating lessons and insights that can guide the recommendation of a more appropriate decentralization framework to tap the strengths of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> towards accelerated rural development. Within the framework of action research methodology, mixed-methods were used to triangulate findings and enhance research rigour. Specific methods employed were focus group discussions (FGDs), in-depth interviews (IDIs), and observation, complemented by context analyses of relevant documents. It was found that the interactive processes between <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> and decentralized structures are characterized mainly by competition for power and legitimacy, leading to mistrust and an inability {{to take advantage of the}} synergy effect between the two systems of local governance in accomplishing accelerated rural development. Key recommendations are that <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> should not be fused with the decentralized structures, but should remain as countervailing institutions to check the misuse of power by the decentralized structures. However, <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> should be given the ceremonial role of the right to address meetings of the District Assembly and the Area Councils.

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{historical}} {{analysis of the}} embattled structures of rural local governance in South Africa, with specific reference {{to the role of}} <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> in Xhalanga in the Eastern Cape. More specifically, the book illustrates how at least in the Xhalanga district chieftainship was contested from the establishment of the district in 1865 to the advent of democracy in South Africa. Two related themes are addressed: the question of the survival of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> up to the postcolonial/apartheid era and the question of how <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> derive their authority and legitimacy. The book shows that the survival of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> can be linked directly to their control of the land allocation process, rather than popular support. The issue of the legitimacy of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities,</b> especially in a democracy, is investigated against the background of the tension in the 1993 Interim Constitution and the 1996 Constitution, which recognized the institution of traditional leadership. These constitutions, along with emerging post- 1994 legislation, advocated a form of democracy that was based on the liberal principles of representation at all levels of government, including local government, while, at the same time, recognizing a hereditary institution of traditional leadership for rural residents.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{political}} implications of the constitutional recognition of the hereditary institution of traditional leadership in post- 1994 South Africa for the democratization process in the rural areas of the former Bantustans. The thesis is organized around three related conceptual, historical and political questions. The conceptual question deals with the meaning of democracy in rural areas under the jurisdiction of <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities.</b> The historical question traces how the institution and <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> have survived to the present post-colonial period. Lastly, this study investigates the political issue of why an ANC-led government came to recognize the institution. The focus of the thesis is the sphere of rural local government in the Xhalanga district, where these issues are best illustrated. The thesis argues that the institution of traditional leadership and its officials survived precisely because they were incorporated into the colonial and apartheid administrative structures in the project of indirect rule. <b>Traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> were central to the apartheid policy of retribalisation, which was essentially a form of control of Africans in the Bantustans. Rural residents engaged in fierce struggles against the imposition of rural local government structures such as the District Council and Tribal Authorities. In so far as <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> were part of government structures, they could not avoid being targets in these struggles. In explaining the recognition of the institution of traditional leadership, the thesis focuses on the policies of the ANC, the majority party in the Government of National Unity, towards <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities.</b> Organisationally weak on the rural grounds, the ANC operated through what they considered to be “good/progressive/comrade chiefs”. The ANC had hoped that these <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> would accept a non-political ceremonial role. However, <b>traditional</b> <b>authorities</b> have rejected this ceremonial role. Their refusal, coupled with the ANC’s ambivalence in resolving the tension imply, the study concludes, that the (political) citizenship rights of rural people are partial: they are neither citizens nor subjects...|$|R
