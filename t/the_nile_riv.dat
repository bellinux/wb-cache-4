50|$|Despite {{covering}} {{only about}} 6.5% {{of the total}} area of Egypt; <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> Valley and <b>Nile</b> Delta are <b>the</b> most important regions, being the country's only cultivable regions and supporting about 99% of <b>the</b> population. <b>The</b> <b>Nile</b> valley extends approximately 800 km from Aswan {{to the outskirts of}} Cairo. <b>The</b> <b>Nile</b> Valley is very cool and known as Upper Egypt, while <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> Delta region is known as Lower Egypt. Steep rocky cliffs rise along the banks of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> in some stretches, while other areas along <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> are flat, with space for agricultural production. In the past, flooding of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> during <b>the</b> summer provided silt and water to make agriculture possible on land that is otherwise very dry. Since construction of the Aswan Dam, agriculture in <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> valley depends on irrigation. <b>The</b> <b>Nile</b> delta consists of flat, low-lying areas. Some parts of the delta are marshy and water-logged, and thus not suitable for agriculture. Other areas of the delta are used for agriculture.|$|R

40|$|Two interrelated {{developments}} can {{be identified}} in <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> basin, during <b>the</b> last decade: an emphasis on potential conflict over <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> waters on <b>the</b> one hand, and an evolving process of basin-wide cooperation on the other. The history of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> basin is dominated by tensions and conflicts. Relationships between major Nile basin countries are usually {{described in terms of}} mutual distrust and confrontation. <b>The</b> <b>Nile</b> basin, moreover, has frequently been referred to by many observers and analysts as an example where conflict over water resources as a result of water scarcity will lead to armed confrontation. Recent years, on the other hand, have witnessed a growing cooperation among the basin countries. <b>The</b> <b>Nile</b> Basin Initiative (NBI) is a case in point. All the ten countries that share <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> waters agreed, for the first time, to cooperate on development of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> basin. This is a significant step, although a number of serious problems and challenges remain. Many donors have made formal pledges to support the initiative. This paper reviews literature on <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> basin cooperation and issues related to this process, focusing on more recent publications. The literature on utilization and management of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> waters related to basin-wide cooperation efforts has been growing fast during the last decade. At least seven books have been published on the subject between the years 2000 to 2002, while the number of papers presented at conferences and articles in various journals and on the Internet is enormous. This review discusses and covers a wide range of issues, which include: debate on water scarcity and its potential consequences in general, and its implications for <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> basin countries in particular; legal aspects of utilization of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> waters focusing on the UN Watercourse Convention of 1997; conflicts and major attempts at cooperation; divergent views and interests of the basin countries; and challenges and prospects of the recent basin-wide cooperation. 1 : Introduction. 2 : Water scarcity: cause of conflict or opportunity for cooperation. 3 : Legal aspects of utilization of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> waters and <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> basin cooperation. 4 : Conflict and cooperation along <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> River. 5 : The NBI: the new evolving cooperation. 6 : Ten riparians, one Nile: divergent interests of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> basin. 6 : Challenges and prospect...|$|R
